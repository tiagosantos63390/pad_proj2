On April 12, 1894, in Pecos, Miller was confronted by Frazer about his involvement in the murder of cattleman Con Gibson. Frazer did not wait for Miller to go for his shotgun, shooting him and hitting him in the right arm. While Miller was attempting to fire his gun with his left hand, hitting a bystander, Joe Krans, Frazer fired again, hitting Miller in the groin, which finally put him down. Frazer emptied his six-shooter into Miller's chest. After Miller's friends had rushed him to a doctor, his frock coat was removed to reveal the large steel plate that Miller wore under his clothes, which resisted most of the bullets from Frazer's gun, saving the assassin's life. Miller would recover

Initial history and family.

From his debut, Callahan became the template for a new kind of movie cop: an antihero who does not hesitate to cross professional and ethical boundaries in pursuit of his own vision of justice, especially when the law is poorly served by an inept bureaucracy. The "Dirty Harry" archetype does not shy away from killing; all of the "Dirty Harry" films feature Callahan killing criminals. His rationale for such conduct is that it is done with the greater good in mind: protecting the innocent and victims of crime. Callahan's methods are rarely endorsed by his superiors, who on various occasions have demoted, suspended or transferred him to other departments.

Meanwhile Sheena's group was fast gaining popularity, and was dubbed the 'Nameless Ones' by the local media, which also called her "the woman Messiah". Starting in 1957, Peter and Eileen Caddy first co-managed a run-down hotel in Scotland, the Cluny Hill Hotel near Forres, Moray, which they reportedly resurrected and turned it into a four star hotel following the practical guidance given by the 'voice'. Early in 1962, the couple along with most of the staff were sent by the management to resurrect another of their properties, the Trossachs Hotel, at Perthshire, and when they rallied to be shifted back to Forres closer to their 'mission', they were fired.

Directors like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Atma Ram, Gulzar repeatedly cast him in the period 1971-1974 and his work got noticed through these films. These roles he did from 1971-1974 set the tone for a number of supporting and comic roles in his career and in 70's his demand was at its peak as he appeared in 101 films from 1970-1979 and had effective roles in them. Though initially Rajesh Khanna and Asrani had met only on sets of Bawarchi, they became close friends after Namak Haraam, after which for the role of comedian Rajesh Khanna insisted the producers and directors to make Asrani part of his films. Asrani worked in 25 films with Rajesh Khanna from 1972-1991 from Bawarchi(1972) to Ghar Parivaar(1991).

He was hugely talked about in the 1970s and was one of Rajesh Khanna's close friends. He became a regular feature in films produced by D. Rama Naidu and those movies directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, B.R.Chopra, K. Bapaiah, Narayana Rao Dasari, K. Raghavendra Rao, Basu Chatterjee in 1972-1992.

The songs picturised on Asrani and sung by Kishore in Hindi are Achcha Chaloji Baba Maaf Kardo from Hamare Tumhare, Pyar Main Karoonga from Yeh Kaisa Insaaf. The song 'Mannu Bhai Motor Chali Pam' was sung by him with Kishore Kumar and was picturised on Rishi Kapoor and him, in 'Phool Khile Hain Gulshan Gulshan' in 1978.
However studies suggest that a large proportion of shoppers are tempted to shoplift due to the relative ease of fooling self checkouts. For example, a person who (without intent to steal) does not scan an item, may remember this was easy and fail to scan other items deliberately. A 2012 survey with 4952 respondents in the UK found that a third of shoppers had stolen this way, with around a quarter of the remainder stating they were deterred by the risk of detection. Non-barcode items such as produce, and store staff overriding (or ignoring) checkout alerts were singled out as vulnerabilities, and poverty was not seen as a major factor. Overall as at 2012, the founder of one store video surveillance system estimated that "Theft — intentional or not — is up to five times higher with self checkout than when cashiers are working", although the behaviours of shoplifting are becoming well known, and stores better at detecting them. A 2014 survey in of 2634 respondents confirmed the same general findings, but commented that the cost of additional theft was evidently seen as "tolerable" compared to the cost of other processes, such as manned checkouts, and harm due to poorer customer service arising from the slowness of manned versus automated checkouts.

"Maliseet Vocabulary" includes English translations for about 1,600 Maliseet words, arranged in 29 categories. Given Chamberlain's status as a naturalist and bird enthusiast, he managed to record 481 Maliseet words related to plants and animals, including 124 Maliseet words for different types of birds. Some of this profusion of natural-world vocabulary is also inherent in the Maliseet culture: for example, the book includes six different Maliseet words for birch bark, depending on the status of the bark. 98 of the words are place name proper nouns, and 156 words are listed as of post-European-contact origin (mostly constructed of Maliseet roots while a few are transliterations of English and French words), including fourteen words related to guns.
