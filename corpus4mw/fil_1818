Around this time Kendall had begun an affair with Tungaroa, one of his school pupils who worked as a servant in his household. She was the daughter of a Rakau, a prominent M훮ori tohunga or priest and wise man. When the affair was discovered the pair eloped, living among nearby Maori. However, the relationship had ended by April 1822. Jane took Kendall back, although he was unapologetic. One sailor wrote his rationalisation of the relationship with a M훮ori woman was ""in order to obtain accurate information as to their religious opinions and tenets, which he would in no other way have obtained"". Kendall indeed began a serious flirtation with M훮ori religious beliefs, an exploration he set out in a series of seven letters between 1822 and 1824. In 1822 he wrote that the "sublimity" of M훮ori spirituality saw him "almost completely turned from a Christian to a Heathen".
