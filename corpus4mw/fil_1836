French nobility has always had a clear separation. The nobility carried swords as a symbol of their nobility. In the seventeenth-century, it was said that all nobles were allowed to carry a sword to prove their nobility except the nobles of the long robe. As a result, the separation between the nobility of the sword and the nobility of the robe has been evident. The only similarity between the two was the fact that both groups were nobles. Low-ranking nobles were able to receive their higher status by serving in the military; they were a part of the nobility of the sword. The members of the nobility of the robe, however, became nobility by buying their title. The nobility of the sword were the nobles seen to hold power at Versailles and who ran provinces. They held the most prestige, although they had lower incomes; however, the nobility of the robe weren’t as prestigious as the nobility of the sword.

Stalin was also enraged by Tito's aspirations to merge Yugoslavia with Bulgaria (and therefore create a true "Land of the South Slavs"), an idea with which he agreed in theory, but which had also taken place without prior Soviet consultation. He summoned two of Tito's officials, Milovan Đilas and Edvard Kardelj, to Moscow to discuss these matters. As a result of these talks, Đilas and Kardelj became convinced that Yugoslav-Soviet relations had already reached an impasse.

Among their postseason highlights was the May 20, 1975, game three of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals. This game, known as the fog game, was memorable because Buffalo Memorial Auditorium had no air conditioning and the arena temperature matched the 90 degree outdoor temperature, which caused fog to shroud the ice surface. During the overtime, play was delayed seven times due to fog on the ice surface at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The players were instructed by Flyer coach Fred Shero and Sabre coach Floyd Smith to shoot whenever possible because of the impaired goaltender vision. Eventually, the French connection combined to score a Martin to Perreault to Robert game-winning goal. This came after the French Connection swarmed Flyer goalie enabling Bill Hajt to knock in a Rick Martin rebound to send the game to overtime.

There is evidence for a link between a vergence abnormality in which there is a reversed crossing of foveal projection such that a foveal convergence stimulus is executed as a divergence movement (in place of a convergence movement) and the occurrence of schizophrenia.

In his prime, Andrews was regarded as arguably the most bruising, powerful running back in the NFL. Ronnie Lott would later state that a head-on-collision he had with Andrews during a game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Falcons on December 19, 1982 was the hardest hit that he had received during his NFL career. In addition to leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 1981, Andrews also finished in the top four in that category three other times. Despite the brevity of his career, Andrews is still the Falcons' all-time yards from scrimmage leader with a total of 8,633. He was named as the Falcons Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1983. To celebrate his career, his number 31 was retired in 2004 by the Falcons. Andrews was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.
