The one fall "Lightning" match between Máximo and Rey Bucanero started out slowly, with Rey Bucanero refusing to even enter the ring, disgusted by his opponent's overly flamboyant "Exótico" actions, including trying to kiss Bucanero. Once the match actually started Maximo tried to kiss his opponent on at least two occasions, with the attempts angering Rey Bucanero so much that he angrily attacked Maximo, defeating him in under six minutes. In the fifth match of the night Místico "La Nueva Era" teamed up with Ángel de Oro and La Máscara to take on "Los Hijos del Averno" (Averno, Ephesto, Mephisto), a group that often fought the original Místico when he worked for CMLL. The "Rudo" team quickly overwhelmed Místico, Ángel de Oro and La Mascara as Mephisto pinnedn Místico mere minutes into the match. The "tecnico" team fought back in the second fall as they evened the score between the two teams. In the third fall Averno fell victim to Místico and moments later "La Nueva Era" pinned Mephisto to win the match for his team.
