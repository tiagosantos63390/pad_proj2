University tuition fees in Nova Scotia are among the highest in the country. This is in large part due to low government grants to fund university operating costs.

As a result, fees in Nova Scotia far surpass the median income or saving potential of its population. Other shortages make the province inaccessible to students, such as the elimination of the loan remission program in 2000. It is the only province without a non-repayable student financial assistance program.
