Montgomery grew up in a poverty-stricken area and starred at West Jefferson High School in Harvey, Louisiana. His brother, Sean, a member of the U.S. Junior Olympic wrestling team, developed problems related to schizophrenia. To help his brother, Montgomery accepted a scholarship to Houston, where his 12 sacks during his 1988 senior season was one short of a team record. Concerned about the welfare of his brother, he almost left the school, but he was talked out of it by the coaches.

In mathematics, the Freudenthal magic square (or Freudenthal–Tits magic square) is a construction relating several Lie algebras (and their associated Lie groups). It is named after Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits, who developed the idea independently. It associates a Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras "A", "B". The resulting Lie algebras have Dynkin diagrams according to the table at right. The "magic" of the Freudenthal magic square is that the constructed Lie algebra is symmetric in "A" and "B", despite the original construction not being symmetric, though Vinberg's symmetric method gives a symmetric construction; it is not a magic square as in recreational mathematics.

European Space Council and current concerns.
Donald Dinnie, the son of a stonemason, won his first sporting event, at the age of 16, in the nearby village of Kincardine O'Neil. He defeated the local wrestling strongman David Forbes, and took first place which included £1 prize money. In 1860, Dinnie undertook a feat of strength that was to give birth to a long-lasting legacy. He carried two boulders, with a combined weight of , for a distance of about , across the Potarch Bridge and back. Each boulder had an iron ring fixed to it, so that scaffolds could be attached from which workmen could repair the bridge, over the River Dee near Kincardine O'Neil. The original stones are now located outside the 18th-century Potarch Hotel, on the south bank of the river by the Potarch Bridge.

"Amnesia" represented another step in the development of Al Columbia's technique. While he had made striking use of sharp outlines and silhouettes in earlier works such as "I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool" and "The Blood-Clot Boy", in "Amnesia" he used a combination of watercolor, acrylic paint, ink, charcoal, and digital tools to create minutely detailed chiaroscuro backgrounds that contrast with the cartoony look of the characters. As Paul Gravett commented: "Al works his flat, outlined Seymour and his pal into what look like soft focussed stills from some vintage black and white animated film. His bigfoot characters scurry about amongst period buildings and backgrounds that are richly textured and photorealist, bathed centre stage in glowing light, but shrouded in threatening shadow in the wings. He bans all speech bubbles and sets his perky text in eye-straining type above the image or in framed boxes."
