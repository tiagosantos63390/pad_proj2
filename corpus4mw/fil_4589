Emperors responded to the increased insecurity with a steady build-up of the forces at their immediate disposal. These became known as the "comitatus" ("escort", from which derives the English word "committee"). To the Praetorian Guard's 10,000 men, Septimius Severus added the legion "II Parthica". Based at Albano Laziale near Rome, it was the first legion to be stationed in Italy since Augustus. He doubled the size of the imperial escort cavalry, the "equites singulares Augusti", to 2,000 by drawing select detachments from "alae" on the borders. His "comitatus" thus numbered some 17,000 men, equivalent to 31 infantry "cohortes" and 11 "alae" of cavalry. The trend for the emperor to gather round his person ever greater forces reached its peak in the 4th century under Constantine I the Great (ruled 312â€“37) whose "comitatus" may have reached 100,000 men, perhaps a quarter of the army's total effective strength.

Amblyphylla is a genus of moth in the family Gelechiidae.
Bare Mountain, above sea level, is a prominent peak of the Holyoke Range of traprock mountains located in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts, and part of the greater Metacomet Ridge that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. The peak rises steeply from the river valley below; its bald summit offers sweeping views. Bare Mountain is located within the towns of Amherst and South Hadley, Massachusetts. Part of its northeastern flanks are in Hadley and part of its southern flanks are in Granby. It is traversed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail.
