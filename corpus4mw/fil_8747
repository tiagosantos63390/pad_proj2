During the July Monarchy, the 2nd Dragoon Regiment dropped the name "Doubs", and was among several that were favoured by Louis Philippe I, and called to the maneuvers and festivities at his camp at Compi√®gne every two years. In 1832, it participated in the suppression of the June Rebellion. Charles-Marie-Augustin de Goyon, who would be a senior general of the Second Empire, served as its colonel from 1846 to 1850. Under de Goyon, the regiment earned the nickname of ""demoiselles de Goyon"", owing to his high standards for drill and dress. During the 1848 Revolution, the officers of the regiment kept their men calm and disciplined, much to the relief of the citizens of its garrison town of Beauvais.
