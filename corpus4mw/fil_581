Primus' approach to developing a movement language and to creating dance works parallels that of Graham, Holm, Weidman, Agnes de Mille and others who are considered to be pioneers of American modern dance. These artists searched literature, used music of contemporary composers, glorified regional idiosyncrasies and looked to varied ethnic groups for potential sources of creative material. Primus, however, found her creative impetus in the cultural heritage of the African American. Fusing spirituals, jazz and blues and then coupling these music forms with the literacy works of black writers, Primus' choereographic voice - though strong - resonated primarily for and to the black people on whose experiences her works were based. Her style, her themes and her body type promoted modern dance among African Americans. Primus' strong belief that rich choreographic material lay in abundance in the root experiences of a people has been picked up and echoed in the rhythm and themes of Alvin Ailey, Donald McKayle, Talley Beatty, Dianne McIntyre, Elo Pomare and others.

The Movement is the second solo studio album by Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck. A departure from "Uncontrolled Substance"'s darker, soul-inspired sound, "The Movement" is more upbeat and expressive. According to Inspectah Deck, ""Uncontrolled Substance" was just me as an ill lyricist wanting to put an album out. I just wanted to be heard. "The Movement" is like is me behind the scenes, behind everything. I'm doing ... everything. All the credits got Inspectah Deck on it this time. I was able to put my soul into it."

On March 13, (1st Old Style Date), 1881, Alexander II was traveling in a two-seater carriage. An armed Cossack sat next to the coach-driver with Alexander II in the carriage while six other Cossacks followed on horseback. As the carriage approached a street corner near the Catherine Canal, Sophia Perovskaya gave the signal to Nikolai Rysakov and Timofei Mikhailov to throw their bombs. The Tsar was unharmed but two were wounded. Alexander II insisted upon leaving the carriage to check on the wounded. At this point Hryniewiecki who was leaning against the railing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw his bomb and the blast tore the Tsar apart. Just before throwing the bomb he was alleged to have shouted "It is too soon to thank God", in response to the emperor saying "thank God I'm untouched" to the anxious inquires of his entourage. Nearby, Hryniewiecki himself lay unconscious from the blast.

This suggestion fell right into James's plans for Barbara since he decided to use this as a means to get Barbara locked away so he'd get control of Fashions. Later, he was found dead in Australia. Afterwards, Barbara next set her sights on newspaperman Brian McColl. Soon, the couple fell in love and made plans to marry. Paul was vehemently against the marriage and caused trouble. Continually argumentative, at one point, Paul hit Brian several times and when Brian raised his hand, instinctively, to hit back, Barbara walked in and railed into Brian. Disgusted at Barbara's tendency to let Paul dictate her life, Brian broke off the engagement. With the encouragement of her friend (and Brian's former stepmother) Lisa McColl, Barbara tried to go to his place to take him back, only to find Shannon O'Hara in the room wearing Brian's bathrobe. From that moment, Barbara vowed to no longer be victimized by men. Soon a different Barbara Ryan emerged. Later, Barbara attempted to seduce Tom Hughes, now married to Margo Montgomery (James's former mistress). Though her attempt was unsuccessful, she did put a cramp in the Hughes marriage after lying to Margo that she and Tom had made love. Since Tom had been drunk on the day in question, he had no idea if it was true or not. When Tom "confessed" to Margo, she left town for several months, leaving Barbara free to comfort a heartbroken Tom.
