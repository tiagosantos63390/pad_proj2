When Philip died in 1506, Sittow lost his patron again. In the same year, he returned to Reval where his stepfather, the glass-maker Diderick van Katwijk had seized his parents' houses, as Michael's mother had died in 1501. Van Katwijk had journeyed to Brabant in 1501 and offered a property settlement to Sittow that the latter refused. As the local court did not support Sittow's claim for inheritance, he had to go to the Court of Higher Instance in Lübeck. He won the case in Lübeck, but could not officially register his parents' houses as his property until the death of his stepfather in 1518.

In 2001 WGSM was sold to K Communications for $2.5 million. The format was changed to Korean language programming. Over the next few years, WGSM spent a lot of time on and off the air.

The two met in his Flushing broadcast center, and presented a proposal to Kwon and two associates to lease the station---then still known as WGSM, to flip it to country, with a secret formattics (A blend of Country-Rock) to be confidential until the station was announced operational again.

A 2013 study by Harvard and University of NSW (Australia) researchers found that NAD+ given to mice resulted in astonishing aging reversal. Two-year-old mice were given the compound over a week, moving back the key indicators of ageing to that of a six-month-old mouse. 
These codon changes which can occur due to A to I editing at these sites can lead to a maximum of 32 different mRNA variants leading to 24 different protein isoforms. The number of protein isoforms is less than 32 since some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. Another editing site, site F has also been located in the exon complementary sequence (ECS) of intron 5. The ECS required for formation of double stranded RNA structure is found within intron 5.
