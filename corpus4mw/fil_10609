The South Korean missile is generally considered a superior next-generation missile compared to the Harpoon and Exocet systems. It uses an Inertial Navigation System (INC) and Global Positioning System (GPS) to guide it toward its target, using a radio altimeter to maintain altitude.

It was designed to be deployed in an active electronic warfare environment, fitted with both detection and countermeasures systems.
