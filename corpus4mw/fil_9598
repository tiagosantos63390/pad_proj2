In 1908 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the legitimacy of Commonwealth's right to prohibit individuals and corporations from operating integrated schools. The decision in Berea College v. Kentucky extended the 1896 opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson to include colleges and universities specifically on the grounds that they were charted by the state. The Kentuckian Justice John Marshall Harlan dissented, as he had done with Plessy v. Ferguson, that it was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and was a governmental intrusion on citizens' private lives. The Supreme Court fifty years later took a position similar to Justice Harlan in its ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka.

The English therefore had no alternative but to tow their vessels into the nearest friendly harbor, that being Tétouan on the Barbary coast. Once there fresh supplies were bought in and the inhabitants treated them favorably. News soon trickled in of the repulse of the galleys and the governor extended gifts upon them and granted them stay for as long as they wanted. After around four days and with the wind now in their favor, the English sailed off without incident; the Spanish in the harbor of Algeciras unable to intercept them because of their severe damage or the rough sea.
