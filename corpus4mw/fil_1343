Compilations.

"Acanthocheilonema viteae" is one of the few filaroids that do not bear "Wolbachia" bacteria. Infection with "Wolbachia" is essential to the continued good health and reproduction of their nematode hosts. Molecular studies suggest that "Acanthocheilonema viteae" either lost their symbionts before they became essential or diverged from other filaroids before "Wolbachia" acquisition (Schmidt and Roberts, 2009).

The G-20 was proposed by former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as a forum for cooperation and consultation on matters pertaining to the international financial system. The group was formally inaugurated in September 1999, and held its first meeting of finance ministers in December 1999. It studies, reviews, and promotes high-level discussion of policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability, and seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization. With the G-20 growing in stature after the 2008 Washington summit, its leaders announced on 25 September 2009, that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations. Since its inception, the G-20's membership policies have been criticized by numerous intellectuals, and its summits have been a focus for major protests by anti-globalists, nationalists and others.
