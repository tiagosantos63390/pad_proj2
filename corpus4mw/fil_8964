During the 1890s Pfister began to take a commanding role in the state's Republican party. After the Democratic party came to control the state government in 1891, they brought suit against former state treasurers and their bondsmen when it was revealed that state funds had been deposited in favored banks with the earned interest unaccounted for. Pfister, U.S. Senator Philetus Sawyer and other members of the Republican “Old Guard” had been the treasurers’ bondsmen, with Pfister being liable for over $100,000 in funds. The Democrats had succeeded in retrieving half the state’s money, but when the Republicans came back to power in 1894 they stopped prosecuting the treasury cases. Pfister worked behind the scenes to push bills through the Republican legislature that absolved the former treasurers and their bondsmen. The bills were reluctantly signed by the stalwarts’ choice for governor, William H. Upham.
