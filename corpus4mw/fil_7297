According to Hungwe mythology, taken down by ethnologist, in olden times, a poverty-stricken people known as the Dziva were dwelling on a mountain. They ate food raw because their chief, Madziva, had lost the fire that his daughters kept in a sealed horn containing oil. Hunters from the north, the Hungwe's ancestors, came into the land. They had fire and ritually smoked a pipe to sustain their magical force. Their chief gave fire to Madziva, married his daughter, and Hungwe became the first "king" (mambo). Many people united around him, and even Madziva became his servant.
