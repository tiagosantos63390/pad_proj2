Visitors would take a train from the Twin Cities and arrive in Buffalo only an hour later. Buffalo remained a popular resort destination from the 1890s until the 1920s.

Today, many visitors still come to Buffalo for the fishing on Lake Pulaski and Buffalo Lake, as well as for shopping in the many boutiques and antique shops.
