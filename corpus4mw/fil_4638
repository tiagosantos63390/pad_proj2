Out West (disambiguation)
From 1931 to 1973 the Old Sessions House served as the headquarters of W & T Avery Ltd., manufacturers of weighing-machines and scales. After their departure the building fell into further disrepair, until in 1978 it was acquired and restored by a masonic trust, and the following year opened as the London Masonic Centre, incorporating conference and social facilities. In 2013 it was announced that it was to be sold to the proprietors of Home House, a private members' club in London's West End, to be run as a similar amenity in an area which is becoming increasingly known for its growing number of technology companies.
