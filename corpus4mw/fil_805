For people who do not work for the Department of State (DOS), there is much confusion about the relationship between the DS and the DSS. Even within Department of State there is still some confusion regarding the difference between DS and the DSS. The DSS was structured as a law enforcement agency, primarily made up of Federal Agents. The DSS is an organization within DS.
If one ball is pulled away and is let to fall, it strikes the first ball in the series and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity and almost instantly swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the Last ball. This shows that the final ball receives most of the energy and momentum that was in the first ball. The impact produces a shock wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel will do this as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat.
As graphics processing units evolved, major graphics software libraries such as OpenGL and Direct3D began to support shaders. The first shader-capable GPUs only supported pixel shading, but vertex shaders were quickly introduced once developers realized the power of shaders. Geometry shaders were recently introduced with Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.2.

Atlantis is a 1913 Danish silent film directed by August Blom, the head of production at the Nordisk Film company, and was based upon the 1912 novel by Gerhart Hauptmann. It starred an international cast headlined by Danish matinée actor Olaf Fønss and Austrian opera diva Ida Orloff. The film was the first Danish multi-reeled feature film. The story, which tells the tale of a doctor who travels to the United States in search of a cure for his ailing wife, includes the tragic sinking of an ocean liner after it strikes an object at sea. Released only one year after the sinking of the RMS Titanic, the movie drew considerable attention as well as criticism due to similarities to the actual tragedy.

"Confusion" is a single released by British group New Order in August 1983 with the catalogue number FAC 93. It was the follow-up to their massive club hit "Blue Monday" and is unique for having both Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner playing bass guitars on it. The song is produced by influential New York DJ Arthur Baker. As a result it was recorded in New York, unusual for the band (though in September 1980 the band, as a three-piece, recorded the first versions of "Ceremony" and "In a Lonely Place" at E.A.R.S. (Eastern Artists Recording Studio) East Orange, New Jersey USA). Three remixes served as B-sides on the initial 12" release: "Confused Beats", "Confusion Instrumental" and "Confusion Rough Mix".

Architecture.
According to "Dune: House Corrino", the underground catacombs of the Imperial Necropolis cover "as much area as the magnificent Palace itself. Generations of fallen Corrinos inhabited the city of the dead, those who had succumbed to treachery or accidents; a few had even died of natural causes." It is noted that "After moving the Imperial capital from ruined Salusa Secundus, Emperor Hassik III had been the first to be entombed beneath the megalithic building. Over the ensuing millennia, numerous Corrino emperors, concubines, and bastard children were also buried here. Some had been cremated and their ashes displayed in urns, while the bones of others were ground up to make porcelain funereal pieces. A few rulers were encased in transparent sarcophagi, sealed within nullentropy fields so that their bodies would never decay, even if their meager accomplishments were obscured by the fog of passing time ... As the need for burials continued century after century, the necropolis had been dug deeper, with more crypts hollowed out. In the lowest and most recent subterranean levels, Shaddam actually recognized some of the names of his ancestors." Shaddam's elder brother Crown Prince Fafnir had been laid to rest among "coffins and chambers for children and siblings," his tomb marked by an "idealized statue" of him. Also in the necropolis is the walled-up vault of Emperor Shaddam IV's grandfather, Fondil III, known as "the Hunter" — his tomb is "flanked by the stuffed carcasses of two ferocious predators the man had killed: a spiny ecadroghe from the high plateaus of Ecaz and a tufted saber-bear from III Delta Kaising." It is noted that "Fondil, however, had taken his epithet from hunting men, ferreting out enemies and destroying them. His big-game adventures had been a mere diversion." The mummy of the "long-forgotten" ruler called Mandias the Terrible, known as "the Emperor who made worlds tremble," is hidden in the Imperial Necropolis "in a chamber fronted by a fearsome, life-size statue" of Mandias. Shaddam IV notes when looking at Mandias' body: "I am not impressed ... Nobody even remembers him."

The Wannier functions for different lattice sites in a crystal are orthogonal, allowing a convenient basis for the expansion of electron states in certain regimes. Wannier functions have found widespread use, for example, in the analysis of binding forces acting on electrons; they have proven to be in general localized, at least for insulators, in 2006. Specifically, these functions are also used in the analysis of excitons and condensed Rydberg matter.
