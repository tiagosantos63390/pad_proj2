The FJ20ET was installed in the DR30 Skyline RS/RS-X/RS-X Turbo C and S12 Gazelle/Silvia RS-X; Turbo C versions of the DR30 were intercooled, as well as some S12 RS-X trim cars. The plenum chamber was shortened in the S12 compared with the DR30 because of the smaller engine bay and thus produced slightly less torque and power. However the DR30 plenum can be fitted into the S12 engine bay with very little clearance.

The 1893 Black February floods caused severe flooding in the region and devastated the city. Raging flood waters destroyed the first of several versions of the Victoria Bridge. Even though gold was discovered north of Brisbane, around Maryborough and Gympie, most of the proceeds went south to Sydney and Melbourne. The city remained an underdeveloped regional outpost, with comparatively little of the classical Victorian architecture that characterized southern cities.
The station has one platform, on the north side of the line. The waiting room is situated on this, with the 1938-built signal box and ticket office further west. A footbridge connects with the car park on the site of the former westbound platform. The unused side of the platform is where the S&DJR trains to Bath and Bournemouth used to reverse after connecting with trains on the Exeter to London line. The area once occupied by the large Upper Yard beyond the signal box is now overgrown by trees.

Let formula_1 be an open set in formula_2 and formula_3 a closed discrete subset. For each formula_4 in formula_5, let formula_6 be a polynomial in formula_7. There is a meromorphic function formula_8 on formula_1 such that for each formula_10, the function formula_11 is holomorphic at formula_4. In particular, the principal part of formula_8 at formula_4 is formula_6.
Although many films about gangsters preceded "The Godfather", Coppola's nuanced treatment of the Corleone family and their associates, and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was an innovation. He took it further with "The Godfather Part II", and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, opened the doors for more and varied depictions of mobster life, including films such as Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" and TV series such as David Chase's "The Sopranos".
