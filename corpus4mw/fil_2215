The thirty ships carried 30,500 colonists. Unlike Columbus's earlier voyages, this group of colonists was deliberately selected to represent an organized cross-section of Spanish society. The Spanish Crown intended to develop the West Indies economically and thereby expand Spanish political, religious, and administrative influence in the region. Along with him also came Francisco Pizarro, who would later explore western South America and conquer the Inca Empire. Another ship carried Bartolomé de las Casas, who became known as the 'Protector of the Indians' for exposing atrocities committed by Ovando and his subordinates. Hernán Cortés, a family acquaintance and distant relative, was supposed to sail to the Americas in this expedition, but was prevented from making the journey by an injury he sustained while hurriedly escaping from the bedroom of a married woman of Medellín.
Lift-off oversteer (also known as snap-oversteer, trailing-throttle oversteer, throttle off oversteer, or lift-throttle oversteer) is a form of oversteer in automobiles that occurs while cornering when closing the throttle causes a deceleration, causing the vertical load on the tires to shift from the rear to the front, in a process called weight transfer. This decrease in vertical load on the rear tires causes a decrease in the lateral force they generate, so that their lateral acceleration (into the corner) is also decreased. This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn, hence oversteering. In other words, easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction, with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first.

It should be noted that Balboa called the Pacific the "Mar del Sur" and referred to it as "la otra mar", the other sea, by contrast with the Atlantic, evidently with Behaim’s concept of only two oceans in mind. The "Mar del Sur", the South Sea, was the part of the Indian Ocean to the south of Asia: the Indian Ocean was the "Oceanus Orientalis," the Eastern Ocean, as opposed to the Atlantic or Western Ocean, the "Oceanus Occidentalis" in Behaim’s two ocean world.

Numerous small explosives, strategically placed within the structure, are used to catalyze the collapse. Nitroglycerin, dynamite, or other explosives are used to shatter reinforced concrete supports. Linear shaped charges are used to sever steel supports. These explosives are progressively detonated on supports throughout the structure. Then, explosives on the lower floors initiate the controlled collapse.
The xi ϵ X are engaged Processual Agents such as individuals, groups (e.g. committees, task forces, virtual teams, etc.), and even organizations. The dimension and measures for the entries, rij , are chosen for the purposes of an analysis. It is important to realize that in this representation of group and organizational structures, the entries rij reflect the actual relationship between its members relevant to the purposes of the study. Please note the asymmetry: rij rarely equals rji . Also, in some applications, not all of the Processual Agents xi ϵ X are, in fact, human.

The Partido was named Pago until 1730, then Partido de Matanza y Pozos (Partido of Slaughter and Wells): it was then a largely unpopulated rural area, and was led by a two-mayor system.

The school opened in 1892 as Mauge Street Grammar School, taking on the name "A.R. Johnson Junior High School" in 1937. From 1945 to 1949, it served as a senior high school and in 1956, a new building was erected to serve as the junior high school. In 1980, the school was established as an examination school. In 1980–81, A. R. Johnson Junior High School became “A. R. Johnson Health Professions High School”. Under its new name, the school served as a pilot program, using funds from a Magnet Implementation/Planning Grant.

The tree is planted along the banks of rivers or arroyos for firing. It is found throughout Thailand especially in open, wet places. Therapeutic uses of this plant in the country are for anthelmintics (the parts used were seeds, roots and leaves) and curing venereal disease (the parts used are roots and wood). Studies of the chemical constituents of this plant have revealed that alcoholic and other extracts from the roots and seeds could kill earthworms. Extracts from seeds display antibacterial properties.
During April 1980, a group of Dominican industralists began to meet with the intention of formalizing a stock market and creating a regulating body guarded by the transparency and the efficiency of the operations in this market. This group consisted of Ricardo Valdéz Albízu, Hector Rizek, Ramón Mena, Winston Marrero, Otto Montero, Frederic Eman-Zadé, Luis Sabater and Rosendo Alvarez III. During 1987 this original group contacted Robert Bishop, the former vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, to assist with the markets creation. The Dominican Republics first stock exchange finally came into legal existence under Presidential Decree No. 554-89 that was passed on February 20, 1989, but actually did not begin formal operations until December 1991. It was originally known as the "Bolsa de Valores de Santo Domingo Inc". In 1997, as a result of the fact that its activities extended into other cities of the country, it changed its name to "Bolsa de Valores de la República Dominicana". This means that the market is still relatively new, and the concept of both an equity and capital market is just coming into consciousness. Despite the limitations resulting from inadequate legislation, transactions at the BVRD grew steadily during the 1990s.

In 2003, the art galleries at Mason Gross held ‘’Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University, 1958-1972’’ to coincide with the release of a book by the same name by Geoffrey Hendricks. It featured artifacts from performances by Rutgers-affiliated Fluxus artists. The Flux Mass was re-staged that year on November 1 (in the same chapel as the original Flux Mass) as part of a series of performances to accompany the exhibition. The mass was also re-created at Amherst College.
