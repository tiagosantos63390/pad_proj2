H.R. 4185 would make changes to the District of Columbia Official Code that governs the D.C. Courts system. Based on information provided by the court system, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the proposed changes would not have a significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending because it would authorize the Court Services and Offender Service Agency (CSOSA) to accept and spend monetary gifts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that the net effect on direct spending would be insignificant. Enacting H.R. 4185 would not affect revenues.
