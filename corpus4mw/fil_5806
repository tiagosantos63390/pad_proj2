Will Carden, the novel's protagonist, is fifteen years old at the start of the story. His family has "come down" in the world: though his late father had once owned a steel mill, Will and his mother and siblings now survive by growing vegetables on a two-acre plot of land. Will is popular with the local children, especially with the five Williams siblings who live in the big house in the town of Bingham. Of the five, Mary Louise is the beauty; her twelve-year-old sister Annabel is plain in comparison, with red hair and freckles and a "pug nose." Their father owns the steel mill that succeeded the Carden mill as the town's leading employer; their mother, the snobbish Mrs. Williams, wounds Will by telling her children to avoid the lowly "vegetable boy."

The Yarloop Workshops are situated in the town of Yarloop Western Australia, where they operated from 1901 to 1978. Originally built by Millers on the site of the first timber mill in the area, the operations expanded to become the support facility for Millers' 26 timber mills and the rail network that connected them. The workshops hand-crafted most of the parts necessary to maintain the equipment rather than experience delays in obtaining parts from the United Kingdom. After suffering extensive damage from Cyclone Alby in 1978, Millers moved their operation to a site just outside the town on the South Western Highway. The site then changed ownership a number of times until it was brought by Bunnings in 1983.
