In 1996, 450 Squadron was deactivated and was formally disbanded on Jan. 1, 1998. On May 2, 2012, the squadron was re-established to be the home of the Canadian Forcesâ€™ CH-147F Chinook helicopters, based out of CFB Petawawa.
The barn is located on the west side of Foster Hill Road (Maine State Route 145), in Freeman Township, a former town about north of Farmington which was incorporated in 1803 and disincorporated in 1934. The property on which the barn stands has uncertain ownership prior to 1825, and has always been referred to in property records as Lot 8, Range G. The barn stands behind a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house which also appears to date to the first half of the 19th century, whose historical integrity has been compromised by alterations including the application of modern siding. The buildings are surrounded by several acres of fields and former orchard, beyond which lie woods.
