Survey seasons for "Bache" followed much the same pattern, with summer in the north and winter in the south, until 1876 when emphasis shifted to Florida. The previous northern work was extended, closing the season on September 24, 1875, a period of refitting for southern work that included a detailed harbor entrance survey at Fernandina, Florida, from December 1, 1875, through January 3, 1876, that included mapping a changed shoreline of Cumberland Island. In the fall of 1876 work on the east coast of Florida, between Matanzas Inlet and Mosquito Inlet, was delayed by generally bad weather and an October hurricane that also destroyed shore navigation signals. The survey work continued southward for 1877–1878 and included Cape Canaveral and nearby shoals the following survey season with a return north to refit. During June of that season future rear admiral, then Lieutenant, Uriel Sebree was among the officers attached to "Bache" under Lieutenant Commander C. M. Chester, USN

From the 1980s until the early 1990s, the younger DT2s became refurbished. They received a new front (with one window instead of three) because the old ones were susceptible to rust. Because of the refurbishment, the units could be used for another 20 years. The rebuilt units were called "DT2-E". The unrefurbished older units were retired until 2002.
History.

Because of his "Notes sur le siècle de Louis XIV", La Beaumelle was arrested on 24 April and imprisoned in the Bastille till 12 October 1753. In 1755 he went to Holland and met with Henri de Catt. Soon after his return to Paris, the publication of his "Mémoires de la Maintenon" brought him again for a year in jail (September 1757). Voltaire seems both times to have been involved. After his release, La Beaumelle settled down as a freelance writer in Toulouse (1759), but without permission to leave the Languedoc. La Beaumelle got involved in the case of Jean Calas. In 1764 he married his daughter. Around 1770 King Louis XV appointed him at the "Bibliothèque Royale", and granted him a pension.
He largely outfitted John McDouall Stuart for four of his six northern expeditions, brother John having supplied everything for the first, and the Government providing for the sixth. This last expedition set out with great ceremony on 25 October 1861 from James's residence on Montefiore Hill, North Adelaide, where he died of complications from a carbuncle without learning of its successful outcome.
In 1988, Zanko transferred to Division 2 Group A side Dunkerque. He made a total of 37 league and cup appearances during his first season at the club, and scored his first goal for Dunkerque in the 3–1 away win over Le Mans on 22 April 1989. Zanko spent two more years with the team, playing in a further 53 league matches. He moved to Division 3 outfit Valence in the summer of 1991, and scored once in 30 appearances as the side won promotion to Division 2 at the end of the 1991–92 season. The following season he played 28 matches, again scoring once, as the team finished fifth in their group to secure their place in the new nationwide Ligue 2. Zanko played two more seasons with Valence, making a total of 50 league appearances.
