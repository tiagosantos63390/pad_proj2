On KindWeb, Jud Conway wrote, "Somewhere between his busy schedule teaching guitar workshops and producing, recording, and performing with a veritable 'who's who' of jam band royalty, Falzarano has managed to release "We Are All One", his third proper solo album, on Woodstock Records... Having worked as a rhythm guitarist with or for many of the guest artists appearing on "We Are All One", Falzarano promotes the solo project as a quasi-group effort, informally crediting the album to 'Michael Falzarano and Extended Family'... In essence, because the basic tracks for "We Are All One" were recorded during multiple sessions and with numerous musicians over a period of several years, Falzarano was able to turn the tables on high-profile players and solicit "their" uninhibited support in helping him to realize "his" musical vision. Consequently, Michael Falzarano delivers one of the most compelling and organic albums in his extensive discography."
Maxwell described Alex as "a sexy young aristocrat" and said he did not think he was anything like his character. Udall called Alex a "thrusting young newcomer", while a writer for the "Daily Mirror" said he was "an arrogant, self-centred womaniser." Of Alex, Maxwell later said "I have to find a positive side to his character but I have to admit it can be pretty hard with a person like Alex. He is weak-willed, arrogant and motivated by self-preservation. He is certainly not going to be the most popular person in "Emmerdale"."

In the Beagles' second season, they were far more successful than the previous year, winning every game and dominating most games. The offence got a boost with the arrival of Adam Shepherd, who racked up 20 points in 8 games, and Julian Meurer and Dan Fisher who were both point-per-game players. The defence was equally as solid, with new additions Donald McCabe and Andrew Sills providing excellent offensive options on the blue-line and Kris Madden, Francis Anderson and Courtney Andrews supplementing with great back-checking. Behind this solid defense, Christopher Gray was able to rack up three shutouts, the first time in Eagles or Beagles history that a goalie managed to achieve a shutout in a league game.
