The first run of the F1.08 was at an exclusive three day test at the Valencia circuit in Spain. Heidfeld had the duty of testing the F1.08 whilst teammate Kubica drove the F1.07B for the duration of the three day test with the exception of the first day where Heidfeld drove the F1.07B. However when the team returned to the same circuit to test the F1.08 on 23 January, it was shown to be slow in comparison to its competitors and the team's previous pace. Technical director Willy Rampf played down rumors of a lack of speed and confirmed that the car would be running in a revised form at the Barcelona test on 1 to 3 February 2008.

Battledykes is a Roman Camp established slightly to the north of Forfar, Scotland. According to Hector Boece, Pictish chiefs met at a castle by Forfar Loch to plan how to repel the Roman armies, who invaded several times between the 1st and 4th centuries AD. Eventually the better equipped Romans prevailed, to be displaced again by the Picts. The Romans established a Roman Camp at Battledykes, approximately three miles north of Forfar; this camp was assessed to have held 50,000 to 60,000 men. From Battledykes northward the Romans established a succession of camps including Stracathro, Raedykes and Normandykes.

The movie ends with a scene at Georgia's breakfast table with her, her parents, Libby, and Angus seated, talking and eating. In narration, Georgia relates to us that she is now very happy with her life; she doesn't mind her parents enthusiastically snogging in front of her anymore, that she has great understanding friends, and that she doesn't mind not looking perfect â€” it's overrated. As she leaves the house to go to school, we see Robbie waiting for her. They lock hands, and as they step off to school, the scene changes to them on a date, walking along the boardwalk on a warm evening, enjoying each other.

In 1919 a village general meeting agreed to sell the two cottages into private ownership, as annual maintenance costs were making them uneconomic. During the Second World War several of the land plots, including the verges enclosing the West Keal to Keal Cotes footpath, were compulsorily annexed by the Air Ministry to form part of RAF East Kirkby which adjoined the village. Over the next twenty years all of the remaining plots, with the sole exception of the triangle field, were also sold. The combined sales produced a unified cash fund that is currently invested, with the annual interest income still distributed by the commissioners of "West Keal Parish Charity Fund" to deserving parishioners each Christmas.
From within the Duration, one may augment it to contain other Durations one can enter into.

The 135th was designated at the time as a "Psychological Warfare" unit which supported USAF unconventional warfare (guerrilla warfare), direct action (commando-type raids), strategic reconnaissance (intelligence gathering), and PSYWAR operations. The C-46 was supplemented by SA-16 Albatross amphibious aircraft beginning in 1956. The SA-16 (later redesignated HU-16) completely replaced the C-46s in late 1958. Training for water landings with the SA-16 was extremely hazardous. To make matters worse, doctrine required pilots to land their aircraft on water at night, with no landing lights. Night water landings were practiced at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in southern Maryland. Three crewmen were killed when their plane crashed while attempting a water landing in May 1956.
