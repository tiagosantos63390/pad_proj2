The district is significant for its architecture, which includes many examples of Victorian architecture with rich detailing. The buildings in the district also reflect the institutions and people responsible with the development of Danielson. The town's growth began in 1809, when brothers James and Hezekiah Danielson built a cotton spinning mill, and was further fueled by other textile mills, the completion of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad through town in 1830, the establishment of other businesses, and the expansion of the textile mills from the 1850s onward. The houses in the Broad Street-Davis Park area were built by middle and upper-class residents, who chose the latest architectural styles and built large houses. The area also was above the river terrace, providing fine views and flood protection.

The brief argued that the government's position and current practice subjects travelers to unconstitutional invasive searches of laptops and other devices. Their argument is similar to that already made by Arnold, and they contended mainly that a computer is different from a gas tank, suitcase, or other closed container because laptops routinely contain some of the most personal information about a person's life. Moreover, the amici were concerned that a search would reveal information that is already protected under other statutes, including privileged legal communications, reporters' notes from confidential sources, and trade secrets.
