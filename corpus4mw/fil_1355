Son of comedian/singer Harry Secombe (whom he later impersonated in a "Goon Show" special), the younger Secombe is probably best known for providing the voice of Watto in the "Star Wars" prequels.

In order to have an elected member, a constituency needed to be set up in an area with 1000 people. Others members were appointed. This created a patch-work of represented and unrepresented areas across the sprawling and sparse territory.

4 International Colleges & Universities (4ICU) has ranked Central 21st among 217 universities in the Philippines. 4icu actually is the official web portal of the International Colleges and Universities, an international higher education search engine and directory which reviews over 11,000 Colleges and Universities in 200 countries around the globe. Tertiary Education Schools should be duly recognized, licensed and accredited by national ministries of education or higher education accrediting organizations before they qualify and get listed to 4icu.org. Furthermore, the organization maintains and religiously updates the profiles of the schools included in their list to protect the quality of the information contained in its directory. 4icu Org University Web Ranking is a non-academic ranking body and thus it is not used to measure the academic standards of the organization. It aims however, to help international students know which University or College is popular in a specific country based on the popularity of their websites which be could use as reference in selecting a higher education organization to enroll from.
Before modern factoring algorithms, such as MPQS and NFS, were developed, it was thought to be useful to select Blum integers as RSA moduli. This is no longer regarded as a useful precaution, since MPQS and NFS are able to factor Blum integers with the same ease as RSA moduli constructed from randomly selected primes.

The 1914 Simla Accord defined the McMahon Line as the new boundary between British India and Tibet. By this treaty Tibet relinquished several hundred square miles of its territory, including Tawang, to the British, but it was not recognised by China. However, the British did not take possession of Tawang and Tibet continued to administer and collect taxes in Tawang. When the British botanist Frank Kingdon-Ward crossed the Sela Pass and entered Tawang in 1935 without permission from Tibet, he was briefly arrested. This drew the attention of the British, who reexamined the Indo-Tibetan border and rediscovered that Tibet had ceded Tawang to British India. Tibet did not repudiate the Simla Accord and the McMahon Line but refused to surrender Tawang, partly because of the importance attached to the Tawang Monastery. In 1938 the British made a cautious move to assert sovereignty over Tawang by sending a small military column under Capt. G.S. Lightfoot to Tawang.

Modern conspiracy theorists, such as Nesta Webster and William Guy Carr, believe the methods of the Illuminati as described in "Proofs of a Conspiracy" were copied by radical groups throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in their subversion of benign organizations. Spiritual Counterfeits Project editor Tal Brooke has compared the views of "Proofs of a Conspiracy" with those found in Carroll Quigley's "Tragedy and Hope" (Macmillan, 1966). Brooke suggests that the New World Order, which Robison believed Adam Weishaupt (founder of the Illuminati) had in part accomplished through the infiltration of Freemasonry, will now be completed by those holding sway over the international banking system (e.g., by means of the Rothschilds' banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank).

When Karadoc touches an object, he can push it around, unless it is too heavy (a potion of strength allows pushing heavier objects). Touching an object also causes the context menu to be enabled. When the context menu is enabled, the fire button is used to select an action from the menu instead of jumping. The possible actions depend on the type of object, and are represented with icons. They include things like "investigate", "pull", "pick up", "drink", "open", "insert", "give" and some others. Items which are picked up land in Karadocs inventory, and get additional actions, like "cast" for spells. One item at a time also can be readied, usually a weapon, which makes the fire button throw or use the readied item instead of jumping.
"One end of the candle was ignited by a Bunsen flame, the fat catching fire after about a minute. Although the Bunsen was removed at this point, combustion of the fat proceeded slowly along the length of the roll, with a smoky yellow flame and much production of soot, the entire roll being consumed after about one hour."
