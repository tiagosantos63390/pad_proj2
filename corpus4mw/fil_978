Adelpha is a world that is parallel to our own, and it is here that the action of Outcast takes place. The main population are the Talan, basically the parallel version of human beings. Their technology seems very primitive compared to our own; one could say theirs is roughly equivalent to what would have been found in ancient China or medieval Europe. However, their energy-based weapons and intercontinental portals suggest that at one point they were much more advanced. Adelpha is broken up into several regions, which are hinted to be separated by large water masses. Transport between regions is ensured by gates known as Daokas, which allows its users to instantaneously teleport from one region to another.

In his message to the faithful of the Diocese for that occasion, Patriarch Alexei of Moscow and All Russia stressed that the Cathedral is home to a 'multitudinous and multilingual flock', and that this is quite proper for the Church, being 'a single body made up of many and dissimilar members, filled with one Spirit'. Alexei exhorted the members of the Diocese to 'bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ' (Gal. 6:2). He hoped that the celebrations would contribute to the 'healing' of the 'wounds' inflicted upon the Diocese in recent times.

Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from the Krusty Burger restaurant and names it "Spider Pig" (later "Harry Plopper", and finally "Plopper"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny (Shearer) calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free doughnuts, Homer in his impatience dumps the silo straight into the lake, rather than waiting in a traffic jam for the plant. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart discover the creature before the Environmental Protection Agency captures it. Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks), head of the EPA, presents five "unthinkable" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Shearer) to keep the town's pollution contained; Schwarzenegger "randomly" selected enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill them, but the family escape the town through a sinkhole, which destroys their house shortly afterwards. As the EPA searches for the escapees, Homer plans to flee to Alaska.
