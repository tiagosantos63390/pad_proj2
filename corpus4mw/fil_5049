The captured CTCs on the filter membrane of a ScreenCell isolation device, are transferred to a 24-well cell culture plate for enumeration/characterization using ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay. A target-specific probe set containing 20 oligonucleotide pairs hybridizes to the target RNA. An oligo pair hybridization event is essential for support of the signal amplification structure, which is assembled by a series of sequential hybridization steps. Each fully assembled amplification structure is contained within 40−50 bp of target RNA with the capacity for 400-fold signal amplification. Therefore, a typical target-specific probe set (containing 20 oligo pairs) can generate 8,000-fold signal amplification at the location of the target RNA.

15 February 1904 and 1 September 1904 saw the third and fourth stages of the line opened to Toogoolawah (via Ottaba) and Yimbun respectively. The already successful Cressbrook condensed milk factory operated in Toogoolawah and the advent of the railway boosted its development. When the first passenger arrived, there was confusion between Cressbrook station and Cressbrook railway station. The name Toogoolawah was chosen for the railway station after a local family’s home in Brisbane called "Tugulawa" meaning a "bend in the river". At its height, the railway complex included a goods shed, turntable, camping quarters, cattle yards, station master’s residence and pig pens. Yimbun (previously called Moorabool and later Kannangur) is only some 4  miles beyond Toogoolawah and three trains a week plied the line from Ipswich.

The Scheitholt was played similarly to the modern zither. It was placed horizontally on a table or on the player's lap, the left hand pressed the strings with a wooden stick sometimes called a 'noter', while the thumb and index finger plucked the strings either directly, or with a horn or wooden plectrum, or with a goose quill. Some strings functioned as drones.

Ron Solo and Marie Alexander went on to form Hector in Paris, a qpopular synthpop/new wave band, along with Philip Harris and Jim Laugelli. Max Haste (Joe O'Lear) was not only a singer but a gifted storyteller, and could frequently hold an unruly crowd's attention telling short stories and talking between songs, sometimes using props such as a box of oats or a "Pop-up Pirate" toy. He was studying medicine at the time, and always had a great disease-of-the-week story based on whatever he was studying at the time (and which he frequently thought he was coming down with). 
During the first few months that Francisco operated as El Gato Negro, he encountered Armando Ochoa, better known as the career-criminal "El Graduado". Son of the successful businessman and drug lord Ignacio Ochoa, an enemy Agustin had faced early in his career, El Graduado planned to take his father's place amongst a criminal organization known as the Annulus. After his attempts at a large drug-trafficking deal are consistently thwarted being foiled by El Gato Negro, a desperate El Graduado held Agustin hostage at his own produce company. After refusing El Graduado's offer to become a "silent partner" he is sentenced to death. Escaping the firing squad, Agustin managed to incapacitate his would-be executioners and allows Francisco enough time to subdue El Graduado.
John's narration returns to the stillness of heaven, the end of all earthly time, and tells that seven angels appear and are given trumpets. Each sounding signifies great sorrows upon the world and its people. The soloists announce the woes, building from alto through to quartet: a rain of blood and fire (punishment for the sins of mankind, responds the chorus); a glowing mountain appears in the sea, and all ships founder, and all lives are lost in the sea and the water is turned to blood (Response: Great God, your judgements are righteous); the star named Wormwood falls to earth, and poisons all waters, and whoever drinks it, dies (Response: Lord, your punishment is truly righteous); Woe to you, sun moon and stars are lost!, sings the quartet of solo voices. The fifth and sixth blasts and their woes are given entirely to the chorus: the plague of hosts devouring the people, and the armies of riders seeking out and slaying people.

The waka is linked to the Bay of Plenty region. Legend has it that the waka taken by the priest Ngātoroirangi back to Hawaiki.
