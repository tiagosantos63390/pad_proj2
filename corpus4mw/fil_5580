Frisking or a "patdown" is a search of a person's under garments wherein a police officer or other law enforcement agent runs his or her hands along the under garments to detect any bulges. In the case of "Terry v. Ohio", 392 U.S. 1 (1968), the Supreme Court of the United States held that police have the ability to do a limited search for weapons of areas within the suspectâ€™s control based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person stopped was "armed or dangerous" and had been, is, or was about to engage in a criminal act. The type of frisk authorized by this decision has become known as a "Terry stop". When stopping someone, the officer must have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity has been, is being, or is about to be committed.
