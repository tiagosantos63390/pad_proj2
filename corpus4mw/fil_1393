Later life.
Kristina, and Karl Oskar's parents, try to convince him that it is foolish to move. They would never be able to return and would never get to see family and friends again. They wouldn't speak the language and would end up completely isolated. But when Kristina makes christening porridge for the new baby, their starving oldest daughter (Anna) eats it all and dies as a result. Realising that the poverty in Sweden is just as dangerous as anything on the sea, Kristina agrees to move ("Come To Me Everyone"). They visit the provost and write down their reasons for emigrating in the church book. The provost tries to convince them to stay by telling them of all the horrors waiting in America, and by saying that God will wipe America off the face of the earth within fifty years. The emigrants don't care however, and begin their journey ("We Open Every Gate"). Karl Oskar, Kristina, their children and Robert have gained some companions on their journey. Danjel and his family are moving to escape the religious persecution. Ulrika and her daughter is moving with them, and so is Arvid, a friend of Robert's.

Biography.
2010
Around 1200 B.C. a serious crisis began for the terramare culture that within a few years led to the abandonment of all the settlements; the reasons for this crisis are still not entirely clear, it seems possible that in the face of an incipient overpopulation (between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals were calculated) and depletion of natural resources, a series of drought periods led to a deep economic crisis, famine, and consequently the disruption of the political order, which caused the collapse of society. Around 1150 B.C. the terramare were completely abandoned, with no settlements replacing them. The plains, especially in the area of Emilia, were abandoned for several centuries, and only in the Roman era they regain the density of population reached during the terramare period.
