Organization.

The team achieved their first home win in five matches after beating Exeter 2–1, with first half goals scored by McCombe and Coulson. Hayhurst's loan was extended to the end of the season, having impressed in his six appearances for the club. Coulson scored again with the only goal, a 41st minute header, in York's 1–0 away win over AFC Wimbledon. Bowman scored the only goal with a 32nd minute penalty as York won 1–0 away at Mansfield, in which Fletcher missed the opportunity to extend the lead when his stoppage time penalty was saved by Alan Marriott. York moved one place outside the play-offs with a 2–0 home win over Wycombe, courtesy of a second Bowman penalty in as many matches and a Carson goal from the edge of the penalty area. Coulson scored York's only goal in a 1–0 away win over struggling Portsmouth with a low volley in the fifth minute; this result meant York moved into the play-offs in seventh place with eight fixtures remaining.
