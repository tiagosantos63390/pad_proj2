Sources differ on the degree to which Irwin expressed concern as the India flight neared. Leasor quoted Elsie O'Neill, the widow of one of the passengers, to the effect that Irwin "kept on saying 'They're rushing us. We're not ready, we're just not ready'" when she and her husband visited the ship prior to the flight. Moreover, according to the airship historian Giles Camplin, it was "often said" that Irwin "considered stepping down" but was dissuaded from this by "the certain knowledge that others would step forward to take his place."
A family quarrel erupted in 1912 and a lawsuit split the company: Arnold retained the Place Vendôme venue and changed the name to Arnold Seligmann & Co. and Jacques moved his headquarters to the Palais de Sagan and opened a new space at 17 Place Vendôme. Shortly thereafter Jacques' Place Vendôme space moved to 9 Rue de la Paix and the New York office move to a larger space at 705 Fifth Avenue. As one family member left, another joined Jacques Seligmann & Co., Germain Seligman, Jacques' son (the second n being dropped from his name when he became an American citizen). Germain learned skills in customer service and sales, accompanying his father on purchase trips. In 1910 he went to St. Petersburg, Russia to investigate the selling of the Swenigorodskoi enamels. Germain left the gallery in 1914 to fight for the French army in World War I and returned to rejoin the family company as a partner in 1920. Upon his father's death in 1923, Germain became president of the company.
