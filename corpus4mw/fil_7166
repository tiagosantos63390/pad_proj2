In 1952, Weir was appointed Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army (newly formed from the New Zealand Military Forces as a result of the New Zealand Army Act 1950). This appointment was followed by a term as Chief of the General Staff (CGS) from 1955 to 1960. During this time he oversaw the abolition of compulsory military training, a government policy which he personally disagreed with but carried out to the best of his ability. He also worked to improve relations with the military of the United States. Formally adding Stephen as a forename by deed poll in 1960, he was knighted following the completion of his CGS term. He became a military consultant to the New Zealand government, working in the Prime Minister's Department and advising the Prime Minister, Walter Nash, on military matters affecting foreign affairs.

The candidacy of radical trade union organizer Eugene V. Debs for President of the United States in 1900 on the ticket of the Social Democratic Party of America inspired Titus and brought him to the next chapter of his diverse life story. After becoming the State Organizer of the Social Democratic Party of Washington in the summer of 1900, Titus launched Seattle's first explicitly socialist weekly newspaper on August 12 under the simple and direct title "The Socialist." A total of 500 tabloid-sized copies were printed at a cost of $13. The first editorial office of the publication was the basement of Social Democratic Party headquarters, located at 220 Union Street in Seattle.
