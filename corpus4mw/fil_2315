It was, however, the 2005–06 season that saw Johnson stake a claim for a regular first team spot. Johnson made around 30 appearances in total, and perhaps would have made more were it not for three suspensions (two following red cards, one following his fifth booking of the season). Johnson scored his first goal for Gillingham against Milton Keynes Dons on New Year's Eve 2005 in a 3–0 win at Priestfield when he headed home Andrew Crofts' flick on following Michael Flynn's long ball.

In late January and early February 1944, the "17th Panzer Division" took part in the relief operations for the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket, as part of the "III Panzer Corps". In the end, the involved German tank divisions were halted by the Red Army 12 km from the pocket but the troops inside managed to break through, abandoning their heavy equipment. It was then part of the "1st Panzer Armee" in the Kamenets-Podolsky Pocket, where it lost most of its own heavy equipment, but escaped as a whole. On this occasion, 200,000 German soldiers were trapped in a pocket due to Hitlers orders against strategic withdrawals. Erich von Manstein eventually convinced Hitler to let the army retreat but he was relieved from his command afterwards.

In women's athletics, 3000 metres was a standard event in the Olympic Games (1984 to 1992) and World Championships (1980 to 1993). The event was discontinued at World Championship and Olympic level after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics - Qu Yunxia being the final gold medal winner at the event. Starting with the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and the 1996 Olympic Games, it was replaced by 5000 metres, with other IAAF-organized championships following suit.
Unlike the Cubists, Mondrian still attempted to reconcile his painting with his spiritual pursuits; and, in 1913, he began to fuse his art and his theosophical studies into a theory that signaled his final break from representational painting. While Mondrian was visiting home in 1914, World War I began, forcing him to remain in The Netherlands for the duration of the conflict. During this period, he stayed at the Laren artist's colony, there meeting Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg, who were both undergoing their own personal journeys toward Abstraction. Van der Leck's use of only primary colors in his art greatly influenced Mondrian. After a meeting with Van der Leck in 1916, Mondrian wrote, "My technique which was more or less Cubist, and therefore more or less pictorial, came under the influence of his precise method." With Van Doesburg, Mondrian founded "De Stijl" ("The Style"), a journal of the De Stijl Group, in which he published his first essays defining his theory, for which he adopted the term Neoplasticism.

Numerous governments offered him medals for his actions in the war, but he refused them all. During and after his wartime service, Quiller became a specialist in understanding Nazi clandestine organizations and their activities, particularly the so-called "ratlines" used by Nazis to escape from justice. Most of the book takes place in 1965, by which time Quiller has been seconded by the Bureau to secretly provide large amounts of useful intelligence information to West Germany's main war crimes investigation agency, the Z Commission. Quiller is tired and wants to return home, but the Bureau persuades him to investigate the plans of a Nazi secret society. He agrees to do so in part because that secret society has just assassinated a friend and colleague whom he had deeply respected.
