Joseph Bensoua called it "slow-moving space junk... Its 81-minute length, economical (make that cheap) sets and talky script give it a texture that's more akin to a "Twilight Zone" episode -- only not as good." Rick Lyman, similarly, described the movie as "a lazy, whimsical sci-fier," while sympathizing with Max, "an outer-space Holden Caulfield - young, confused, yearning to get away from his strict surroundings and cut loose in the big city (in this case, the planet Earth). His performance is the best thing about the movie. His Max is hopelessly sweet and naïve, way too trusting for his own good. He's the only character in the movie exhibiting the least bit of compassion or tenderness."

Great frigatebirds will attempt kleptoparasitism, chasing other nesting seabirds (boobies and tropicbirds in particular) in order to make them regurgitate their food. This behaviour is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of the species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.

Increasing European settlement in Gippsland dispossessed the indigenous Kurnai people, who were progressively forced off their land to make was for pastoral activities. Relations between Europeans and the Kurnai reached their nadir in 1843 when McMillan's colleague Macalister was killed by an Aborigine. Historian Paul Bartrop states that McMillan retaliated by organising an armed assault on the Kurnai, including the massacre of between 60 and 150 indigenous Australians at Warrigal Creek.

Paine signed amateur forms with Southampton in August 1956 and then in February 1957, Saints signed Paine as a full-timer when he appeared in a reserve game against Bristol Rovers. The following month he made his League debut at home to Brentford, just a week before his 18th birthday. Paine did not score in the 3–3 draw but the crowd were impressed by his ball-juggling skills, pace and ability to use either foot. Paine's rise to stardom was meteoric and, following just one outing in the Reserves, he was given his first team debut. A week later, on his birthday, he scored in a 1–1 draw against Aldershot. By the end of his first season he had become a virtual regular, switching from left wing to right wing and over the next 17 years hardly missed a game.
