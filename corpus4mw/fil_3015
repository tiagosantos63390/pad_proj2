As a cricket commentator he was articulate and often drily humorous. On a Saturday afternoon sport programme, Neil Durden-Smith once mentioned that he had been having tea with the Bishop of Leicester. On being cued in, Gibson began his commentary stint with: "No episcopal visitations here." His cricket writing for "The Times" was generally light-hearted, often concentrating more on his journey to the match (invariably by train, often changing at Didcot, rarely straightforward) than on the cricket itself. On at least one occasion his day's report was published even though rain had prevented any cricket from taking place.

TBN took W26BS silent March 25, 2010 due to declining support, which has been attributed to the digital transition. W26BS returned to the air on April 26, 2010. On April 13, 2012, TBN sold 36 of its translators, including W26BS, to Regal Media, a broadcasting group headed by George Cooney, the CEO of the EUE/Screen Gems studios. In the meantime, W26BS left the air once more, on July 16, 2012, after losing the lease to its transmitter site; it will not return until after the sale to Regal Media is complete.
