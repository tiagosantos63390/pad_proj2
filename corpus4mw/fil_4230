STOIC was said at the time to be conceptually similar to FORTH in the use of an extensible vocabulary of words'. STOIC is actually a rational, and more consistent, dialect of FORTH. The system was remarkable at the time for having a built-in assembler, floating-point package, interrupt handler, and display editor (similar to the Nova display editor). The source, and documentation, was distributed for many years by the CP/M Users Group.

A portable version written in C was placed in the public domain and also distributed by the CP/M Users Group (UK).
