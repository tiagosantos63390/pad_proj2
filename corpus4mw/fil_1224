In quasi-Newton methods, the Hessian matrix of second derivatives doesn't need to be evaluated directly. Instead, the Hessian matrix is approximated using rank-one updates specified by gradient evaluations (or approximate gradient evaluations). Quasi-Newton methods are generalizations of the secant method to find the root of the first derivative for multidimensional problems. In multi-dimensional problems, the secant equation does not specify a unique solution, and quasi-Newton methods differ in how they constrain the solution. The BFGS method is one of the most popular members of this class. Also in common use is L-BFGS, which is a limited-memory version of BFGS that is particularly suited to problems with very large numbers of variables (e.g., >1000). The BFGS-B variant handles simple box constraints.
Gary Stephen Ross's best-selling nonfiction book "Stung" chronicles Molony's 18 months of increasingly brazen fraud and out-of-control gambling. The movie "Owning Mahowny" was based on Ross's book. Philip Seymour Hoffman played "Dan Mahowny", the character based on Molony.

The plurals of "test" and "desk" may become "tesses" and "desses" by the same English rule that gives us plural "messes" from singular "mess".

2011â€“2013: Spark.
Leaf extracts of "Hydrangea macrophylla" are being investigated as a possible source of new chemical compounds with antimalarial activity. Hydrangeic acid from the leaves is being investigated as a possible anti-diabetic drug as it significantly lowered blood glucose, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels in laboratory animals.
