Produced by David Arnold and Danny Cannon, the song was originally a non-album track recorded for the film "The Young Americans" and intended as a single-only release, but eventually it was added as a bonus track to international pressings of Björk's album "Debut" because Björk's manager Derek Birkett convinced her to add the track. Björk also sings on the tracks "Opening Titles" and "Leaving London" on the soundtrack CD of the film. In both the film and soundtrack, "Leaving London" crescendoes into "Play Dead" as a single arrangement. In both the album and the single version, the song is actually a remix by Tim Simenon. After the addition of "Play Dead" on "Debut", about 100 people who already owned the album without the bonus track, called the record company and complained, demanding to be given new records as compensation.
