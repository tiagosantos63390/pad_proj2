DJ Kristian then coined the phrase "Hard NRG" while Jon Bell (Captain Tinrib/Dr. Base/Fierce Base), John Newell (RR Fierce/Rim 'N Chop/Fierce Base), Karim Lamouri (Karim/Rim 'N Chop) Chris Payne (Casper) & Barmak Hatamian (The Alien Thing/Max & Amino) were instrumental in the development of Hard NRG.

In July 2009 Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm issued Executive Order 2009-36 which in part directed that "Michigan History" magazine be transferred to a non-profit, society or foundation. On October 1, 2009 the magazine moved to the Historical Society of Michigan, a non-governmental non-profit and the same organization that had been involved in producing the publication from its founding through 1948. The Society then established the subsidiary Michigan History Magazine L3C. Former editorial staff did not move with the magazine. New staff was announced in October 2009 and named Patricia Majher Editor. Historical Society of Michigan Executive Director Larry J. Wagenaar serves as the magazine's Publisher.
