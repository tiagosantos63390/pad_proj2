In the United States, the surname was redefined by "Stacia Falat" and "Dominic Volonnino", both who took on the Kiraly surname at their wedding on July 9, 2011. The name was an amalgamation of Gaelic words that represent virtues important to the couple. They chose two virtues: kindness and social justice. Kiraly is not inherently an Irish last name. However, since both Stacia and Dominic are Irish, they sought Gaelic translations for these two virtues.
