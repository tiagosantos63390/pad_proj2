Another dancer, David Allan, experienced very negative effects of the stereotype growing up. He tells of the time he performed in his school’s talent show at age eleven, “I was so excited about doing "A Dance from David", my first choreography. So, when I came out in my pretty white tights, there was a big roar of laughter... Later I met some guys in the hallway of my school who were making rude comments ... 'You’re that dancer guy' would turn into being thrown down the stairs."

Following her retirement from racing, Glad Rags was sent to the United States (where she was known as Glad Rags II) to serve as a broodmare. She produced eleven foals by stallions including Alydar, Buckpasser, Hoist The Flag, Native Dancer, Nijinsky, Raise a Native, Sir Ivor. The best of her progeny (both sired by Nijinsky) were the colt Gorytus who won the Champagne Stakes and the filly Terpsichorist whose wins included the Grade II Sheepshead Bay Stakes. Her modern descendants include Terpsichorist's grandson Union Rags, the winner of the 2012 Belmont Stakes, and Declaration of War, winner of the Queen Anne Stakes and International Stakes in 2013.
