In the background, the band used images of large pockets of poverty on beaches around the world—the slums of Alagados in Salvador, Trenchtown in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica and at Maré in Rio—to show the contrast between the cities' joy (these three cities were synonymous with the party) and sadness (mostly situated in its poor residents in the slums). The first stanza is about the people who live in poor living conditions in the dawn of the day, a great challenge since daybreak took away night's fantasy world (dreams) for the day's harsh realities] exemplified by stilts, warehouses and rags. The second stanza addresses the insensitivity of the authorities.

The 1971 selection process for the Belgian Eurovision entry had resulted in a comprehensive victory for the song "Goeiemorgen, morgen" ("Good Morning, Morning"), performed by Nicole & Hugo, to be the representative for the 16th Eurovision Song Contest, to take place on 3 April in Dublin. Less than a week before the contest however, Nicole fell ill with jaundice and the duo had to withdraw. As last-minute replacements, VRT drafted in Castel and Belgium's 1963 Eurovision veteran Jacques Raymond. It was a race against time for the pair, not least when they arrived in Dublin to find that the stage layout at the Gaiety Theatre was unsuitable for the routine they had rehearsed. In the circumstances they gave a creditable performance on the night, but "Goeiemorgen, morgen" was not greatly appreciated by the juries and finished in joint 14th place of 18 entries.

In a break with American Idol tradition, Allen's Idol "coronation song", "No Boundaries", was not included on his major-label debut, becoming only the second Idol winner album to do so after Taylor Hicks' self-titled album. Instead, a newly recorded version of "Heartless", covered by Allen during his run on Idol, was included as a bonus track. There has been speculation that this was because "No Boundaries" was already included on the Walmart exclusive season 8 compilation album, which is the first time the winning single was included on the season's compilation since Kelly Clarkson in 2002 and is the first new compilation since season five. However, it has been included as part of the deluxe album version at iTunes.
