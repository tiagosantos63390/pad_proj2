DeVille recorded two albums for Atlantic, 1981's "Coup de Grâce" (produced by Jack Nitzsche) and 1983’s "Where Angels Fear to Tread." Both albums featured saxophonist Louis Cortelezzi and had a full-throated Jersey Shore sound that evoked Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny. Wrote critic Thom Jurek about these albums:(Both) are truly solid albums—despite lukewarm reviews at the time—showcasing much of Willy’s theatrical personality and his own desire to provide for the elements of fantasy in rock music that the early rockers and doo-woppers did in the 1950s and 1960s (and that Piaf and Brel did in France). Rootsy, hook-laden rock, iconic balladry, and the theater of aural experience were all contained in songs that offered the illusion that one could still find acted out under a streetlamp-lit stage, in front of a trashcan bonfire, narrated by one costumed in the decadent attire of a Euro-trash lothario-cum-stiletto-carrying 1950s gang banger... They captivate a listener in the same way a great period film would—they tell an epic story in a few minutes and capture all of its life and death drama.
It was another success like the band's 1996 self-titled debut, "Placebo", and peaked at number seven in the UK Albums Chart and at number 20 on the US "Billboard" Heatseekers Albums chart. "Without You I'm Nothing" went platinum in the UK and gold in France and has sold over one million copies to date. The album has also spawned five singles including very notable songs for the band "Pure Morning" and "You Don't Care About Us".

The Owls were promoted to the Second Division a year later, but Sterland was still very much a fringe player, making just two league appearances. However, he emerged as a regular player in 1980-81, when still only 19 years old, playing 22 league games and scoring once in the Second Division.

Seeing that the railway connection at "Brixham Road" was close, but inconvenient, a local solicitor and proprietor of the fishing harbour, Richard Walter Wolston, set about obtaining support for a line connecting Brixham itself. Largely by his efforts, the "Torbay and Brixham Railway Company" was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 25 July 1864 or 26 July 1864; together with a tramway in connection with the railway. The Company's share capital was £18,000 and Wolston himself subscribed £17,700. The contractor defaulted during construction, but largely due to Wolston's personal and financial resources, it was completed, and opened on 28 February 1868 to passengers, goods traffic being handled from 1 May 1868. The line was 2m 6c (3.3 km) in length.
