Garp spends time visiting his mother and the people who live at her center, including transsexual ex-football player Roberta Muldoon. He also first hears the story of Ellen James, a girl who was gang raped and then had her tongue cut out so that she could not identify her attackers. Some of the women at Jenny's center are "Ellen Jamesians", women who voluntarily cut out their own tongues as a show of solidarity. Garp is horrified by the practice and learns that the Jamesians have received a letter from Ellen James begging them to stop the practice, but that they have voted to refuse.
While they are expensive pieces of equipment, their popularity and adoption by firefighters in the United States is increasing markedly due to the increased availability of government equipment grants following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

The final saw the legendary Phil Taylor face one of darts' rising young stars, 23-year-old James Wade in his first major final. Wade started the brighter, breaking Taylor's throw early on to take an early 4-1 lead in the race to 18. In those five legs he hit two 100 finishes. The next few legs all went to who threw first in that leg before "The Power" broke back to lead 10-9. Since then, Taylor was always in control, taking eight of the next eleven legs, including a 140 finish, to claim an 18-11 victory and his eighth World Matchplay title.

When his father died at a young age, as the second elder male child in the family, the burden of supporting the big family fell upon W.S. He was not deterred by the hardships. W.S. was even more determined to complete his studies and come out of the poverty that plagued the family. While working part-time, he managed to fill the void left behind by his father by being the father figure to his younger siblings. He managed to feed the entire family and keep all in school while winning accolades from his teachers for his brilliant analytical mind and academic work. Along the way, he won numerous scholarships and obtained the Bachelor of Arts first class honours degree in 1952. His father wanted W.S. to join the Ceylon Civil Service which would have brought prestige and honour to the family. However, his professors persuaded him to join the faculty at the University of Peradeniya as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Pali and Buddhist Civilization. In 1954, W.S. married his own student Indumathi Gunatillake who eventually became an expert in Tibetan Buddhism and joined the Sri Lanka Encyclopedia of Buddhism as an assistant editor where Dr.G.P. Malalasekera, the Chief Editor was her mentor. Soon after their wedding, W.S. and Indumathi left to London, England where W.S. obtained his doctorate from the University of London for his thesis on "The Theory of Causality in Early Buddhism" at the comparatively young age of twenty-eight. In the same year, W.S. was chosen as the F. L. Woodward prizeman of the School of Oriental and African Studies.

The pruning practices of coppicing and pollarding induce ramification by removing most of a tree's mass above the root. Fruit tree pruning increases the yield of orchards by inducing ramification and thereby creating many vigorous, fruitful branches in the place of a few less-fruitful ones.

The portion of modern NY 276 east of the Canadian border crossing in the town of Champlain was originally designated as part of Route 22, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. It did not receive a signed designation until when the entirety of what is now NY 276 became part of NY 348, which continued south from the current west end of NY 276 to the Chazy hamlet of West Chazy via modern US 11, US 9, and County Route 24. NY 348 was truncated southward to the hamlet of Chazy , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US 9. The former alignment of NY 348 north of US 11 was renumbered to NY 276.

Plack comes from a family of classical musicians. He studied classical violin, piano, guitar, and voice from a young age. He also enjoyed the improvisations on his father's jazz records and eventually turned toward the Australian landscape for inspiration. Plack picked up the didgeridoo in the early 1990s and immediately started his recording career with Johnny "White Ant" Soames, after being inspired by hearing a world beat song by Peter Gabriel and Youssou N'Dour. He has also collaborated with David Gulpilil and other Aboriginal musicians of Arnhem Land, Northern Territory.

The biosynthesis of Trabectedin in "Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis" starts with a fatty acid loading onto the acyl-ligase domain of the EtuA3 module. A cysteine and glycine are then loaded as canonical NRPS amino acids. A tyrosine residue is modified by the enzymes EtuH, EtuM1, and EtuM2 to add a hydroxyl at the meta position of the phenol, and adding two methyl groups at the para-hydroxyl and the meta carbon position. This modified tyrosine reacts with the original substrate via a Pictet-Spangler reaction, where the amine group is converted to an imine by deprotonation, then attacks the free aldehyde to form a carbocation that is quenched by electrons from the methyl-phenol ring. This is done in the EtuA2 T-domain. This reaction is done a second time to yeid a dimer of modified tyrosine residues that have been further cyclized via Pictet-spangler reaction, yielding a bicyclic ring moiety. The EtuO and EtuF3 enzymes continue to post-translationally modify the molecule, adding several functional groups and making a sulfide bridge between the original cysteine residue and the beta-carbon of the first tyrosine to form ET-583, ET-597, ET-596, and ET-594 which have been previously isolated. A third o-methylated tyrosine is added and cyclized via Pictet-Spangler to yield the final product.

Further Chronicles of Avonlea is a collection of short stories by L. M. Montgomery and is a sequel to "Chronicles of Avonlea". Published in 1920, it includes a number of stories relating to the inhabitants of the fictional Canadian village of Avonlea and its region, located on Prince Edward Island. Sometimes marketed as a book in the Anne Shirley series, Anne plays only a minor role in the book: out of the 15 stories in the collection, she narrates and stars in only one ("The Little Brown Book of Miss Emily"), and is briefly mentioned in passing in two others ("Aunt Cynthia's Persian Cat" and "The Return of Hester").
