After graduating from Prospect Park High in 1943, Showell joined the U.S. Army. During his time in the Army, he attended flight school where he became a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black Army Air Corps pilots during World War II. Showell first experienced significant racial discrimination when he joined the military, where he and his fellow airmen were rarely called into action because of the color of their skin. Showell was discharged from the U.S. Army in October 1945.

Early on March 7, 2014, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Nadi (RSMC Nadi) reported that Tropical Disturbance 18F had developed about to the west of Nadi. The system was located within a marginally favorable environment for further development, which included low to moderate vertical wind shear and favorable sea surface temperatures. Over the next two days the system moved towards the north-northwest and slowly consolidated, as atmospheric convection wrapped into the system's low level circulation center, before RSMC Nadi reported during March 9 that the system had developed into a tropical depression. During that day the system further consolidated as it affected Vanuatu and moved towards the north-northeast, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated warnings and designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 18P later that day. RSMC Nadi subsequently named the system Lusi at around 23:00 UTC (11:00 FST), after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.
After mating, a female usually chooses a cavity as its nesting site. If the entrance is too large, a mud wall may first be built in which a hole about in diameter is made. The mud is gathered in small balls by the mandibles, transferred progressively to the fore, mid and hind legs, and deposited in the pollen basket on the hind leg. About six balls make a load, three in each basket and the female flies back to the nest site. Inside the cavity, a pedicel is constructed on which an urn-shaped cell is built. The mud of which it is made hardens as it dries. The outside of the cell is usually covered by a thin layer of faeces brought in by the female and the inside is lined with resin which is drawn up to form a flexible collar at the top. Each brood cell is provisioned with a cream-coloured mass made from a mixture of pollen and nectar, tamped down and filling two thirds of the cell. On about the fourth day after the construction was started, an egg is laid in the cell and the female folds in the collar and caps the cell with mud. The pedicel is extended and further cells are built against the long wall of the first giving a group of neatly arranged cells. The construction and provisioning of the later cells occupies less time.

Fisher began her bid at completing the Seven Summits challenge in January 2003, with Aconcagua in Argentina, followed in July by Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and Mount Elbrus in Russia. In 2004, she climbed Mount Kosciuszko in Australia in January, and Mount McKinley in May. She climbed her penultimate peak of the Seven Summits, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, in January 2005. In June 2005, Fisher successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, making her at 20 years old the youngest American to have done so at the time. Her ascent of Everest marked her completion of the Seven Summits; she became the youngest person ever to have completed the challenge. Most of Fisher's Seven Summit climbs were made with expeditions run by Alpine Ascents, a Seattle-based guiding company, costing a total of US$96,000.
