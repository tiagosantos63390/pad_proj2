In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1548.
Darden was a member of the Standards of Official Conduct committee, elected in 1991, and served on the Committee on Armed Services and Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. He opposed federal funding for Medicaid abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the mother. He supported the death penalty. Darden advocated maintaining a strong defense in spite of improved East-West relations. He said any money saved from a "peace dividend" should go to deficit reduction. In 1992, the Americans for Democratic Action gave Darden's 1991 voting record 40 points out of 100; the American Conservative Union gave him 35 points.

Tweek's family. Tweek's parents run a coffee shop called Tweek Bros. Coffee (a parody of Dunn Bros Coffee). It was nearly put out of business by the major coffee corporation, Harbucks. After a large feud both businesses learned to work together. The Tweeks are their own product's most devoted fans. Even their son consumes several cups of coffee a day (despite his age), hence his constant twitching and general nervousness. They usually have heart-to-heart talks with their son in times of concern or crisis (such as child abduction or their company going out of business), but unfortunately they often oversimplify or overexaggerate the problems making Tweek's paranoia worse - generally speaking, every time Tweek has a new concern or problem his parents tend to aggravate it. Richard Tweak wears a maroon jumper which is his shirt for work (hence the name tag on it) and black trousers. He has a long pointed nose and dark curly brown hair. Mrs. Tweak, whose first name has not been revealed on the show, wears a blue dress with a white apron, and long light brown hair.

Beitzel is also credited with pioneering the development of the composite rules sport International rules football. He drew inspiration from watching the 1966 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final on television, and in 1967 sent an Australian side – "The Galahs" – to play the game against an Irish side. Beitzel followed this up the next year with The Australian Football World Tour, a six-match series with games played against Irish teams in Ireland, the UK and United States. (The 1968 Galahs also played exhibition matches of Australian Rules throughout the tour, including a game in Bucharest, Romania.)

Not long after the 2003-04 season started, Bonzi Wells launched a tirade at Cheeks during practice ; he was suspended and soon traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Wesley Person and a first round pick. Soon after that, Rasheed Wallace gave an extended interview in which he claimed that the NBA exploited African American players. This interview was widely denounced by the team, the media, and the league, but no official punishment resulted.
