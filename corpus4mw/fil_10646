"Butter on the Latch" received a mostly positive response from critics. Eric Kohn of "Indiewire" praised the film, commenting that Decker "...never tries to impose a conventional narrative structure on the proceedings, and the ambiguities develop their own bizarrely compelling rhythm" and that her career is "one to keep an eye on." Peter Debruge of "Variety" noted that "... Decker has fashioned the kind of feature debut the film industry simply doesn’t support, but would do well to encourage: a visually poetic, virtually free-form groove in which emotion, rather than narrative, guides viewers through a young woman’s visit to a Balkan folk music camp."
Powell–Trollinger Lime Kilns is a set of three historic lime kilns located at Catawba, Catawba County, North Carolina. They were built about 1865, and are built into the side of a hill behind a solid stone wall, 20 to 30 feet high. The kilns were located at the top through rock-lined, circular openings. The kilns operated into the 20th century.

Records of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat are predominantly individuals captured in mist nets or harp traps in riparian habitats on ephemeral streams, floodways, pools or dams, usually at sites supporting large fringing eucalypts. Capture sites are consistently associated with riparian and floodplain habitats that support canopy eucalypts including "Eucalyptus camaldulensis", "Eucalyptus coolabah", "Eucalyptus microtheca", "Eucalyptus populnea", "Eucalyptus polyanthemos" and "Eucalyptus citriodora". At Gundabooka National Park in western NSW the bristle-faced free-tailed bat was only trapped along drainage lines with fringing "Eucalyptus camaldulensis" and "Eucalyptus populnea". During radio tracking studies at the Gundabooka site bristle-faced free-tailed bats were observed to preferentially forage along drainage lines and open channels, rarely moving into adjacent mulga vegetation, and all roost sites identified were in tall eucalypts within or adjacent to riparian zones.
