Kastler shares the conviction that the Sunday needs to be protected as work-free day of family and rest in order that children do not run the risk of suffering most from today's flexibilisation of our business world anymore. The key to a successful protection of children is giving parents time for their children. Thus, the introduction of a work-free Sunday contributes to turning Europe into the world's most child-oriented area. Besides, Kastler hints at the historical entrenchment of the work-free Sunday in the European social welfare net as well as at the proven advantages of a free weekday on health.
