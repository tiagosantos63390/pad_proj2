The Huggetts is a series of three British films released in the late 1940s, released by Gainsborough Pictures, centering around the character of Joe Huggett played by veteran actor Jack Warner, the head of a working class London family. Along with the Gainsborough melodramas the Huggetts were popular, lucrative films for the studio.
Frederick Ayres (born 17 March 1876; died 23 Nov 1926) was an American composer. Born in Binghamton, New York, he studied at Cornell University; further study, this time in music, came with Edgar Stillman Kelley and Arthur Foote. Ayres lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado for many years, during which time he became a "musical spokesman" for the Rocky Mountain area; he died there in 1926. Among his compositions were an overture, "From the Plains"; a string quartet and some other pieces of chamber music, and some songs.

Despite now being based in Wales, Hood ensured that his businesses in Scotland continued to grow. In 1890 he arranged for the amalgamation of his Whitehall colliery in Midlothian with the Newbattle pits owned by Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian. The resulting company was known as Lothian Coal Company. Around this time his son, James Hood (1859–1941), became general manager of the Lothian Coal Company, moving back to Scotland.
He was born on 1 November 1911. His parents married in January 1911. His father was Georg von Trapp and his mother was Agatha (née Whitehead) von Trapp (1891–1922). He grew up in Zell am See during World War I with his siblings, Agathe von Trapp (1913–2010), Maria Franziska von Trapp (1914-2014), Werner von Trapp (1915–2007), Hedwig von Trapp (1917–1972), and Johanna von Trapp (1919–1994). The youngest sister, Martina von Trapp (1921–1951), was born in Klosterneuburg (Austria), whither the Trapp Family had moved from Zell-am-See because their home (a "lake hotel" called "Kitzsteinhorn") had been flooded. In 1922, von Trapp's mother died of scarlet fever and was buried in Klosterneuburg when Rupert was almost 11 years old. In 1925, the family moved to Salzburg-Aigen. Rupert entered a public school, together with Werner; his sisters went to the Ursuline covent. 
Today, the neighborhood has plenty of wild life, seafood restaurants, inns and historical sites.

According to "The Tibetan Buddhist Resource Centre", disciples of Kenpo Munsel and Kenpo Jamyang at Katok Monastery in 1999 compiled a Katok edition of the "Kama" (Wylie: bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa (kaH thog)) in 120 volumes: "... twice the size of the Dudjom edition, it contains many rare Nyingma treatises on Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga that heretofore had never been seen outside of Tibet."
In February 2001, the Columbus Crew selected Tennyson in the 4th round (39th overall) in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Tennyson did not sign with Columbus, but moved to Europe where he trained with teams in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. On September 5, 2001, he signed with GIF Sundsvall becoming the first African-American from UCLA to play professional soccer in the Swedish Allsvenskan. On August 17, 2001, the Crew traded the rights to Tennyson to the Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a 2002 conditional draft pick. In 2002, Tennyson signed with the Portland Timbers of the USL First Division. That season, Tennyson led the Timbers in scoring with 18 goals and 6 assists in 24 games. This was good enough to lead the USL First Division in points and tied him with Fadi Afash and Eduardo Sebrango as joint goals leader. Tennyson was named to the USL All-Star First Team and earned other league awards. On August 15, 2002, following his successful rookie season, Tennyson signed as a developmental player with the Los Angeles Galaxy. On October 2, 2002, he entered his first game with Galaxy and in Major League Soccer, a playoff game against the Kansas City Wizards. He scored 31 seconds later. Tennyson's fortune continued and the Galaxy went on to win the 2002 MLS Soccer Championship beating the New England Revolution in the final. After unsuccessful negoiations with the Galaxy, Tennyson returned to Portland Timbers for the 2003 USL season. In 2003, his production dropped due to a painful hip injury, which required surgery in the offseason. However, Tennyson still finished with 11 goals and 3 assists in 28 games. In 2004, Tennyson signed a two year contract with the Timbers. Unfortunately, Tennyson could not honor the contract and was forced to retire because of the hip surgery and unsuccessful rehabilitation program. McKinley consulted hip specialist at Santa Monica Orthopaedic & Sports Medicine Group and Orthopaedic Medical Group of San Diego to make his final decision.

Maini resides in the southern foothills of 2225 meters high Mahābaṇ Range of mountains while Ajumair hill lies in its west and the barren Gadoon hills are lying in its east which blocks the water of Tarbela Dam. All these mountains are Piedmont zones and a tentative division between lesser Himalayas and the Hindu-Kush (Dani 2001: 13).

Query languages that are equivalent in expressive power to relational algebra were called relationally complete by Codd. By Codd's Theorem, this includes relational calculus. Relational completeness clearly does not imply that any interesting database query can be expressed in relationally complete languages. Well-known examples of inexpressible queries include simple aggregations (counting tuples, or summing up values occurring in tuples, which are operations expressible in SQL but not in relational algebra) and computing the transitive closure of a graph given by its binary edge relation (see also expressive power). Codd's theorem also doesn't consider SQL nulls and the three-valued logic they entail; the logical treatment of nulls remains mired in controversy. (For recent work extending Codd's theorem in this direction see the 2012 paper of Franconi and Tessaris.) Additionally, SQL allows duplicate rows (has multiset semantics.) Nevertheless, relational completeness constitutes an important yardstick by which the expressive power of query languages can be compared.
