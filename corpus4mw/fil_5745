"Look What's Back" (1990).

After the Roman Empire closed down the mint in Tyre, the Roman authorities allowed the Jewish rabbanim to continue minting Tyrian shekels in Israel, but with the requirement that the coins should continue to bear the same image and text to avoid objections that the Jews were given autonomy. They were replaced by First Jewish Revolt coinage in 66 AD.
Bugs Bunny's personality continued to evolve over the years, from a largely "screwball" character (a la Daffy Duck), to a mixture of "screwball" and "everyman" characteristics. His definitive design was created in 1943 by Bob Clampett, and would be adopted by each unit slowly (though Chuck Jones had a slight variation). Bugs' look was slightly modified again for the 2011 series "The Looney Tunes Show".
