The school is sited on the grounds of what was formerly Cannington Senior High School, which was built in 1965 and existed until 2000. The decision was made to close Cannington and open two new schools—Cannington Community College (K-10) and Sevenoaks Senior College (Years 11 and 12). Sevenoaks cost A$8.6 million to build, and was formally opened on 19 September 2001 by Minister for Education Alan Carpenter, although it had been operating since the beginning of 2001. Students from Yule Brook College who continue to study after leaving Year 10 will attend Sevenoaks.
