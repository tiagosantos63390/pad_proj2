Prior to 1992, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) were relatively uncommon in the US. According to data from the National Nosocomial Infection Service, between the years 1986 and 1990, only 2.3% of 1825 Enterobacter isolates sampled were found to be resistant. In recent years, however, CRE has become increasingly common. The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program noted that resistance within "Klebsiella pnuemoniae" alone increased from 0.6% in 2004 to 5.6% in 2008. The first outbreak involving colistin-resistant carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) in the U.S. was discovered in Detroit, MI in 2009, involving three different healthcare institutions. The increases in Carbapenem resistance for bacteria in general have not been limited to the US. In a study based in hospitals in Thailand, of 261 multidrug-resistant samples collected of "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" (NOT part of Enterobacteriaceae), 71.65% of them were carbapenem-resistant.

For the next two years he acted as chief clerk responsible for stores. Pichon served as scribe to the commandants. Pichon also helped Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre with his writing, although Pichon's suspicions about Roman Catholicism were confirmed by the missionary and he came to despise the priest.
