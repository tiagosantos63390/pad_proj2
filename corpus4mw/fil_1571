The son of an artisan, he studied law at Toulouse and became a solicitor's clerk in Paris. Cladel made a reputation in a limited circle by his first book, "Les Martyrs ridicules" (1862), a novel for which Charles Baudelaire, whose literary disciple Cladel was, wrote a preface. He then returned to his native district of Quercy, where he produced a series of pictures of peasant life in "Eral le dompteur" (1865),"Le Nomm Qouael" (1868) and other volumes, similar to the works of Émile Pouvillon. Returning to Paris he published the two novels which are generally acknowledged as his best work, "Le Bouscassie" (1869) and "La Fete votive de Saint Bartholome Porte-Glaive" (1872). "Une Maudite" (1876) was judged dangerous to the public morals and cost its author a month's imprisonment. Other works by Cladel are "Les Va-nu-pieds" (1873), a volume of short stories; "N'a-qu'un-oeil" (1882), "Urbains et ruraux" (1884), "Gueux de marque" (1887), and the posthumous "Juive errante" (1897). He died at Sèvres on July 21, 1892.

Under Francisco Franco's rule Spain was officially neutral in World War II, and like the rest of the country, Seville remained largely economically and culturally isolated from the outside world. One of the most significant events of this period occurred on 13 March 1941 with the explosion of the gunpowder stored in the magazine of Santa Barbara, located in the "Cerro del Aguila" (Eagle Hill), destroying ten surrounding blocks and damaging many more. Calle José Arpa, where the depot was located, was destroyed, as well as the streets Huesca, Galicia, Lisbon, Afan de Ribera and part of Héroes de Toledo. The magazine was not a military facility, but belonged to the "Sociedad Española de Explosivos" (Spanish Society of Explosives).
