Goatlord's received a recording contract with Turbo Records and with their remaining members, began to work on their first full-length record without Ace. They had hired Mitch Harris of Napalm Death as their replacement vocalist. The entire album was recorded with Mitch as the vocalist and only a few last-minute adjustments needed to be compiled before mastering. At this time Ace returned and asked to rejoin the fledgling band. The remaining members conceded and briefly re-united. It was unknown to the band that when Ace laid down his vocal tracks for the album, he recorded over Mitch's vocal tracks, destroying them. There weren't any other versions of Mitch's vocals and those tracks are lost forever. While Mitch's vocals did not appear on that album his contributions to back-up vocals did make it on the "Reflections of the Solstice" album.
