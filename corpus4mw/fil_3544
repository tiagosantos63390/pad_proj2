In December 1946, after the setback of the failed attempts to take Easy County (Yi Xian, 易县) and Full City (Man Cheng, 满城) regions, the nationalists redeployed their forces along the railroad from Beijing to Baoding to fragment the enemy base into smaller pieces. However, when carrying out the new strategy, the nationalist force was overstretched and the region between Wangdu (望都) and Zhengding to the south of Baoding was thinly manned: the vast area of over 200 km stretch of land was only guarded by a detachment of the 32nd Division of the nationalist 3rd Army and four regiments of the nationalist 5th Security Division totaling 20,000 troops.

Doug Bingham said, "It's just a building, but a building is a place where people are invested in each other's lives, and this one is toast." The Granite District has accepted a 15.9 million dollar settlement to rebuild Wasatch. The proposed time for the full reconstruction of the building was fall of 2008.
