Denzel Quincy Crocker, a.k.a. Mr. Crocker (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui), is a gray skinned, hunchbacked man (with ears on his neck). He is Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher. At the beginning of the series Crocker is notably more fair and less fairy obsessed. He correctly suspects that Timmy has fairy godparents of his own, and he is often able to tell what Timmy has wished for by the smallest, most irrelevant clues. His unshakable belief in fairy godparents leads to his being viewed as mentally ill by other adults. Whenever he mentions fairies, (mostly shouting, "This must be the work of... fairy godparents!") he spasms uncontrollably. Crocker enjoys tormenting and failing Timmy; indeed, in "Dad Overboard," when Timmy goes on vacation, Crocker becomes thoroughly depressed and openly states that his life has lost all meaning without Timmy around to humiliate. He was initially the secondary antagonist in the series, becoming the main antagonist in time, and also one of the main antagonists of .

Anura Punchi Banda Tennekoon was born on 29 October 1949 in Anuradhapura. At the age of six, he moved to Colombo, and was admitted to S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Staying at the school hostel, Tennekoon was soon accustomed with cricket, and became part of the school cricket team. He eventually went on to captain the Thomian cricket team, and was chosen as Sri Lanka's best schoolboy batsman in 1964. He had had the best batting average of 56.84 in the previous season, having scored a total of 513 runs. He played his first first-class match for Ceylon against an English side in 1966, and was later picked up by the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC). Tennekoon also played for the Ceylon Board President's XI. He made his career's highest score in a first class match against India in 1974, hitting an unbeaten 169. This is regarded as one of the best centuries scored by a Sri Lankan batsman before the country gained Test status.

The bobak marmot is a large analog of the North American prairie dog, with a particularly round paunch and a laid-back alert posture. Unlike most other species, bobak marmots prosper on rolling grasslands and on the edge of cultivated fields. Active for about five and a half months each year, dispersers leave their natal social group after their second hibernation. Litter sizes average a little over five, and it takes at least three years to reach sexual maturity. About 60% of adult females breed in a given year. They have a single alarm call, but studies have demonstrated that bobak marmots call faster when they live in steep terrain and slower when they live in flatter terrain. Bobak marmots have served as a natural food "reservoir" that has saved many Ukrainians, Russians and Soviets from starving to death during periodic famines over the last hundred years, and their fur is used to make hats and the occasional coat. Outside Moscow, a fur-farm is experimenting with breeding bobak marmots in captivity for captive fur production.
