The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius is a painting by John William Waterhouse completed in 1883. The painting depicts Honorius feeding birds which are on the rug in front of him; the dark colors of the rug and his clothes define a space. Separated from him and the birds are the councillors seeking his attention, and who along with the attendant are dressed in paler shades.
The game uses multiple currencies. Energy (in the form of "Gas cans") is necessary to play the game. Each time the player plays a level, their gas total drops by one. When there is no gas left, the player can no longer play, and can either buy more gas using Gold or must wait until their supply has automatically replenished. "Black" is necessary for crafting new items and upgrading weapons, and is awarded at the end of each level. If the player does not have enough Black to craft an item necessary for advancing the story, they must play previous levels, or purchase Black using Gold. "Flares" can be used at the end of each level to raise the player's score by one star. Flares can be randomly awarded during the game or purchased using Gold. "Silver" is necessary to activate "Charlotte's Bounty", which randomly awards a single prize in the form of an item, a weapon, a gas can, a flare or more silver. Silver is awarded randomly at the end of a level. "Gold" can be used to purchase any of the other currencies, and is only available using real-world money.
