In a separate trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship, Captain Francesco Schettino has been seeking a plea bargain agreement. However when his trial resumed in October 2013, the Moldavian dancer Domnica Cemortan, 26, admitted being his lover and being on the ship without a ticket, after the prosecution alleged that her presence on the bridge “generated confusion and distraction for the captain”. The helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin failed to turn up in March 2014 to give evidence and was thought to be somewhere in Indonesia. Roberto Ferrarini told the court in April that "Schettino asked me to tell the maritime authorities that the collision was down to a blackout on the ship. But I strongly objected." Passengers told the court in May that if they had followed the officers' orders to return to their cabins, they would have been drowned.
