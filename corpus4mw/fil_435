The Sabbath for Latter-day Saints is Sunday. This is explained in the LDS Bible Dictionary as: "After the ascension of Christ, the members of the Church, whether Jews or gentiles, kept holy the first day of the week (the Lord’s day) as a weekly commemoration of our Lord’s resurrection (Acts 20: 7; 1 Cor. 16: 2; Rev. 1: 10); and by degrees the observance of the seventh day was discontinued." (Excerpt taken from the LDS Bible Dictionary) There are some notable exceptions, such as Israel and some Arab countries, where Latter-day Saints celebrate Sabbath on Saturday or on Friday.

McChesney has questioned the idea that Capitalism drives innovation. Instead, he suggests Capitalism actually provides poor incentives for the risk and effort involved in innovation and that Capitalism's strength lies in exploiting new innovations for commercial application.

So the public sector does basic research and gets you to a point when it can be applied later. That’s the starting point to understand that."
