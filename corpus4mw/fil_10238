In 1958 James went back to Trinidad, where he edited "The Nation" newspaper for the pro-independence People's National Movement (PNM) party. He also became active again in the Pan-African movement. He believed that the Ghana revolution greatly encouraged anti-colonialist revolutionary struggle.
The singers are split into two evenly distributed groups. In the first étude, both altos and basses sing only one part each, while sopranos and tenors have solo parts. It features one of Ligeti's main compositional styles, the "meccanico", also used in his String Quartet No. 2 and in "Ramifications". In the second movement, all of the singers have solo parts. The third movement, however, is scored in a slightly different manner: sopranos, altos, tenors and basses from group I are all split and, together with group II as a whole, they all sing five different songs. Tempos in the third movement are different for each group. The étude starts with the basses from group I, which are marked "Tempo giusto (♩ = 90)"; then, the two altos from group I join in with different parts, marked "Allegro vivace (♩ = 160)"; both sopranos, which also play different parts, are the next ones to join, marked "Allegro con anima (♩ = 140)"; both tenors from group I join in some time later, playing both the same part at "Allegro moderato (♩ = 110)". Finally, group II as a whole joins the rest of the musicians. They are split into two parts, sopranos and altos from group II playing one part and tenors and basses from group II playing the other one. They all are marked "Vivacissimo (♩ = 190)". The composition is mathematically adjusted so that all musicians end the piece together. At the end of the last movement, Ligeti demands "absolute silence" with a thick black line drawn along the entire page.
Family ceremonies to mark birth, circumcision, marriage, and death are celebrated with palm wine or rum. Animal sacrifice is also performed.
