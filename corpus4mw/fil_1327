When Wariner signed to MCA Records in 1984, he began a string of consecutive Top Ten hits that lasted into the 1990s. The first of these was the No. 3 "What I Didn't Do", the first of three singles from his 1984 album "One Good Night Deserves Another". Following it were the No. 8 "Heart Trouble" and his second Number One, "Some Fools Never Learn". He also collaborated with pop singer Nicolette Larson on her Top Ten country hit "That's How You Know When Love's Right", her only Top 40 country single. It was also during this time that Steve recorded the theme song for the ABC television sitcom, "Who's the Boss?". Wariner's version of "Brand New Life", used from 1986 to 1990, is the most widely recognized rendition of the song.
