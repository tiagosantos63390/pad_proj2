A Disciple who was introduced in Death's Shadow, he was found hiding in a lifeboat on board a ship full of zombies and the site where Death fought and defeated Beranabus. When he was younger he wanted to become a stage magician, but lacked the knack for it although he was good enough for clubs; however, when he was found on the ship he was dressed undercover as a magician. He shows a complete lack of courage in battle and is known to be more of a spy for the Disciples than a fighter. At the end of "Death's Shadow" he is floating in the ocean in a lifeboat with Dervish and Bec. Kirilli also appears at the end of Wolf Island trying to flirt with nurses and telling them how he "single handedly battled" zombies (in truth, he ran away and when he did try to fight a zombie, it bit some of his fingers off). In Dark Calling, he appears to be resigned to fighting and still wears his now tattered stage magicians uniform. He fights bravely against millions of demons, attempting to rescue Meera Flame unsuccessfully. He has his right foot torn off and it is not replaced at the end of the book. In Hell's Heroes, he fights in a replaced stage uniform. he has a far less cowardly attitude and performs many brave acts. He and Kernel martial the remaining disciples when it seems all hope is lost. His final act is to take on a demon master, performing a deadly card trick which turns against him and ends up not only decapitating him but carving his head into many pieces. His new attitude could be part of the reason why his death hits Grubbs quite hard .Cause of death: Decapitation and dismemberment of skull.



By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy had been properly completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, but much of the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.

Sutton Manor was one of the largest pits in the Lancashire Coalfield, the deepest of the two shafts going over into the earth. Owing to their depth, they were not filled in: instead two three-metre thick reinforced concrete plugs were lifted into position over the two shafts, with venting pipes for methane. This has meant that annual surveys are carried out on the shafts; however recent surveys have shown that the shafts have little water in them.
