In his seven-year career as human rights lawyer, Shahid Azmi won 17 acquittals, though script focuses on his two cases, the 2006 Mumbai train bombings and the 2008 Mumbai attacks for dramatic effect. Azmi was eventually shot dead in his Mumbai office in February 2010 at age 32. The scene in which Azmi's face is blackened by assailants outside a courtroom, was actually a re-enactment of an incident from Mehta's own life.
