There has been a problem for about 20 years regarding the longterm damage of repeated concussions among National Football League (NFL) players, often as a result of contradicting study results published by the NFL. However, by 2010, the NFL finally acknowledged that many of its ex-players were suffering from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ('CTE').

Healthcare and social security in Belgium is a federal matter, but the special laws of Belgium grants the three communities several competences, such as "assistance to persons". The Flemish Government made use of this to provide an additional insurance for non-medical help and services, mainly targeted at elderly people. The insurance is mandatory for all people aged 25 and above and living in the Flemish Region, and optional for inhabitants of the Brussels-Capital Region (as Brussels is covered by both the Flemish and French Community).
Fiordland's terrain is dominated by mountains, fjords and glacial lakes carved up by glaciations during the last ice age, between 75,000 to 15,000 years ago. The region's coast is dotted by several fjords and other sea inlets which stretch from Milford Sound in the north to Preservation Inlet to the south. Farther north and east of Fiordland lie the Darran and Eyre Mountains which are part of the block of schist that extends into neighboring Central Otago.

Bibliography.

Early film, being a cutting-edge medium, also provided opportunity for bisexuality to be expressed. In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in "A Florida Enchantment", by Sidney Drew. However, due to the censorship legally required by the Hays Code, the word bisexual could not be mentioned and almost no bisexual characters appeared, in American film from 1934 until 1968.
An acclaimed biographer, Santopietro wrote in-depth studies of several Hollywood icons, who reflected and defined the American cultural landscape. These included Doris Day ("Considering Doris Day"), Barbra Streisand ("The Importance of Being Barbra"), and the definitive account of Frank Sinatra's Hollywood film career ("Sinatra in Hollywood").
