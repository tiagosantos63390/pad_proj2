Genetic distance is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle that populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are closer relations than populations that have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between the two populations due to isolation by distance and serial founder effects.Genetic admixture increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.
The brigade was set up between 1949 and 1951. The brigade, together with the Värmland regiment (I 2) was decommissioned June 30 in 2000. The brigades last commander was Colonel Björn Tomtlund.
