In 2001 he advanced until the final with his novel "La disciplina de la vanidad" at the Rómulo Gallegos Prize. Another time was in 2008 with his novel "Un lugar llamado Oreja de Perro" at the Premio Herralde. In all three cases he did not receive the principal award though. In 2007 he was mentioned as one of the 39 most promising Latin American writers.
