The prison riot is believed to have started when members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas clashed in the prison, using sharp-edged knives, stones, burning devices, and possibly firearms to kill rival cartel members. A prison spokesperson denied that firearms were involved. Some of the dead were strangled, thrown out of windows, stabbed, beheaded, hanged, bludgeoned, and crushed. An investigation was immediately launched into whether some of the 17 prison guards on duty colluded in the fight by unlocking the doors between the two wings of the prison. The prison director, the director of security, and the supervisor on duty were all detained for questioning. When the riot ended, 44 inmates who were reportedly members of the Gulf Cartel were killed. Moreover, 30 inmates of the Los Zetas drug cartel were allowed to escape by the prison guards, and government sources reveal that the fugitives were high-ranking members in the organization, former police officers, or drug dealers.
