Thomas Henry's rise as an illustrator was fast. He regularly started publishing cartoons in top magazines like Punch by 1913. By 1920, he was an established illustrator, having published widely in leading publications like the Strand Magazine and London Mail. Henry defined the image of Richmal Crompton's William for magazines in 1919 and followed it up by illustrating the first William book - Just William, when it was published in 1922. He eventually went on to illustrate 33 William books.
