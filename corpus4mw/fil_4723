Designated a New Town in 1967, Peterborough Development Corporation decided to construct a new purpose-built shopping centre in the heart of the revitalised city. Planning permission was received in the late summer of 1976 and, in the November of that year, the John Lewis Partnership announced that it had agreed to be the anchor shop in the new development. The opening of John Lewis Peterborough (and Waitrose supermarket) marked a return to the city after an absence of over twenty five years. Until 1956, when the two main blocks of the building were completely destroyed by fire, the John Lewis Partnership had a small department store in Peterborough trading under the name of Robert Sayle. Originally known as Thomsons, the shop had been renamed following acquisition by the Partnership in 1940. Robert Sayle was itself renamed John Lewis Cambridge after a major refurbishment in 2007.

In the early 18th century individuals often said they looked for "candor" in each other, meaning fairness, kindliness, and good temper. "People wanted a spouse who did not pry too deeply.

When she was around 10, Fantcha joined the Flores do Mindelo carnival company. Like in Brazil, carnival is one of the most important social event in Mindelo. Gregorio Gonçalves, a.k.a. Ti Goy, at that time one of the most famous composers in the city, was the Flores do Mindelo music director. Soon he realized that this young shrill-voiced girl had a timbre that people would notice, a voice that would make the difference in the tough competition the carnival companies were indulged in. But, besides her voice and her look, Ti Goy detected in her a promising talent: he told her that she should become a singer and offered her some training lessons.
