Sappho treats the wedding scene and the pervading theme of love with a sensuous delicacy absent from those works dealing in cruel and masculine themes. The tone of the poetic fragment emphasizes a mood of joyous anticipation for the domestic festivity about to take place. Just as Homer included domestic illustrations of daily life for the Trojans in Book 22 of the "Iliad", Sappho similarly depicts a jubilant scene which would have been of social prominence for her culture in Lesbos. Much passion and social attention, for instance, were paid to the ceremonies surrounding a bride. The tone of this fragment also asserts Sappho’s characterization of females, a prominent motif in much of her work. As enumerated in Sappho’s visual imagery, an emphasis on lightheartedness and frivolity along with indulgence in ornaments and furnishings belies her characterization of the female persona.

The book was reviewed in "Publishers Weekly" in 2001: "As used here with controlled repetitions, the sequence gives the whole an almost medieval sense of restriction[. Abstracted cold war fears and post-'70s ecological concern and alienation give way to litanies of real world outrages ... which culminate in a post-nuclear holocaust nightmare, with birds and children somehow having survived in caves. The scenario may seem dated, but the threats remain very real, and Christensen's poetic appeal for sanity and humanity remains an abstracted call to action."
