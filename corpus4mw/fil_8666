Thomas Lewis.
Lojane is known in Macedonia and Serbia for its heavy presence of illegal immigrants who are unable to advance to Serbia on their journey to European Union territory such as Italy or Austria. The immigrants lodged in Lojane remain until a situation presents itself for each individual to successfully cross into Serbia escaping Serbian authorities - many have been successfully repelled by Serbian police which explains their continued stay in Lojane. The population of the village is mixed in its perception of the outsiders: some are pleased with the short-term prospect that they pump money into businesses when they arrive, though as time goes by and some remain longer, worries emerge that the new population spread crime and diseases to the locals - coupled with the outsiders' money running low and their need to survive.
