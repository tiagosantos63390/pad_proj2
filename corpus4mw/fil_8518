The ecological effects of tetracyclines and quinolones have been observed. They are not metabolized in the human body and are therefore excreted unmodified. When entered into the environment they are poorly degraded. They can be toxic to other animals, affecting particularly microorganism and fish. In the effluent from a sewage plant in India, several broad spectrum antibiotics were found in concentrations toxic to bacteria and plants. In the sewage plant itself, there were enterococcae resistant to all known antibiotics.

Later career.
Since 1900, 99 Category 4 hurricanes have been recorded in the eastern and central Pacific basins. Of these, thirteen have attained Category 4 status on more than one occasion, by weakening to a status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale lower than Category 4 and later restrengthening into a Category 4. Such storms are demarcated by the dates they first attained and the final time they lost the intensity. Only two storms, Hurricane Fico in 1978 and Hurricane Norbert in 1984, reached Category 4 status three times or more.
