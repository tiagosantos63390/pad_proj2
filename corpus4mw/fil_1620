History.
Robert Rozhdestvensky was born to a military family in the village of Kosikha in Altai Krai. Following the outbreak of World War II, with both parents in the army, he found himself in the orphanage. After graduating high school, he attended Petrozavodsk University, where he began writing poetry (the first ones were published in 1950). He quit the University in order to attend Maxim Gorky Literature Institute, which he finished in 1956.
In 1947 Derry won the National Football League. The group leaders were invited to play in the League semi-finals because heavy snow had disrupted the competition. Francie Niblock scored one of the finest goals in League history in Croke Park as Derry beat Clare. In 1958, the county won its first ever Ulster Senior Football Championship and caused a massive shock in that year's All-Ireland semi-final, beating Kerry thanks to a Sean O'Connell goal three minutes from the end. In the final, Derry scored a goal ten minutes into the second half through Owen Gribben, but Dublin secured victory with Paddy Farnan and Johnny Joyce goals.

Morrison frequently refers to D.C. area locations and themes in his songs. References include:
Orville Coast is that portion of the coast of Antarctica lying west of Ronne Ice Shelf between Cape Adams and Cape Zumberge. It was discovered by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947-48, under Ronne, who named this coast for Captain Howard T. Orville, USN, Head of the Naval Aerological Service, who was largely responsible for formulating the RARE meteorological program. The name "Orville Coast" is considered a more useful reference than "Orville Escarpment," the name originally applied for this area.
Underground telegraph cables into large buildings or between stations often needed to carry multiple independent telegraph lines. These cables took the form of multiple insulated conductors enclosed by a metal screen and overall protective jacket. In such cables the screen can be used as the return conductor. Undersea telegraph cables were usually a single conductor protected by steel-wire armour, effectively a coaxial cable. The first transatlantic cable of this kind was completed in 1866.
By late 2002 and early 2003, O’Hanlon appeared in the American media as a public proponent of the Iraq War. Interviewed by Bill O’Reilly in February 2003, he was asked “Any doubt about going to war with Saddam?” To which he replied “Not much doubt.”

Having car trouble, they stop at a seedy-looking gas station, where they are tended to by Roy Scudder, the owner. Instead of helping the mother and child, Scudder rigs the vehicle to break down a short distance down the road. Then he drives down the road and offers to tow them back to his place.

Magee founded the "Magee's Independent" in 1922, which would change its name to the "New Mexico State Tribune" in 1923 and to the "Albuquerque Tribune" in 1933. The Tribune became defunct in 2008. Magee was important in bringing the Teapot Dome Scandal to the fore. When a judge Magee had once accused of corruption knocked him down in a hotel lobby, Magee drew his pistol fired, accidentally killing a bystander. Magee was acquitted of manslaughter, but moved to Oklahoma City to run the Oklahoma News. He was the paper's editor until he was transferred to the "Oklahoma City News".
