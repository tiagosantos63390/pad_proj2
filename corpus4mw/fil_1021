Dallara has been dominant since the mid-1990s – in both results and numbers – but the chassis of some of its main competitors have been adopted in small numbers. The Lola B06/30 and the Mygale M07/F3 are each represented by two-car teams and the older Dome F106 is used by a two-car team in the Scholarship class. In the interests of parity, identical tyres are supplied by Cooper Tire.

Construction of "Forbin" began in Lorient on 8 April 2002. The hull was built in 14 sections by a variety of subcontractors of DCN, including several companies from Saint-Nazaire. Each section was 7 metres high, and 16 to 20 metres long. "Forbin" was laid down on 16 January 2004; the hull sections were transferred from Saint-Nazaire to Lorient on a barge tugged by "Alcyon" and assembled there from February 2004 to January 2005, finishing with the bow. The engines were delivered by FiatAvio in September.
