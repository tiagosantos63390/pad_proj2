The Brick Castle of William Bull III, an early settler of the region, is located on a hill overlooking the Wallkill River in the Town of Wallkill in Orange County, New York. It was built by Bull sometime in the 1780s. Bull and his son William IV, on returning home from serving with Gen. George Washington's campaign against the British, had been impressed with the buildings of Baltimore and other Atlantic seaports visited during his military service. The title of 'Brick Castle,' is shared among a few early brick homes constructed in the area around the same time. Bull, himself a stonemason by trade, decided upon arriving home to build a brick homestead. He is also known for having constructed Gen. Washington's headquarters at Newburgh, NY.
