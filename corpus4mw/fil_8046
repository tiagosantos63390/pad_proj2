Maier’s major research fields comprise physical chemistry of the solid state, thermodynamics and kinetics, defect chemistry and transport in solids, ionic and mixed conductors, boundary regions and electrochemistry. In this context energy transfer and storage are to the fore. Maier developed a scientific field nowadays termed nanoionics. In these fields Maier has authored/coauthored more than 600 publications in peer reviewed journals.
Following a successful second season with the Rowdies, Real Salt Lake of MLS announced that they had signed Attinella on December 3, 2012. He made his RSL debut as a second-half sub for an injured Josh Saunders in a 3–0 win against FC Dallas on July 13th.

In the theory of quantum communication, the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel is the highest rate at which classical information can be transmitted from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. It is given by the quantum mutual information of the channel, which is the input-output quantum mutual information maximized over all pure bipartite quantum states with one system transmitted through the channel. This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem, in the sense that this formula is equal to the capacity, and there is no need to regularize it. An additional feature that it shares with Shannon's formula is that a noiseless classical or quantum feedback channel cannot increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts: the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem. The direct coding theorem demonstrates that the quantum mutual information of the channel is an achievable rate, by a random coding strategy that is effectively a noisy version of the super-dense coding protocol. The converse theorem demonstrates that this rate is optimal by making use of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.

By mid-1918, Maud had been posted to 66 Squadron in Italy as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 1 May 1918, he scored his first aerial victory when he destroyed an opposing Albatros D.III southwest of Conegliano. By 20 May, he was an ace, having driven down an Albatros D.V on that day for his fifth win. By 7 October 1918, he had run his total to 11; his tally amounted to five enemy reconnaissance planes and three fighters destroyed, with another three enemy planes driven down out of control. His feats earned him a Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 7 November 1918.

The properties concerned were of considerable significance to the economy. The smaller states, especially, depended for their existence on being able to get control of the major assets. In Mecklenburg-Strelitz, for example, the disputed land alone represented 55 percent of the area of the state. In other, smaller, states the figure was 20 percent to 30 percent of the area. In larger states like Prussia or Bavaria, however, the percentage of disputed land was of little significance, but the absolute sizes involved were equivalent to duchies elsewhere. The demands of the royal houses totalled 2.6 billion marks.

As the site grew, so did the staffing levels and in September 2010 Brutal Gamer was ranking inside the top 4,000 sites in the UK, and slowly cracking the top slots in the US and Canada. This marked the biggest impact on the site and it was now becoming a recognisable “brand” in the global gaming community. The ranking placed it above contemporaries like Now Gamer, Beefjack, GamerLimit, Sarcastic Gamer to name but a few.

Queen Joan ruled with her husband Antoine for many years, during this time they were called to the King of France and it proposed that Joan and Antoine give up their lands to the Kingdom of France in exchange for territory in France. The Kingdom of Navarre would have passed into French control and they royalty of Navarre would become princelings. Joan refused this offer and the Kingdom of Navarre stayed as it was until her death. Henry IV was the son of Jeanne and Antoine and would gain the title King of France and Navarre when he became king.
The Main Battle Tank thus took on the role the British had once called the 'Universal tank', filling almost all battlefield roles. The British Centurion was the classic main battle tank of the 1950s along with the Soviet T-55 series, and the US M47/M48 series. These were upgraded significantly over time, as for example, the Centurion began life with the highly effective 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun, but was upgraded to 20 pounder (84 mm) and then 105 mm main armament by 1959, with improved fire control and new engines. The British Centurion and the 2 other tanks series and their derivatives formed the bulk of the armored forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War and some remain in use in the 21st century.

Another example of the role of IRGs in the mouse model of infection is demonstrated by the differential recruitment of IRGs which alter the outcome of "Chlamydia trachomatis", a human adapted, versus "Chlamydia muridarum", mouse adapted, inclusions following entry. "C. trachomatis" inclusions recruit a full repertoire of IRGs which aid in the inclusion elimination via fusion with lysosomes. Regulation of IRG expression and activity in this model was found to be dependent both on levels of phospholipase C, cPLA2, as well as upstream IFN signaling. cPLA2 null mouse cells, when challenged with "C. trachomatis", were less capable of clearing the pathogen compared to cells with proper cPLA2 expression. The model highlights the co-evolution demonstrated by effector molecules of "C. muridarum" functioning to restrict accumulation of mouse IRGs on inclusions by modifying Irgb10, whereas the human pathogen is incapable of modifying the mouse IRG response. This mechanism requires additional involvement of cellular autophagy machinery, which is in contrast to the necrotic pathway activation in T. gondii clearance. A refined mechanism will require additional studies to elucidate the cooperation between the autophagy machinery and IRGs involved in the fusion of bacterial inclusions with the lysosome, as well as the specific bacterial effector molecules used to manipulate the coordinated actions of IRGs.

Modernizr uses feature detection, rather than checking the browser's property, to discern what a browser can and cannot do. It considers feature detection more reliable since the same rendering engine may not necessarily support the same things in two different browsers using that engine. In addition, some users change their user agent string to get around websites that block features for browsers with specific user agent settings, despite their browsers having the necessary capabilities.
