The Supreme Court Database is an NSF-funded collaboration among six universities. The project’s inception occurred decades ago as Professor Harold J. Spaeth (Michigan State University) attempted to document and code every vote put forth by a U.S. Supreme Court justice in all argued cases over a five-decade span. Professor Spaeth's work has become an indispensable body of information for those who study supreme court politics. In 2007 Professor Lee Epstein (Northwestern University) was awarded NSF funding to modernize and extend Spaeth's Database. Professor Martin and CERL’s participation involves overseeing the expansion, including developing a comprehensive dataset as well as facilitating a backdating project which is currently classifying data from the founding of the court in 1790 through the current term.

His Juanita Banana a star? 
Once the traitors are destroyed, a thankful elder gives O’Neil some herbs to help Jackson, who was injured while leaving Ra’s hidden spaceship. Once found and healed, Jackson informs O’Neil that Sha’uri has been captured by Anubis. This leads to a second one-on-one fight between O’Neil and Anubis. After Anubis is defeated for good, O’Neil raids the armory of Ra’s spaceship and creates a plan. Jackson will cripple the guidance system of Ra’s glider force inside Ra’s spaceship while O’Neil will arm the rebellion with weapons stolen from the spaceship. Realizing that the rebellion is still outnumbered, O’Neil takes to the air to destroy several of Ra’s gliders. After landing, O’Neil searches for a village elder who can show him a secret route into Ra’s pyramid. Once inside, O’Neil joins Jackson in crippling the guidance systems of Ra’s gliders and disabling the glider bay doors to prevent any gliders from landing or taking off. Now the Nagadan forces are ready to assault Ra’s spaceship. Just before the rebellion’s assault begins, Jackson and Sha’uri are taken prisoner on board the spaceship. O’Neil goes to face Ra, one-on-one.

Critics also spoke positively about the gameplay and system mechanics. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot credited the ability to adjust team sizes, adding that the "trade-off between raw strength and versatility helps accommodate a wider skill range." McGee praised the underlying fighting system, stating that it offers "several smart and simple alternatives for typical fighting game annoyances such as high/low unblockables and infinite loops." Neidel Crisan of 1UP said "competitive players will be more than pleased with "Skullgirls"' gameplay system, and it teaches beginner players things about the genre they wouldn't have learned otherwise without attending tournaments or digging through pages of forum posts." Daniel Maniago of G4 complimented the custom assists, anti-infinite system, and GGPO-enhanced online play, praising Reverge Labs for "listen closely to fans of the game as well as the fighting game community" during development. Maniago summarized by labeling "Skullgirls" as "a beautifully crafted game that builds upon good ideas of fighting games before it while addressing issues that fighting games often have."
