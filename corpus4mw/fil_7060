In the same morning that Scatterbrain died, new team member Scanner was visited in his dreams by what appeared to be Scatterbrain. "Scatterbrain" warned him of the "new ones" (the alien race known as VXX199), the conspiracy of the corrupt politician Andre Lemont, and his teammate Shear. When Scanner woke up, he checked on the comatose Scatterbrain, only to discover he had just died of the Morituri effect that morning. All of Scatterbrain's warnings proved correct.
