By October 1977, an electric light was added to the lighthouse and by 31 October of that year, the Keepers were withdrawn as the Maidens became an automatic operation and control passed to Ferris Point. Currently, the station is monitored by an Attendant as well as from the headquarters of the Commissioners of Irish Lights at Dun Laoghaire. A racon showing Morse code "M" (--) was added in 1996. The light's nominal range was reduced from 24 to 23 nautical miles in September 2010 and the light characteristic was set at three white flashes every 15 seconds (Fl (3) W 15s). The lighthouse buildings remain in good repair.

WKYC News reported that during Castro's interrogation, he recalled each of the three abductions in great detail and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, Castro did not have an "exit plan" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as "coldblooded" and a sex addict. Police found a suicide note in Castro's home in which he allegedly discussed the abductions and wrote that his money, videos and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught.

The "saisie-contrefaçon" order handed down by the judge authorises the requesting party to dispatch the bailiff of its choice, possibly accompanied by an expert, of its choice or by a member of the police force, to any place where proof of the infringement might be found, to make either a “detailed description” of the elements found in his report – a description that can be accompanied by the taking of samples – or a “physical seizure”, i.e. the confiscation of the elements found and attached to the report, again drafted by the bailiff to record the operations performed. The "saisie-contrefaçon" may relate to infringing products, documents relating to the infringement but also materials and implements used in the production or diffusion of the infringing goods. In the particular field of copyright and related rights, illustrating the sometimes more protective than probative nature of the "saisie-contrefaçon" (see below France – Background), the President of the competent tribunal de grande instance may also order the following: the suspension of any manufacturing in progress involved in the unlawful reproduction of a work (or of the object of a related right) or in the violation of the protection or information technical measures; the seizure of monetary proceeds from any reproduction, performance or diffusion, by whatever means, of an intellectual work (or of the object of a related right) carried out in violation of the author’s rights or deriving from a violation of the protection or information technical measures; the handing over to a third party of the unlawful works or the products suspected of being unlawful in order to prevent that they be introduced or circulated in commercial channels (French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1).

Most healthcare providers also allow the patient to specify if they have any preferences towards the examiner's gender. This is done not only to avoid potential embarrassment of having an intimate exam handled by a male, but to also help ensure an environment where the patient feels important questions about her sexual health can be answered truthfully.

Waterfowl males of the family Aves: Anatidae have evolved a phallus to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a counter-clockwise coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from forceful intermission. Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.

The album received favourable reviews from many critics and journalists alike. Molloy Woodcraft, writing for "The Observer", called the album "an absolute corker" and "a great record". Reviewing for the Music website, Drowned in Sound, Matthew Slaughter stated "...it’s a record of reflection, of experimentation, sometimes of egotism, often of near-mystical sadness". "Restless, melodic and endlessly absorbing, Man & Myth is the sound of an artist at the peak of his power" was the conclusion by Martin Townsend in his review for the "Daily Express". Steve Creedy reviewing for "The Australian" stated the album "compares well with illustrious predecessors such as "Stormcock" and "HQ"" and that it was "a welcome addition to a remarkable career". The "Financial Times" reviewer, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney awarded the album four out of five stars and said "acoustic guitar melodies meander along gracefully, building into moments of great agitation; raw emotional honesty coexists with mythmaking lyrics romanticising Harper as the eternal outsider". Writing for "Goldmine", Dave Thompson proclaimed "Man and Myth" to be "a genuine triumph, a magnificent achievement...this isn’t a 'return to form'. It’s business as brilliant usual. Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek praised Harper's writing for remaining "keen and opulent" and stated that his "loopy phrasing and lyrics lie in their own country" existing "outside of the usual singer/songwriter tropes". His melismatic phrasing is as musical as the gorgeous strings, guitars, drums, and mellotrons in the sonic architecture framing his voice. "Man and Myth" is Harper at his best, fully in command of his vision, his curious, lovely melodic sensibility, and, of course, his poetry".

Smallpox was an unknown disease not only in Mexico, but in the Americas, before the arrival of Europeans. It was introduced to Mexican lands by the Spanish, a relevant event in history as it was a factor in the downfall of the Aztec Empire. Hernán Cortés departed from Cuba and arrived to Mexico in 1519, sent to start trade relations on the Veracruz Coast. However, he disobeyed the Cuban governor and began to invade the mainland. The Cuban governor sent Pánfilo de Narváez after Cortés. Narvaez’s forces had at least one active case of smallpox, and when the Narvaez expedition stopped at Cozumel and Veracruz in 1520, the disease gained a foothold in the region.

There are many examples of contamination of biomaterials that are specific to the preparation or manufacturing process. Additionally, nearly all surfaces are prone to contamination of organic impurities in the air. Contamination layers are usually limited to a monolayer or less of atoms and are thus only detectable by surface analysis techniques, such as XPS. It is unknown whether this sort of contamination is harmful, yet it is still regarded as contamination and will most certainly have an impact on surface properties.
