The GSO projection (named after Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joël Scherk, and David I. Olive) is an ingredient used in constructing a consistent model in superstring theory. The projection is a selection of a subset of possible vertex operators in the worldsheet conformal field theory (CFT)--usually those with specific worldsheet fermion number and periodicity conditions. Such a projection is necessary to obtain a consistent worldsheet CFT. For the projection to be consistent, the set "A" of operators retained by the projection must satisfy:
