On September 12, 2012, the prosecution filed a superseding indictment adding nine more felony counts. George Washington University Law School Professor Orin Kerr, writing on the legal blog "Volokh Conspiracy", opined that the risk of a maximum sentence in Swartz’s case was not high. In an interview with Boston's WBUR, retired federal judge Nancy Gertner said a sentence of 35 years for a case like Swartz's "never occurs." She questioned the propriety of pressing these charges at all.

Carrying the top weight of 125 pounds, she started at odds of 100/15 in a field consisting of six colts and two fillies. Miss Jummy took the lead in the final quarter mile and held off a late challenge from Martinet to win "cleverly" by three quarters of a length. Three days later she reappeared in the Great Challenge Stakes, a weight-for-age race over six furlongs. She carried 97 pounds and Watts was replaced by a lightweight jockey.

The Revolution in America not only separated Americans from the government and monarchy of Great Britain, it also severed ties with the Church of England. The eighth minister, the New Haven born Ebenezer Punderson, began as a SPG missionary priest, but became part of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America during the Revolutionary War when the American Anglican churches could no longer be supported from England. After 1781, Trinity would be led by entirely members of the newly created Protestant Episcopal Church of America, and were entitled to be called Rector. Thus there have been eight Priests in Charge of the New Haven parish region, and fifteen Rectors.
