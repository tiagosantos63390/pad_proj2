The Australian national team is one of the most successful in world tennis. They are seven-time world champions and have reached a total of seventeen finals, both second highest all-time behind United States.

However, in recent times the Australian team has had a comparative lack of success, only appearing in the World Group five times between 1995 and 2010, and never going beyond the first round.
