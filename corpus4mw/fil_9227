In the 1991–92 season, the Blades had a poor start to the season and were bottom of the table at the beginning of November with just 2 wins in their first 15 league games and were destined for relegation but from mid-January, Bassett's team went on an impressive run, losing only 2 of their next 15 league games, picking up 34 points from the possible 45 during that run which saw them rise from being relegation candidates to an impressive 9th place finish. Their highlight of the season was doing the double over their rivals Sheffield Wednesday, who finished 3rd that season.

On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from locals. Michael Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being “neutral from the conflicts of others". He called on border residents to “stand beside their army and assist its members.” Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.

Sometimes this company also does post-production for some Bollywood or other films made in another region of India that are already shot in the same language during the acting stage that this studio is dubbing, but for some reasons. Sometimes certain actors can't convey their voices to certain tones, accents or dialects well enough due to either temporal health issues, certain conditions that prevents actors to transmit through their roles, or by all means of disusing their voices. That is why dubbing artists are hired by being called-in to dub for corresponding actors to resolve the solution, depending on how the director wants it to be, whenever that film needs to be into the process of ADR or not.
Niki Lauda took out bank loans secured by his life insurance policy to pay for his first Formula One race seat with March in 1971. He secured a drive with BRM for 1973 but his debts continued to grow. Team mate Clay Regazzoni moved to Ferrari for the next season and convinced Enzo Ferrari to buy Lauda out of his contract with BRM. His career took off and he was victorious twice in 1974 on his way to fourth in the drivers' championship. Five wins in 1975 helped him to claim his first drivers' title, and he looked likely to retain it the following year until a near-fatal crash at Nürburgring sidelined him. Despite first-degree burns to his head and hands, the loss of half an ear, and several broken bones, Lauda returned after just six weeks and missed only two races. Jackie Stewart described it as the most courageous comeback in the history of sport. In 1977, Lauda finished on the podium in 10 of the 14 races he started, winning the title for a second time. He left Ferrari for Brabham and won two races in 1978, but only finished seven of the 16 races. The next year proved to be a particular low point and Lauda only managed to finish two races, leading to his retirement from the sport. His absence was only short-lived however and he returned as a driver for McLaren in 1982. He raced with the team for four years, winning five races and a third drivers' title in 1984 before retiring again – and this time permanently at the end of 1985.
