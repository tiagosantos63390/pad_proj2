HN-3 is the enlarged version of the Chinese HN-2, and many Chinese sources have claimed that by this time, Chinese capability was matured enough to develop this project on its own. HN-3 actually increased in size and weight in comparison to earlier HN-1 and HN-2 missiles, and some sources have claimed that it is even larger than the Kh-65. The range of HN-3 is subject to debate, claims vary on the range, from greater than a thousand kilometers to nearly three thousand kilometers. However, DH-10, another Chinese land attack cruise missile with range between two thousand to three thousand kilometers based on Kh-55, the estimation of the range of HN-3 between one thousand and two thousand kilometers is more probable. Although some sources outside China estimates the range of HN-3 is somewhere between fourteen hundred and eighteen hundred kilometers, most Chinese sources claim the range of HN-3 is around twelve hundred kilometers. The most common beliefs are that the HN-3 has a range of about 3,000 km. HN-3 reportedly entered Chinese service in 2002, and a ground-launched version is also reportedly developed.

On July 30, 2011, a senior researcher of the Academy of Military Sciences said China needed at least three aircraft carriers. "If we consider our neighbours, India will have three aircraft carriers by 2014 and Japan will have three carriers by 2014, so I think the number (for China) should not be less than three so we can defend our rights and our maritime interests effectively." General Luo Yuan. In July 2011, a Chinese official announced that two aircraft carriers were being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. On 21 May 2012, Taiwan's intelligence chief Tsai Teh-sheng told the Legislative Yuan that the PLA Navy plans to build two carriers, scheduled to start construction in 2013 and 2015 and launch in 2020 and 2022 respectively. On 24 April 2013 Chinese Rear Admiral "Song Xue" confirmed that China will build more carriers and these will be larger and will carry more fighter-planes than the "Liaoning". In December 2013 China's Central Military Commission told Duowei News it planned to commission two Liaoning-pattern aircraft carriers by 2020, designated as Type 001A. Contracts have been awarded to China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation to build the two carriers. The cost is projected to be US$9 billion. A waist catapult could be fitted to one or both vessels to facilitate airborne early warning aircraft operation and air control. Presently "Liaoning" combines unassisted ski-jump launched aircraft with helicopters for antisubmarine and air defense operations.

Luzena recalled, “We had lived eighteen months in Nevada City when fire cut us adrift again, as water had done in Sacramento.” Fire swept through and burned the “El Dorado” to the ground and the Wilsons decided to journey back towards Sacramento. However, having found it much changed, they lingered for a few months and decided to venture on to the valley. After four or five days of easy traveling the Wilson’s pitched their tent along the first outlying range of low foothills. Luzena wrote, of their desire to settle in the valley. Lacking the funds to buy land, Mason set off to cut hay in order to make money, leaving Luzena on her own. She created a sign with scrap wood and charred embers saying “Wilson’s Hotel” and started over again. Luzena remained in Vacaville for 27 prosperous years. Her meager beginnings with the “Wilson’s Hotel” grew once again into a money making business. Luzena invested their money into numerous properties in the area.

The first two missions each consists of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters.

IR is a discipline with many facets and at the same time influences and is influenced by many other scientific disciplines. Indeed, IR ranges from Computer Science to Information Science and beyond; moreover, a large number of IR methods and techniques are adopted and absorbed by several technologies. The IR core methods and techniques are those for designing and developing IR systems, Web search engines, and tools for information storing and querying in Digital Libraries. IR core subjects are: system architectures, algorithms, formal theoretical models, and evaluation of the diverse systems and services that implement functionalities of storing and retrieving documents from multimedia document collections, and over wide area networks such as the Internet.
