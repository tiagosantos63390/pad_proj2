The concept of time and TVXQ's own tenth anniversary is referenced throughout "Tense", and the titles of TVXQ's older hit singles, starting from their debut single "Hug" (2004), are used in the lyrics for the album's opening track "Ten (10 Years)". A pop song with swing and big band influences, the album's lead single "Something" is intended to be a song with mass appeal. It is noted for being a major musical departure from TVXQ's earlier songs, which had heavy R&B, rock, and hip hop attributes. Continuing with the vintage theme set off from "Something", the album's third track "Your Man" is a retro pop punk song, and the dance pop song "Moonlight Fantasy" added gospel sounds for a more harmonious effect. The R&B pop number "Off-Road" is the Korean version of the English-language song "Runnin' On Empty", a song TVXQ recorded in 2011 for the film "Make Your Move 3D". U-Know Yunho also made a cameo appearance in the film, dancing to the song. Changmin wrote the lyrics for the ballad "Rise".
