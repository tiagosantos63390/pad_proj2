In June that same year, "Helen Whittier" was one of the Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. "Helen Whittier" sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu.

Desmond left Kit Carson and owned a restaurant in Golden, Colorado, then later a saloon in Georgetown, Colorado. He went back to work for the railroad, and by 1872 he had married and settled in Pueblo, Colorado. Not long afterward he began working as a deputy for the Pueblo County, Colorado Sheriffs Office.

This also led to his having a reputation for police brutality.

The special election was initially thought to be a "certain victory" for the Republican candidate, but became "fiercely competitive", according to "The New York Times", because of a U.S. House Republican plan to privatize Medicare. The Times has also cited the candidacy of third party candidate Davis as a factor which is "siphoning support" from Corwin. "The Hill" said the Medicare issue seemed to be boosting Hochul's campaign, though it was difficult to handicap the race because of the presence of the third party candidate.
