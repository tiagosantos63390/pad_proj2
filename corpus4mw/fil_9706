Example
The current modification of the Liaz truck is a result of a ten-year continuous development by the team around Martin Macik. The team holds two almost identical race specials, which differ only in the number of turbochargers used. Liaz Race Truck 1 was driven by Jaroslav Valtr at Dakar 2013 and its engine is charged with one turbocharger. The truck was primarily built in 2011 and at its construction certain components from the trucks that Martin Macik and Vlastimil Vildman drove in 2009-2011 were used. Most importantly, the truck received a new chassis frame set with an increased rigidity and integrated tow eyes at the front and rear. New leaf springs with a different suspension characteristics were supplied and, as a new thing, shock absorbers made by FRT are mounted.
