Queer Nation members were known for entering social spaces like straight bars and clubs and engaging in straight-identified behaviour like playing spin the bottle to make the point that most public spaces were straight spaces. QN would stage "kiss-ins" in public places like shopping malls or sidewalks, both as a shock tactic directed at heterosexuals and to point out that LGBT people should be able to engage in the same public behaviours as straight people. Echoing the disruption a decade earlier during the filming of "Cruising", Queer Nation and other direct action groups disrupted filming of "Basic Instinct" over what they believed were negative portrayals of lesbian and bisexual women.
