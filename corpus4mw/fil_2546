Prior to serving as state representative, Williams was elected to the Saginaw city council—an office which he held from November 11, 1991 until April 17, 2000. Saginaw's city charter prohibits currently serving members of the city council from seeking any other elective office. As a consequence, Williams resigned from the city council immediately prior to becoming a candidate for state representative. During his tenure as a city councilman, Williams was selected by the city council to serve as mayor pro tempore for two years.
