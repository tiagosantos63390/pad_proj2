The biggest move that Layden made during the 2002-03 season was completed on draft night. After selecting Nenê with the 7th pick in the 2002 NBA draft, he was immediately traded along with Marcus Camby and Mark Jackson to the Denver Nuggets in return for power forward Antonio McDyess, the draft rights to guard Frank Williams and a 2003 second-round draft pick. McDyess, a former #2 draft pick, was already limited to role-player status due to chronic injury; He played only 18 games for the Knicks. Williams was a disappointment from the beginning, his Knick career lasted 65 games with only three starts. On the other end of this transaction, Denver received a solid NBA player in power forward/center Marcus Camby. Camby had averaged a double-double (at least 10 rebounds and 10 points per-game) over his last two seasons as a Knick and nearly 2 blocked shots, along with being an integral part of New York's eastern conference title in 1999.

It is best known as being loudly chanted at basketball games at Allen Fieldhouse and football games at University of Kansas Memorial Stadium. During pregame, the refrain of "Rock chalk... Jay-Hawk... KU," is repeated twice slowly, and then three times quickly. It is usually preceded by the Kansas alma mater "Crimson and the Blue", and followed by the fight song, "I'm a Jayhawk". Since the early 1980s, Kansas fans have been known to do the slow repetition of "Rock chalk... Jay-Hawk... KU" when the Jayhawks are believed to be safely ahead, and victory is guaranteed.

Hiller fought in the Prussian theater during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779). Distinguishing himself in the Austro-Turkish War (1787–1792) for his vigor in defending his sector of Croatia, von Hiller was made Lieutenant Colonel in 1788 and was awarded the Knight’s Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa.

The island's location means that migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, such as an Isabelline Shrike in 2003, a White-billed Diver in 2002, and a Dusky Warbler in 2000.

The Clan MacGillivray was an important clan even before the Norsemen were driven out of the Outer Hebrides by king Somerled who was Lord of the Isles in the 12th century. In 1222 Alexander II of Scotland subdued Argyll and the "Clan Mhic Gillebrath" became dispersed. Some of the clan remained on the Isle of Mull while others stayed in Morvern. There is a tradition that asserts that the chief of the clan placed himself under the protection of the chiefs of Clan Mackintosh, who were also chiefs of the Chattan Confederation. Thereafter the Clan MacGillivray belonged to the Clan Chattan.

In 2015, the Magic Weekend was forced to move due to construction at the Etihad Stadium, which would commence immediately after the 2014-15 Premier League Season, which meant the Magic Weekend was due to be changed, with Coventry's Ricoh Arena and Newcastle upon Tyne's St James Park being considered by the RFL. Blake Solly had confirmed that the Etihad and Super League did have a good partnership, but there were alternatives available to host the event. On the 10th September 2014, it was confirmed that the Magic Weekend had been awarded to Newcastle for 2015, and would be played 5th and 6 May 2015. With the Super League Reformatting in 2015, the Magic Weekend will feature twelve teams and six matches, as opposed to the seven games in previous years.
Two common temperate zone species, "Chlorociboria aeruginascens" and "Chlorociboria aeruginosa", can only reliably be distinguished by microscopic examination. "Chlorociboria aeruginosa" has larger spores (9–15 µm × 1.5–2.5 µm) and the worm-like cells of the outer surface are rough, unlike the commoner "C. aeruginascens", of which the spores are 6–10 µm × 1.5–2 µm.
