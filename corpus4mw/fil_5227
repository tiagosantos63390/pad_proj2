Andrew was a seminal member of U.S. Thugs, where he gained the name 'Champion' when he had rushed to get a tattoo for the crews' original name (The 'East Bay Champions'). He was the only one to get the tattoo prior to the final selection of U.S. Thugs as the crew's name (Lars went to the tattoo shop in San Francisco but didn't have enough money to get the tattoo by Daniel Higgs of Lungfish fame). He was also one of the first four to get the original U.S. Thugs tattoo from Eric Hogan in Sacramento. Eric and Andrew had been friends from when Eric had lived in Alameda and Oakland years before. The name Champion however stuck as Andrew's stage name from then on and to this day people still use it. He later had a falling out with one of the members of U.S. Thugs and had his tattoo covered but stands by his friends who are still involved.

The "Metherell Affair" and resignation.
In 1999 Herzog’s cover page article in the weekly magazine "Haaretz" "Deconstructing the walls of Jericho" attracted considerable public attention and debates. In this article Herzog cites evidence supporting that "the Israelites were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel. Perhaps even harder to swallow is the fact that the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power, was at most a small tribal kingdom. And it will come as an unpleasant shock to many that the god of Israel, Jehovah, had a female consort and that the early Israelite religion adopted monotheism only in the waning period of the monarchy and not at Mount Sinai".
