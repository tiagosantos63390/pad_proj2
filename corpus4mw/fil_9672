Pomptinus was made one of Crassus' commanders following his order by the senate to defeat Spartacus and his army of slaves. When Gannicus and Castus, two of Spartacus' former commanders, split from the main force with around 12,300 rebels, Pomptinus and another commander: Quintus Marcius Rufus, were dispatched to defeat them. Two legions were placed under his and Pomptinus' command, and they succeeded in defeating both Gannicus and Castus somewhere in Cantenna, during the decisive battle in 71 BC. 
James Hunt of Comic Book Resources found the "Iron Man 3 Prelude" to be "dull and disappointing", calling the building of stakes around untouchable characters, like War Machine, a mistake, and criticizing the "rushed or phoned in" artwork. Noel Thorne, writing for What Culture, also found the prelude disappointing, calling it a "cheaply put-together cash-grab" and "not even remotely entertaining", and lamented the lack of actual connections with "Iron Man 3".

The year of 1954 was to be HMAS "Australia"'s last in service, with the ship conducting Royal and Vice Regal tasks as some of its final duties. In February and March, HMAS "Australia" served as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht "Gothic" during the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation tour. The cruiser was presented with the Gloucester Cup on 25 March as the ship "considered to be foremost in general efficiency, cleanliness, seamanship and technical training" during the year of 1953. As one of the ship's final duties with the Navy, "Australia" was tasked with transporting Field Marshal Sir William Slim, the Governor-General of Australia, along with his wife and their staff on a cruise around the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and the Whitsunday Passage. The voyage embarked on 4 May, and two days later "Australia" fired its 8-inch guns for the final time. While in the Coral Sea, a Dutch naval ship was discovered to be incapacitated off the coast of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, and was consequently towed by "Australia" to Cairns. McNicoll was later appointed a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch government for his rescue of the ship.
