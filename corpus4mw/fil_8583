Walton Place is a historic 1907 building at 75 Marietta Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. It was originally the Georgia Railway and Power Building. The architect was John Robert Dillon.
The runic text states that the stone was raised by two parents named Sigfastr and Ginnlaug in memory of their son Vinaman, and states that he died in a location listed in the text as buhi. While some scholars consider this location to be uninterpretted, others have suggested that it translates as Bógi and refers to a former Viking Age harbor in Gotland. The name Boge today survives for a Gotland synod. There are several other runestones which mention Gotland, including Sö 174 in Aspö, the now-lost U 414 in Norrsunda, U 527 in Frötuna, U 614 in Torsätra, DR 220 in Sønder Kirkeby, DR 259 in Fuglie, and possibly Sö 47 in Vålsta, where the text has been damaged. The runes aukinla-h on the stone, which translate as "and Ginnlaug," follow the rule that double consonants are represented with only a single consonant, even if one of the two consonants are at the end of one word and the second is at the beginning of the next word. The transliteration of the runic text for these words, auk| |kinla-h, shows word divisions and a separate k-rune for each of the two words.
