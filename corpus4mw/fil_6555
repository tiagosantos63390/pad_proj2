The tall earthfill embankment dam was completed by the Talent Division of the Rogue River Basin Project, impounding Dry Creek. Two canals were also built, diverting water from nearby Antelope Creek and Little Butte Creek. A boat ramp, four pit toilets, a picnic area, and a parking lot were also built. All but the boat ramp and parking lot have been removed due to excessive vandalism. There are three parking areas one on the north west side and two on the east side of the lake .
