Nykjær led the cars out at the start of Q1, Muller then went to the top of the times straight away while MacDowall was the first driver to go off the track. López was running as high as third during the session while for a brief time both Lukoil Lada Sport cars were inside the top twelve before Mikhail Kozlovskiy was bumped down the order by improvements for other drivers, notably James Nash and Marc Basseng. After lengthy repairs, Huff left the pits in time to do one flying lap which was only good enough for 14th, putting him out of qualifying. Valente was the only SEAT driver to get through to Q2 when Basseng was displaced by Nash while López was the only BMW driver to do so.

In 1939 Williams married William Anthony Hill, social worker, who, according to an article in "Ebony" magazine, "Ceramics by Tony Hill," (Vol. 2, Nov. 1946, pp. 3–35) became known as one of the best ceramists on the West coast. In 1941, they moved to Los Angeles, California. Together they did many cultural things together such as organize an exhibit for the art of Jacob Lawrence, the first formal exhibition of its kind in Los Angeles; and one for Charles White. When Katherine Dunham brought her troupe to L.A. from Chicago, Williams put together a road tour for her. When Waters went on a road tour for "Mamba’s Daughter", Waters hired her as her assistant. Waters convinced the producers to offer Williams the part as her understudy.
