Jagaciak was born in Poznan, Wielkopolska, Poland and comes from an athletic family. Her dad coaches athletes from Wielkopolska, and her sister, Anna Jagaciak (who was recently announced to be Poland's best long jumper), competes in long jump and triple jump. If she weren’t modeling, she would probably be training like her sister. Monika and her family live in Mosina, a township of just 12,107 surrounded by national park about 20 km south of Poznan. In her spare time Jagaciak enjoys playing sports and drawing. Despite Jagaciak's busy career she considers education very important and her mother, Marlena, claims Monika is a good student and does very well at school.
