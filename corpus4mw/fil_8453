Wright later suggested forming a new Loftus Road plc, including both QPR and London Wasps, on the Alternative Investment Market. A month later, Ray Wilkins left the club by mutual consent after a board meeting when he wanted money in an attempt to sign 34-year-old Ghana skipper Abedi Pele as well as being pushed to retire from his playing career. Ex-Arsenal caretaker manager Stewart Houston took over the reins with former Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch as his assistant.
"Wapuskanectes" was first named by Patrick S. Druckenmiller and Anthony P. Russell in 2006 and the type species is "Wapuskanectes betsynichollsae". The generic name is derived from "Wapuska", Cree language for "a body of water with whitecaps on it" and also it is the etymology of the Wabiskaw Member, in which the holotype was found, and "nectes", Greek for "swimmer". The specific name honors the late Dr. Elizabeth "Betsy" Nicholls, curator of marine reptiles at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, for enduring influence on research in Mesozoic marine vertebrates.
