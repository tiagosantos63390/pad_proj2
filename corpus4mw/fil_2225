Clare married Jane Hogan in 1966 and they had seven children together.
Previously failing in modern country and rock formats, the current format was adopted in the mid-1980s under the leadership of Ned Horton. Since then, the format has been "tweaked" on numerous occasions. 
Paris Grey (born Shanna Jackson, November 5, 1965, Glencoe, Illinois, United States) is an American singer, most known for her work with the Detroit-based techno-music producer Kevin Saunderson, as Inner City.

The gong ageng (Kromo Javanese meaning large gong, ngoko is gong gedhe) is a musical instrument. It is the largest of the bronze gongs in the Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestra and the only large gong that is called "gong" in Javanese. Unlike the more famous Chinese or Turkish tam-tams, Indonesian gongs have fixed, focused pitch, and are dissimilar to the familiar crash cymbal sound.
A small hairpin RNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a sequence of RNA that makes a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of shRNA in cells is typically accomplished by delivery of plasmids or through viral or bacterial vectors. The promoter choice is essential to achieve robust shRNA expression. At first, polymerase III promoters such as U6 and H1 were used; however, these promoters lack spatial and temporal control. As such, there has been a shift to using polymerase II promoters to regulate expression of shRNA. shRNA is an advantageous mediator of RNAi in that it has a relatively low rate of degradation and turnover. However, shRNA is disadvantageous in that it requires use of an expression vector which can pose safety concerns.

The W-71 nuclear warhead was a US thermonuclear warhead developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and deployed on the LIM-49A Spartan missile, a component of the Safeguard Program, an anti-ballistic missile(ABM) defense system briefly deployed by the US in the 1970s. The warhead was designed to intercept a cloud of incoming enemy warheads after their carrying missile's boost phase, at altitudes comparable to low earth orbit where there is practically no air, an environment which permits the passage of essentially all of the X-rays generated by the nuclear explosion. As part of the Safeguard ABM program the W71 was to serve as the first line of defense and as a complement to the other Safeguard missile-warhead pairing, the Sprint missiles enhanced neutron radiation warhead, the W66.
