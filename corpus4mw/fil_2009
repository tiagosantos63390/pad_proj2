Figuig consists of seven different communities (Ighermawen in South Oran Berber dialect) which are: At-Wadday, At-Amar, At-Lamiz, At-Sliman, At-Annaj, At-Addi, Iznayen. A community territory is called an "Agram", which is the word some local Berbers use to describe themselves in their tongue; plural "Igramawan". The communities are usually made up of a fortified group of houses. Many Agrams are designed with defensive measures like watch-towers and heavy doors on the main entrances, which are closed at night, as well as a mazelike layout, called an "Abrid" (meaning "pathway" in Berber), which makes navigation for unwanted intruders extremely difficult.

The goal of life history theory is to understand the variation in such life history strategies. This knowledge can be used to construct models to predict what kinds of traits will be favoured in different environments.

The key to life history theory is that there are limited resources available, and focusing on only a few life history characteristics is necessary.

Murolo is known not only as a singer, but as a composer, scholar and collector of the music; his collection of twelve LPs, released in the 1960s, is an annotated compendium of Neapolitan song dating back to the twelfth century and is the "Bible" for those interested in performing or simply learning more about the music.
