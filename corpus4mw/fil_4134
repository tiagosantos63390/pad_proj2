The most influential of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose "Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells" series has sold in excess of 2 million copies, being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary — and later writers have deviated to a greater or lesser extent from this blueprint — Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Far Eastern Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 2 of Wainwright's work.

Homewood reached the Football League referees List in 1966. Just two years later he was senior linesman to Leo Callaghan in the FA Cup Final between West Bromwich Albion and Everton at Wembley. Four years after that he was appointed a FIFA referee.†
He then moved up in weight and took on WBA Super Flyweight title holder Martin Castillo in 2005, but lost a decision. Morel was scheduled to fight Z Gorres for the interim WBO bantamweight title on November 14, 2009, but after the latter's last fight, he (Gorres) suffered a major injury that delayed his boxing career, so the fight was called off. He then returned to the ring against Gerry Penalosa February 13, 2010; That ended in a win for Eric Morel, lifting the interim WBO bantamweight world championship. He then deafted Juan Jose Beltran December 11, 2010 as an 2-0 record since his return. His next and latest match was against Luis Maldonado April 1, 2011; That now has his record at 3-0 since his return from injury.
Today's South Side is mostly a combination of the former Hyde Park and Lake Townships. Within these townships many had made speculative bets on future prosperity. Much of the South Side evolved from these speculative investments. Stephen A. Douglas, Paul Cornell, George Pullman and various business entities developed South Chicago real estate. The Pullman District, a former company town, Hyde Park Township, various platted communities and subdivisions were the results of such efforts.
Beck's skull was severely fractured, either by the blow or the impact of a bullet fragment, raising doubts about what happened. Pieces of his skull were recovered eight feet (2.4 m) from the body. County Attorney Forrest Hughes questioned the truthfulness of Day's statements, made at the coroner's inquest on April 9 and also in interviews with reporters (which accounted for the differing claims about why he had obtained the pistol), and raised the possibility that Day had argued violently with his wife shortly before he drove their guests home over attention she had paid Beck. Both he and Sheriff Ben Dancy claimed that Beck, shot in the back of the head, could not have been facing Day as claimed by Day when struck with the gun. The Army assigned a board of three officers stationed at Post Field to attend the inquest, investigate the circumstances, and report their findings to the Secretary of War. Their report included information from a woman attending the gathering that while Beck was sober, Day may have been intoxicated, questioned why Day had driven home guests who lived only a block away, and why Day had struck Beck with the barrel of the gun instead of the butt.
The church was allowed to remain open after presenting a plan of action to address critical areas, including congregational growth, fundraising and management improvements. The archdiocese would review its status after 18 months. A documentary film about the protest entitled "Shake the Devil Off" increased publicity for the church's efforts to survive.

The realignment resulted from Canwest Global Communications's acquisition of Western International Communications (WIC) in 2000. In most involved markets, the acquisition gave Canwest Global independent stations that were integrated into either Canwest's Global Television Network or the newly formed CH television system; in one case, a CTV-affiliated station (CFCF-TV in Montreal) was sold directly to CTV to become an owned-and-operated station (O&O) of the network. In Vancouver, however, the acquisition gave Canwest Global one of the most lucrative prizes in the entire country: control of CHAN-TV (channel 8, more commonly known as "BCTV"), the market's CTV affiliate and highest-rated television station.

The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth-charges were expended over a 5 hour period.
The young league got off to a difficult start in the decade as a scandal broke with Kickers Offenbach president Horst Gregorio Canellas putting forward evidence of players being bribed to affect the outcome of games. Allegations were that a number of clubs, including Bielefeld, Hertha, Schalke, and Köln, were involved. The scandal caused a disastrous loss of confidence in the Bundesliga and game attendance plummeted. Investigations by the DFB led to the banning of many players, although most of these sentences were commuted. Arminia Bielefeld, identified as the club central to the scandal, was stripped of all points they had earned during the 1971–72 season and then relegated to the league below.
The 18th century witnessed three major changes in the production of Shakespeare's plays. In England, the development of the star system transformed both acting and production; at the end of the century, the Romantic revolution touched acting as it touched all the arts. At the same time, actors and producers began to return to Shakespeare's texts, slowly weeding out the Restoration revisions. Finally, by the end of the century Shakespeare's plays had been established as part of the repertory outside of Great Britain: not only in the United States but in many European countries.

"P. i. subniger" is similar in size to "P. i. rhodesianus". The male of this subspecies has a dark green back which becomes brown or black in the rear of the back, with whitish spots. In males from Trelawney, Zimbabwe, their backs are uniform red, also with whitish spots. The tail and throat are orange (though the throat can also be yellow or white), while the chest and belly are black.

Gosia Dobrowolska, who had newly arrived in Australia, auditioned for the lead and impressed despite not knowing any English. However she struggled at a reading of the script and the role was given to Megan Williams instead. Then there was a delay in financing which put the film back a year. Dobrowolska improved her English and impressed the director and producer in a play she was appearing in; Williams was let go and Dobrowolska was cast. (Williams later sued and the matter settled out of court.)
