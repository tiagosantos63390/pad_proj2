The Incan Empire spread across the north western parts of South America between 1200 and 1573, ruled over by a monarch addressed as the "Sapa Inca", "Sapa", or "Apu". The civilization emerged in the Kingdom of Cusco, and expanded to become the "Ttahuantin-suyu", or "land of the four sections", each ruled by a governor or viceroy called "Apu-cuna", under the leadership of the central "Sapa Inca". The empire eventually fell to the Spanish in 1533, when the last king, Atahualpa, was captured and executed on 29 August. The conquerors installed other Incan kings– beginning with Atahualpa's brother, Túpac Huallpa– and the line continued in this manner until the death of Túpac Amaru in 1572.
