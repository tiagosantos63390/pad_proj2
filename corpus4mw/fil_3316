Miyoshi died in 1964 of a heart attack. His grave is at the temple of Honcho-ji in Takatsuki, Osaka, where his nephew was chief priest.
He wrote songs and poems in several newspapers and journals, of which several were put to music by Willem De Mol, such as "Lentelied", "Ik ken een lied", "Droeve tijden", and "Bethlehem". They were published in one volume in 1873. In 1874, he was awarded for a minnelied (E: romantic song) by the Antwerp Chamber of rhetoric, "De Olijftak" (E: Olive branch). In addition he wrote "Uit het hart"', "Liederen en gedichten" (Dendermonde and Leiden, 1875); "Liederkrans uit de Loverkens" van Hoffmann von Fallersleben, with his own music (Ghent, 1877); "Leven, lieven en zingen" (Ghent, 1879), "Naar wijd en zijd" (1905, put on music by François-Auguste Gevaert). A now relatively unknown song of him is "Mijn Vlaanderen heb ik hart'lijk lief", on lyrics by Theofiel Coopman. He was buried in Oudenaarde, where the "Gentiel Antheunisplein" is named after him.


A gritty, hard-faced Northern Irish woman who, to the amazement of her son John, played by Kevin Trainor, is delighted for him and herself when he comes out as gay. Even though he does not want to be treated any differently, she obsesses over his sexuality, inviting him to give her fashion advice, look at pictures of men in magazines while he was trying to watch football, visit one of her friends, and go on a gay parade — much to his embarrassment. The phrase she frequently uses is "Have you heard about our John? He's a gay man now".

The increasing post-war traffic in Stockholm coupled with the introduction of the metro system in the 1950s, resulted the demolition of the cast iron bridge followed by six years of provisional bridges succeeding each other.
