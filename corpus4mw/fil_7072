One of the main FODH events is the annual golf classic held in May each year in Castlewarden Golf Club. FODH also raises funding through membership fees and has made this funding available to county teams for training related activities.

In addition, FODH organises buses to take Dublin hurling supporters to matches around the country and a cash incentive is made available for clubs to organise a supporters’ bus to certain games.
