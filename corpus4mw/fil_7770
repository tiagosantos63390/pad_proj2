Biography.
Yarington was the author of two tragedies, one of which tells of the murder of Mr Beech, a chaundler in Thames Street, and his boy, by Thomas Merry, the other of a young child murdered in a wood by two ruffians, with the consent of his uncle. They were printed for Matthew Law, and were sold at his shop in Paul's Churchyard near St. Augustines Gate at the sign of the Fox, 1601. Nothing has been discovered concerning Robert Yarington. In Henslow's Diary (ed. Collier, pp. 92–3) it is said Haughton and Day wrote a tragedy called ‘The Tragedy of Thomas Merry.’ This was clearly on the first subject of Yarington's play. The next entry in the Diary refers to ‘The Orphan's Tragedy’ by Chettle, which was apparently never finished. This would seem to be the second subject of Yarington's play.
