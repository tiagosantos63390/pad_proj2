While the settings, continuities and plots of the games are unrelated to each other and vary greatly, there are many common elements and themes which tie them together. The first is a common theme of harmful interference by the mythos deities in the affairs of humans, and those humans' choosing whether to accept or challenge the predetermined fates given to them. Tetsuya Nomura defined the underlying story theme as "a battle of the gods that lies behind each tale and gives it inspiration in a different way." The second unifying factor is the structure of the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" universe, which is divided in two: the mortal world (the land of the living) and the Unseen Realm. The games share the same mythology, interpreted differently and referred to in varying degrees for each of the game worlds.


The Agua Tibia Research Natural Area (ATRNA), located within the wilderness, comprises of Bigcone Douglas-fir – Canyon Live Oak forest. The area was set aside for the study of this forest type in the Peninsular Range province and with emphasis on forest succession, long-range ecological changes and the effects of resource management practices. Bigcone Douglas-fir ("Pseudotsuga macrocarpa") is a relict species and is endemic to Southern California. This population on the ATRNA is unique for its relatively great age, size, genetic purity, placement near the southern extent of the species' range, and for its remoteness and lack of disturbance by man. Other notable plants in the research area are Laguna linanthus ("Linanthus orcuttii ssp. pacificus") and Hall's monardella ("Monardella macrantha ssp. hallii"). Both are listed as 1B by the California Native Plant Society's Rare Plant Program.
The Austrian Criminal Code previously specified 18 as the age of consent for male homosexual sex in which the other partner was aged 14–18, while no equivalent provision existed for heterosexual sexual conduct; this was Section 209 of the Criminal Code. In November 1996, an amendment was put before the Austrian Parliament to remove Section 209; but the vote ended in a draw, and the amendment failed to pass. In July 1998, a similar amendment was put forward; it was voted down by the conservative majority. Section 209 came into force when homosexuality between males became legal in 1971.

David Sims of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode an A- / B+, calling it "perfectly good but just a little more forgettable than the stone cold classics season five opened with," including "some very memorable moments." Sims notes that much of the episode "makes George look like a fool."
