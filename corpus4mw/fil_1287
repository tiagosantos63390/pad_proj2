The chain primarily acquires common brand-name goods whose manufacturer is willing to sell them at a loss following overstocking or discontinuation, operating closeout stores similar to Building 19, Big Lots, and Christmas Tree Shops. Ocean State Job Lot also has many new items (not closeout or overstocked products) that they use to fill their shelves, that they restock on a regular basis. 

The reports uncovered by Kan's team revealed that, after the report about the possibility of contamination, untreated blood products were recalled by the Japanese importer. However, when the importer tried to present a report to the Ministry of Health, it was told that such a report was unnecessary. The Ministry claimed that there was a "lack of evidence pointing to links between infection with HIV and the use of unheated blood products." According to one official, "we could not make public a fact that could fan anxieties among patients" [J.E.N].

Figures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are "cult wagons" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect. There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a "leaf crown" — two flattish rounded projections, "resembling a pair of bloated commas", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.
The liberalization process of the 1990s changed some parameters such as the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution functions of incumbent utilities in order to foster a competitive wholesale market or, as in the cases of large exporters like Quebec and British Columbia, to comply with Order 888 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other U.S. market rules. Most provincial governments still maintain a strong financial stake as operators in the electrical markets.

The name Ayabaca, also written as Ayavaca, derives from two Quechua roots: "aya", related to "death", but also to "immortality"; and "huaca" connected to "sanctuaries" and "sacred places". Some local monographs have limited its meaning to that of "grave and ancient tomb of the dead" ("tumba de muertos"), considering possible links between this designation and the findings of bones and primitive weapons near the zone where the Spaniards gathered the native population in 1571, when they founded the first "Pueblo de Indios de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Ayavaca" or "Ayavaca Vieja". Under this supposition, such bones and weapons would be the "remains of hordes fallen in combat against the expansionist advance of the Incas".
