On the first day of public operations, at 3.40pm, car no. 20, operating a Wherstead Road - Railway Station service, derailed at a set of points at the top of Princes Street.

Within a half hour of the accident, 9 trams were backing up around the Cornhill area. Eventually, car no. 24 was deployed to help with car no. 20 and together with car no.8, the derailed tram was brought back onto the tracks. The whole event caused much excitement to the public and many were watching the scene.
