Pannonian Croatia is a name given in historiography to the succession of medieval early Slavic polities located in the southwestern parts of the former Roman province of Pannonia between the fall of the Avar Khaganate starting in the 790s, and the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the 890s. They were mostly under Frankish suzerainty, part of Frankish Pannonia, and are known from Frankish primary sources.

The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Tim Stack of "Entertainment Weekly" named it as one of his favourite episodes of the series, calling it "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did "USA Today" Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." Mark Perigard of the "Boston Herald" went further in his praise, deeming "Grilled Cheesus" "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions during the course of the episode. Raymund Flandez of "The Wall Street Journal" felt that "Grilled Cheesus" succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in "a nuanced, atypical episode of "Glee" that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect."

Blackarachnia (To Silverbolt): ""Oh, it's no legend, Jo-Jo. Eons before Maximal or Predacon even existed, your ancestors, the Autobots, launched this ship containing their finest heroes. It was attacked by Decepticons and crashed here on Earth. When it" (the volcano the "Ark" was lying in) "explodes in 1984, our ancestors will awaken and start the Great War.""

He was engaged in drawing pictures after for a while when he was 14 years old, and one day he found a little electric guitar which was given as a present by his dad a long time ago behind a chest and he then started playing it. At that time, his parents led him to listen to pops and hard rock music from the 60s to 80s. On the other hand, he preferred to listen to alternative rock and electronica / ambient and tried to play those songs everyday by copying them simply by watching them.

Kent was in the 20s deputy chairman in the Norwegian Authors' Union under chairman Ronald Fangen. Kent was among those who reacted when Sigurd Hoel and Helge Krog in 1930 received scholarships from the union. Kent and others were of the opinion that Krog and Hoel could not receive any money since the statutes of the union said that the receivers should not "belong to movements that are in conflict with morality or the on Christianity founded order of society". Kent, who Helge Krogh referred to as Ronald Fangen's "astral body", was an outspoken participator in this idelogical conflict that ended with Hoel, Krog, Arnulf Øverland, Francis Bull and A. H. Winsnes leaving the union.
