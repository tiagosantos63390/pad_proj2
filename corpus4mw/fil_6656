Background and production.
During 2004, authors Horia Gârbea, Valeriu Butulescu, Mircea Ghiţulescu and Mircea Petean traveled to Vietnam, on the invitation of the Vietnamese Writers Union. Their experience in the Far East produced the collective travel account "Drumul spre Nghe An" ("The Road to Nghe An"), published the same year. Also in 2004, Gârbea premiered his "Cleopatra a şaptea" ("Cleopatra VII") with the Andrei Mureşanu company of Sfântu Gheorghe, published a new work for the stage—"Hotel Cervantes", and oversaw the publishing of Editura Limes' "Repetiţie fără orchestră" ("Rehearsal without an Orchestra"), an anthology of prose pieces by young Romanian authors. His own work also included the 2005 essay collections "Arte parţiale" ("Partial Arts") and "Bridge în 41 de povestiri vesele" ("Contract Bridge in 41 Cheerful Stories"). Gârbea was made Knight of "Meritul Cultural" order through a 2004 presidential decree. In March 2005, as head of the Bucharest Association of Writers, he set up the Romanian version of France's literary festival "Le Printemps des Poètes" ("Poets' Spring", known locally as "Primăvara poeţilor"). A month later, during the "Romanian Comedy Festival", his play "Leonida XXI" was staged by the Comedy Theater.
