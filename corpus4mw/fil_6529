From as far back as 1904 there was rising concern about the West Indian Flamingo populations. During the 1960s the Bahamas National Trust formed the Inagua National Park. The Inagua National Park is the where the world's largest breeding colony of West Indian Flamingoes can be found. Forty years ago this flamingo species made a comeback from the brink of extinction to a colony of over 50,000 birds. The park has contributed to increasing bird populations in nearby islands such as Mayaguana, Acklins, Crooked Island, Cuba, and Andros. In 1997 the park was designated a wetland of international importance. It is also known as a bird watchers' paradise as it was designated an Important Bird Area.

It hits and misses, but at least it floats." Buzz McClain of "All Movie Guide" wrote that the director's nontraditional style might not work for everyone, apecially in consideration of Dominique Swain's performance, but added that there was no question that the film's conclusion will generate conversation and introspection for those who understand it.
