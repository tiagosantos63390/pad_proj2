The youngest case of BVVL was documented by Voudris (Voudris 2002). The patient was a male infant who had a normal birth and neonatal period, healthy parents and no family history of neurological disorders. This male was the youngest patient in literature who featured severe symptoms of BVVL syndrome. At twelve months, the patient developed an upper respiratory infection and demonstrated both stridor and harshness of voice. Three weeks later, the child showed apnea, suspension of external breathing, and was artificially ventilated for three days. However, aside from slight bilateral facial weakness the patient showed a relatively normal neurological examination with normal motor and sensory nerve conduction. At fourteen months, the child developed dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, and was then fed with a catheter. Between fifteen and eighteen months, the patient showed progressive neurological degeneration with symptoms such as paralysis of extraocular muscles responsible for eye movements, bilateral facial palsy, weakness of jaw muscles and tongue, and sever weakness of upper extremities with disappearance of tendon reflexes. Between eighteen and twenty-one months, the child became lethargic and unresponsive, lost interchange between sleep and awakening, and no longer reacted to any visual or auditory stimulation. The patient died at twenty-one months of respiratory failure. This particular case of BVVL syndrome differs from others in that the patient had severe symptoms at an unusually early age. While no autopsy on the child was performed, researchers are hoping that the unusual symptoms in this case and other similar cases can be used to provide a link between BVVL syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease (Voudris 2002).
