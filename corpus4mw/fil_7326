GÃ¼nter Asser (born 26 February 1926, Berlin) is a professor emeritus of logic and mathematics at the University of Greifswald. He has published numerous volumes on philosophers and mathematicians. His own research was in computability theory.
After he left JP Morgan Indonesia in April 2008, Gita established his own company, Ancora Capital, an investment company specializing in natural resources, including mining. Admittedly, not many people would have the courage to walk away from such a high position at a world-class company like JP Morgan. The well-built man said that he had planned to leave the company since the middle of 2007, because he knew that a financial crisis would occur in the US that would have a global impact that would extend to Indonesia.
