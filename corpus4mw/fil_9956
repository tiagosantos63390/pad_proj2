In 1998, South Africa created the Domestic Violence Act to try and protect those who are being abused or might be forced into a situation that could become harmful in the future. At this time, the biggest assistance to women came from the Protection Order that derives from the Domestic Violent Act. The Order allows the courts to stop an abuser from continuing abuse. The collaboration process between representatives of the Department of Justice, Safety and Security, Health Education, Welfare, Correctional Services and the National Directorate for Public Prosecution was a delaying factor that slowed down the process of changing the policies. Within the first year of the Domestic Violence Act being created, 1,696 applications were submitted for protective orders. In a report done by the United Nations Division of the Advancement of Women they found that on the protective orders that women were able to fill out, the forms were only available in two out of the eleven languages that are spoken in South Africa. Other reforms that were created were to sentence mandatory minimal time for specific types of rape under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1997.
