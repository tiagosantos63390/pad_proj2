IATS traces its roots to the 1970s when in order to halt the brain-drain of talented ministers to North America SDA colleges within the Inter-American Division (IAD) territory (nations and islands in and/or bordering the Caribbean Sea, including Mexico and the Guianas) began forging relationships with Andrews University in the United States to offer graduate programs in the area. These relationships grew into a formal arrangement between the IAD and the SDA Theological Semenary at Andrews University that allowed ultimately ten campuses within the IAD territory to offer graduate degrees in Theology and Religion. The program was very successful but the costs were prohibitive, so in 1996 IAD voted to formally wean itself off Andrews University by establishing IATS which graduated its first ministerial doctorates in 2007 and won full accreditation in 2011.

The Joint Air Training Scheme was a major programme for training South African Air Force, Royal Air Force and Allied air crews during World War II. An Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) gave a recruit 50 hours of basic aviation instruction on simple trainer aircraft and pilots who showed further promise went on to training at a Service Flying Training School (STFS). The Service Flying Training School provided advanced training for pilots, including fighter and multi-engined aircraft while other trainees went on to different specialties, such as wireless, navigation or bombing and gunnery training. In South Africa, the Elementary Flying Training School and Service Flying Training School curricula were grouped together and known as "Training Air Schools". Thirty-five such air schools were established in South Africa for Commonwealth pilot and crew training. The facilities were under SAAF control and were distributed throughout the country with training being conducted using a wide variety of aircraft (depending on the purpose of the training). The training scheme was in operation from 1939 to 1945. 
When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined "New Horizons" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as "Horns of Hattin" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as "Ein Gedi" (1950s), "Sheep of the Negev" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.
Miranda is sent on a voyage by Prospero in a boat created by an upturned umbrella. Whilst she is travelling the books symbolise seagulls as the weather turns. Miranda is caught in a storm of ideas as words from "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights" appear on the pixel screen as Ziya Azazi, a contemporary whirling dervish dancer, becomes the eye of the storm on top of the orrery. Birdy sung "Bird Gerhl" as the sway pole dancers signed the lyrics and David Toole did a contemporary dance. Toole and Miranda flew across the stadium, with Miranda arriving back on the book stage.

In 1823, the Gossler family sold the property to Wilhelm Schröder, who was married to Salomon Heine's eldest daughter Fanny. Their grandson Otto Nanne owned the property from 1872 to 1906, when he sold it to the factory owner August Herbst. Due to financial difficulties, Herbst sold the property to the Hamburg government in 1928–29. Since 1937, the manor house has been listed as a cultural heritage site. The park had by 1957 been reduced to 4800 m². The manor house was officially given the name "Stavenhagenhaus" in honour of the poet Fritz Stavenhagen in 1962, with a ceremony presided over by Helmut Schmidt. However, Stavenhagen has no association with the house's history and the building is also referred to as the "Frustberg" or as the "Tiefbrunn House". The name "Gossler House" has also been used. The building is used for cultural events such as concerts.
