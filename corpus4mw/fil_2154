Although it did not evoke the critical fervour later albums did, "Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark" became a seminal record within popular music. Musician Vince Clarke has cited the album as one of his primary influences, with "Electricity" being the track that moved him to pursue a career in electronic music. Rock group ZZ Top, with whom OMD shared a studio on a 1980 edition of BBC2 show "The Old Grey Whistle Test" while promoting "Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark", became loyal fans upon hearing the material and would play the record over their PA system prior to concerts. ZZ Top's fondness of the album also led to the band borrowing McCluskey's distinctive on-stage routine â€“ dubbed by the BBC's Stuart Maconie as the "Trainee Teacher Dance".
