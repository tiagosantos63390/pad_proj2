Haitian filmmakers making a name for themselves in Hollywood include Jean-Claude La Marre, director of "", and Romane Simon.
Under mildly acidic or neutral conditions, oxoammonium salts such as [TEMP=O]+[BF4]- are able to oxidize allylic, benzylic, propargylic, or aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones. Secondary alcohols react faster than primary ones, although selectivity is low. A convenient experimental protocol allows for recycling of the oxoammonium salt.

Most of these changes involved conferences in the top Football Bowl Subdivision, with all of the FBS conferences, as well as the ranks of FBS independents, either gaining or losing football members. Most notably, after significant attrition and replacement, the old Big East Conference split into football-sponsoring and non-football sponsoring conferences in 2013 with the establishment of the American Athletic Conference and the new Big East Conference, while the Western Athletic Conference became the first Division I FBS conference to drop football since the Big West Conference did so in 2000. Two other conferences (the Mountain West Conference and Conference USA) discussed a merger, but due to likely revenue losses resulting from specific provisions in NCAA rules, these plans were abandoned.
A carbonyl group can be reduced to the alcohol or the oxygen atom can be removed altogether, a process called deoxygenation. 
The lack of silver cash seems to be the pressing problem that Nova did not anticipate. He certainly did not bring much cash with him, having also expected to sell Portuguese goods in India to raise it.
Metal-based oxidants are often more efficient than dioxirane oxidations in the catalytic mode; however, environmentally unfriendly byproducts are typically generated. In the realm of asymmetric epoxidations, both the Sharpless-Katsuki. and Jacobsen epoxidations surpass asymmetric dioxirane oxidations in enantioselectivity. Additionally, enzymatic epoxidations are more enantioselective than dioxirane-based methods; however, operational difficulties and low yields are sometimes associated with enzymatic oxidations
