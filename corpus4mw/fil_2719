A honeycomb mirror is a large mirror usually used as the primary mirror in astronomical reflecting telescopes whose face is supported by a ribbed structure that resembles a honeycomb. The design provides sufficient rigidity for ultra-high precision optics while reducing the weight of the mirror.

The term may also refer to mirrors made up of a coordinated set of individual hexagonal mirrors.
