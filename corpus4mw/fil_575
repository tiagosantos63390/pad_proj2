In summer 1978, Morgenthau wrote his last co-authored essay titled "The Roots of Narcissism," with Ethel Person of Columbia University. This essay was a continuation of Morgenthau's earlier study of this subject in his 1962 essay titled "Public Affairs: Love and Power," where Morgenthau engaged some of the prominent themes which Niebuhr and Tillich were struggling with at that time in their respective academic positions in New York City. Morgenthau was significantly taken by his encounter with Tillich's book "Love, Power and Justice" that he wrote a second essay related to the book concerning power and justice. More recently, Anthony Lang has managed to recover and have published one of Morgenthau's extensive course notes lectures on Aristotle as a stand-alone book on this subject which Morgenthau taught while at the New School for Social Research during his New York years. The comparison of Morgenthau to Aristotle has been further explored by Molloy in his recent essay on Aristotle and Epicurus.
In February 1972 "Taney" was shifted back to the east coast and was homeported at Norfolk. From 13 to October 22 of 1972 she served on "Ocean Station Hotel". From October 28 to November 17, 1972 she served on "Ocean Station Delta". From January 26 to February 15 and April 17 to May 7, 1973 she served on "Ocean Station Bravo". As the ocean stations were decommissioned during the early 1970s due to advances in radar and electronic navigation, "Taney" was assigned exclusively to the only station still operational: "Ocean Station Hotel" off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. Fitted with a special storm-tracking antenna housed in a distinctive bulbous dome fitted atop her pilot house, "Taney" deployed seven times yearly, conducting 21 deployments off the coast. This last ocean station had been established to track storms threatening the middle states on the east coast which had often struck without warning. Eventually, the use of more sophisticated storm-tracking satellites and radars rendered this station obsolete. Hence, "Ocean Station Hotel" was closed down in 1977 and the "Taney" gained the distinction of being the last Coast Guard cutter to serve on an ocean station.
Previously, metformin was recommended as treatment for anovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome, but in the largest trial to date, comparing clomiphene with metformin, clomiphene was more effective than metformin alone. Following this study, the ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored Consensus workshop do not recommend metformin for ovulation stimulation. Subsequent randomized studies have confirmed the lack of evidence for adding metformin to clomiphene.
