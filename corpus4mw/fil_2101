The roundhouse has since been converted into industrial units but since April 1987 the adjacent wagon repair shed has been used to service diesel locomotives, local passenger trains, and wagons used for china clay traffic. The turntable has been retained to turn the preserved steam locomotives that still visit Cornwall on special main line workings. Goods traffic is still sometimes loaded at St Blazey in the marshalling yard adjacent to the depot.

In 1998, management negotiated with the TOTE of Tasmania who held an unused FM license and launched a second FM to join Triple T. The new station, MAGIC 107FM, based upon market research, was targeted at 40 to 65 year olds with a music format of the 50s, 60s, and 70s coupled with John Laws in the morning shift. This strategy was to compliment Triple T's focus on an under 40 market. In the initial radio survey, MAGIC 107FM captured over one third of the Hobart radio listeners and dominated its target market.

Brighton is Charlottetown's most prestigious neighbourhood, buffered from the city somewhat by bucolic Victoria Park. Comprising houses over 100 years old as well as newer developments from the 1970s to the 1990s, Brighton is roughly delineated by Colonel Gray Drive, North River Road, and Brighton Road. Houses with proximity to Charlottetown Harbour and the North (Yorke) River tend to be more prestigious with their large lots along a former cottage area. Mature trees line newer developments along Queen Elizabeth Drive, Edinburgh Drive, Inkerman Drive, and Prince Charles Drive. Older Victorian homes are situated in Old Brighton which is a smaller neighbourhood east of North River Road, being bounded by McGill Avenue, North River Road, Ambrose Street, and Brighton Road.

The Nikonos is often referred to as a rangefinder camera, but in truth it is a scale focus camera as there is no rangefinder. The viewfinder is used purely to compose the shot, and to display exposure information. Focus is set with an outsized dial mounted on the left side of the lens barrel (as seen from the operator's point of view), and the aperture is set with a dial mounted on the right. For many beginners, this meant some confusion over estimating distances underwater, since refraction makes objects appear 25% closer than they actually are. Strangely, Nikon's approach was to assume that the user did not make the correction, so the distance markers on the lens are offset to compensate for it. Thankfully the Nikonos wide-angle lenses have ample depth of field, so these discrepancies are often not a noticeable problem.
