It must in truth be said though it may not accord well with self-conscious individuality and self-conceit, that no possible native force of character, and no depth or wealth of originality, can lift a man into absolute independence of his fellow-men, and no generation of men can be independent of the preceding generation.

The original Londonderry Waterside Station was opened on 29 December 1852 by Steven Alfred John Campbell, a well known banker at that time. It closed on 24 March 1980, but the station building remains intact. A new station of the same name replaced the larger terminus in 1980, after services were reduced and track layout was severely rationalised. The line consisted of a single jointed track with loops at Castlerock and Coleraine stations.

The earliest found settlements in Igboland date back to 4500 BC in the central area, from where the majority of the Igbo-speaking population is believed to have migrated. The northern Igbo Kingdom of Nri, which rose around the tenth century, is credited with the foundation of much of Igboland's culture, customs, and religious practices. It is the oldest existing monarchy in present-day Nigeria. In southern Igboland several groups developed, of which the most notable was the Aro confederacy. Igboland was part of the Southern Nigeria colony of the British Empire and was amalgamated into modern-day Nigeria in 1914; the nation gained independence in 1960. Shortly afterwards Igboland was involved in its biggest war during Biafra's movement for secession, which eventually ended in 1970 when this area rejoined Nigeria.
During the same period, Ramin also appeared in two concerts of "Les Misérables" (as Marius), and one of "Jesus Christ Superstar" (as Simon Zealotes, and a featured singer in "Superstar"), as well as being involved in several theatre workshops.
In the film, the character of "Father" gets considerably more screen time. She initially does not seem very important; she is simply a higher official, whereas "Mother" is the direct authority over John Steed (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (portrayed by Uma Thurman). Her importance to the plot becomes obvious near the end of the movie, when it is revealed that she is a traitor in league with the villain, Sir August de Wynter (portrayed by Sean Connery).
In addition to his opera work, Luxon also developed a reputation as a concert-giver and recitalist with an unusually broad repertoire, ranging from early music through Lieder to contemporary song, music hall and folk music. He has also been recognised for his work rehabilitating parlour songs from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, particularly in partnership with Robert Tear. He has made more than a hundred recordings, many featuring early and mid twentieth-century British songwriting and folksong arrangements by composers such as Britten, George Butterworth, Percy Grainger, Ivor Gurney, Roger Quilter, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gerald Finzi and Peter Warlock. His regular accompanist between 1961 and 1999 was the pianist David Willison.
