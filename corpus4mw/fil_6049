The 2008 Danish Figure Skating Championships () were the Danish Figure Skating Championships of the 2007-2008 figure skating season. Skaters competed in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies singles, and ice dancing on the levels of Senior, Junior, Novice, and the pre-Novice levels of Debs, Springs, and Cubs for the title of national champion of Denmark. Not all disciplines were held on all levels due to a lack of participants.
However, John Rentoul from the UK's "The Independent", who describes himself as an "ultra Blairite with a slavish admiration for Tony", and John Rosenthal, from the conservative Pajamas Media, both denounced the film because it was made with financial support from the German government. Rentoul also launched a scathing attack on Polanski describing the winner of Berlin's Silver Bear as "propaganda" and a "Blair hating movie". Still, what the critics did not explain was that although the production company, Elfte Babelsberg Film GmbH, received €3.5 million from the German state, any major film production within Germany is entitled to apply for financial assistance from the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF); the grant is not required to be repaid.

Air-cooled Whirlwinds were lighter and more reliable than liquid-cooled engines of similar power, since a liquid cooling system added weight and required extra maintenance. Thanks to these advantages Whirlwind engines were used widely and were built in large numbers. Licensed copies were produced by manufacturers such as Continental Motors, Hispano-Suiza, and Shvetsov. The Whirlwind's success led to the development of other air-cooled radial engines throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s and these gradually eclipsed most liquid-cooled aircraft engines.
Their design failed to match the monumentality of the Heinrichshof opposite (destroyed in World War II, and in 1955 replaced by the Opernringhof). Criticism from both the Emperor and a press campaign against the pair of architects described the disappointment of the Viennese public and suggested that the building was merely a half-success. After the street level in front of the opera house was raised by a metre, the opera was described as the "sunken chest" and - in analogy to the military disaster of 1866 - "the Königgratz of Construction".

Since breeding and biting habit differ considerably between species, species identification is important for control programmes.
