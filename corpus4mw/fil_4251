The Aitkin County Courthouse and Jail, in Aitkin, Minnesota, United States, serves as the county seat of Aitkin County. The building is actually the second courthouse for the county. The first courthouse was built in 1888, but in 1920, a grand jury reported that the building was dangerous and "falling apart". After difficulties securing financing, the county commissioners approved a plan for a new courthouse, which was finished in 1929. The design mixes Beaux-Arts architecture and Moderne elements. The interior features marble wainscoting, oak woodwork, terrazzo floors, and stained glass skylights.
The former office is located on the northwest corner of the building, in the southwest portion of the park. One of the park's internal access roads, to the south, provides access to a parking lot on the west. Beyond it, Morton Avenue is 300 ft (100 m) to the south. On the west is a large octagonal children's swimming pool, basketball court and tennis courts along Delaware Avenue (U.S. Route 9W).

The cynical demands of the bad emperors and the beneficial ones of the good emperors are described at great length by the historians of the empire, such as Tacitus.
