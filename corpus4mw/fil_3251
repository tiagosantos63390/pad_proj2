Beech forests ("Fagus sylvatica") are found in the mountain layer of the Iberian Eurosiberian region from 800 to 1500 metres up. The soil is cool, as often chalky as siliceous (rich in silica), and nearly always acidified by rain. The layer is characterised by the beech tree. The beech tree projects a deep shadow, and so its dense foliage usually excludes other woodland species. It therefore has little undergrowth. 
Produce, due to a lack of warehouses and silos, needs to be commercialized quickly. According to data from Conab, only 11% of the warehouses are located on farms (while in Argentina the total is 40%, in the European Union it is 50%, and in Canada it is 80%). This forces farmers to rely on third party services to store produce. Seasonal factors, such as the loss of crops and currency exchange losses, DE capitalize the producer, who cannot invest in the building of silos. With silos he could negotiate his production in more favourable conditions, not only at harvest time. The Brazilian situation has led to calling trucks "silos on wheels".
