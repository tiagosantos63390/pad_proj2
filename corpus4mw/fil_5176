On 25 July, the Abkhaz separatists met with Matthew Bryza, the U.S. deputy assistance secretary of state. Bryza attempted to convince the Abkhaz side to participate in talks in Berlin the following week without any preconditions. However, Abkhaz officials rejected the talks. Later on that day, Abkhaz leader Sergey Bagapsh did not rule out Sokhumi's possible participation in a meeting of the Group of Friends in Berlin. Abkhaz foreign minister Sergey Shamba also said that Sokhumi was not "in principle" against the Berlin meeting, but that did not mean the resumption of direct talks with Tbilisi. Russian ambassador to UN Vitaly Churkin said that Russia was against immediately summoning a meeting of the UN Secretary General's Group of Friends on Georgia to discuss the Abkhaz conflict. The availability of a peace plan from an unbiased Western actor would steer the process away from the Russian-controlled formats, so Russia had encouraged Sukhumi to thwart the German-proposed consultations.

A company's ability to deliver an experience that sets it apart in the eyes of its customers serves to increase the amount of consumer spending with the company and, optimally, inspire loyalty to its brand. "Loyalty," says Jessica Sebor, "is now driven primarily by a company's interaction with its customers and how well it delivers on their wants and needs." (2008)

Initially founded in 2000 as one of the new ABA's charter franchises, the Detroit Dogs quickly became one of the league's better teams. Their first coach was Detroit's own George Gervin, a star with the original ABA in the 1970s. The Dogs finished with a 24–20 record and the best record in the Eastern Division, facing the Tampa Bay ThunderDawgs in the first round of the playoffs. After trailing for most of the game, Detroit rallied and won 117–112, moving to the second round. In the semifinals, Detroit handled the Indiana Legends 119–105, and advanced to the new ABA's first championship game against the heavily favored Chicago Skyliners, owners of a 31-12 record. Detroit would get off to a fast start and easily defeat the Skyliners, 107v91. Gee Gervin (George's son), who led the team during the regular season, won the first-ever ABA Championship Game MVP Award.
