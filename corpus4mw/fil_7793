The Milwaukee Public Museum is one of the leading museums of human and natural history as well as the first museum to create full-sized dioramas. It originally shared a space with Milwaukee Public Library. In 1950 the architectural firm Eschweiler and Eschweiler proposed designs for a new building to house the museum. The building was built in the 1960s when Stephan Borhegyi, then museum director, led the effort to finish the project and incorporate advanced museum theories to the interior spaces. The building's architects commissioned Marshall Fredericks to create a sculpture for the museum's entrance facade. "Woodland Indian and Whistling Swans" symbolizes the Great Lakes area. "A Woodland Indian, ready to release an arrow from his bow, pauses in awe before the beauty of nature as seen in the flight of swans." Although Fredericks was paid $50,000 for the artwork, the mounting of the work was problematic because of the sculpture's weight and size. The city had to negotiate with contractors before the sculpture was finally installed.
During the 18th century, the hereditary chiefs (Shum-Gulti) of Deqi Tesfa ruled from Areza. They faced much opposition during the 19th century from the Seraye. During the reigns of Emperors Tewodros II and Yohannes IV, the chiefs sought to enchance their authority by forming family alliances through marriage with the Tsazzega and the Hazzega. However, by the 1880s they lost control to the Ras Alula and sided with the Italians, who established a colonial post at Areza in 1890. The town grew in regional importance in the 1940s when the building of a dirt road to Barentu saw it develop as a market town.
