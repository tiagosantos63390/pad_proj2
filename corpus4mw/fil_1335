At the height of chaos and violence during the early Bersiap period of the Indonesian revolution Sjahrir published an epoch-making pamphlet named 'Our Struggle'. ""Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack."" Sol Tas.
Đoàn Minh Huyên, a native of Sa Đéc (now Đồng Tháp) province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, came to be known as the "Buddha Master of Western Peace" ("Phật Thầy Tây An") during the cholera epidemic in 1849, which killed over a million people. Huyên was reputed to have supernatural abilities to cure the sick and the insane. His followers wore amulets bearing the Chinese characters for "Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương", a phrase that became identified, retrospectively, with the religion practiced by Huyên, and the millenarian movement associated with the latter.
