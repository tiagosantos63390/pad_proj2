Born in Naples on last decade of the 19th century, Salvatore Papaccio early began to demonstrate his predisposition to the music. During the years and with the strengthening of his voice, his success began to spread. He debuted in Teatro San Carlo in 1908 under the direction of Maestro Campanini in the role of the sailor in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Since then on, he had the opportunity to participate to numerous works, 123, directed by illustrious directors like Pietro Mascagni, Tullio Serafin, Riccardo Zandonai and Arturo Toscanini. One anecdote about him is the one of the visit of the monarch of the empire of Rising Sun Hirohito in Naples, where Papaccio began to sing the songs of his city in the reception of the admiralty, and obtaining a standing ovation.
As noted above, the cartridge was designed to be 100% compatible with the M4 platform. This included the buffer, buffer spring, GI magazines, many aftermarket .223/5.56 magazines, and magazine well. In .223/5.56 caliber, cartridges stack in a staggered (double stack) fashion. However, with the much larger .458 SOCOM, rounds "single stack" without any modification to the standard GI magazine feed lips or follower, making it the most versatile and cost effective big bore offering in an AR-15 platform. A standard 20-round 5.56mm NATO magazine can hold seven .458 SOCOM rounds and a standard 30-round 5.56mm NATO magazine can hold nine .458 SOCOM rounds.
