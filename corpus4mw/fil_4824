Kiu is an ancient female of Asian heritage. She has gone farther than most of her age in abandoning any concern with humanity. Apart from carrying out her missions, she is interested in power, luxury, and recreational sex. To her humans are a disease on the face of the Earth. In "The Children of the Company" she uses her charisma to start a religious cult bent on mass suicide, which is in fact a large-scale test of one of the plagues created by Labienus and his cronies.

In August 1954, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned his conviction on the grounds that he should have been tried in Maryland and that the cross-examination about his alleged homosexuality inappropriately prejudiced the jury. By that time, the sixty-nine witnesses called to the stand at his trial had been scattered all over the country; General Wainright had even died. As a result, the Department of Justice doubted that Provoo could be retried. He was indicted again by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Baltimore, Maryland, with Judge Roszel C. Thomsen presiding. However, Thomsen threw out the case in March 1955, stating that Provoo's right to a speedy trial under the U.S. Constitution's 6th Amendment had been abrogated. The prosecution appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which on October 17, 1955 unanimously upheld the lower court's dismissal.

They deserted to Emeric, King of Hungary, and eventually the two continued on to Palestine. After arriving at Jaffa, they took part in King Amalric II of Jerusalem's expedition into Galilee. Amalric rewarded Guy's service by arranging his marriage to "la dame de Saete" (the lady of Sagette), Helvis of Ibelin, the widow of Reginald, Lord of Sidon (which the French called "Saete"/"Sagette"). He exercised the regency of Sidon on behalf of his minor stepson Balian until 1210, probably when Balian came of age. Guy then assisted at the coronation of John of Brienne as King of Jerusalem that year.
