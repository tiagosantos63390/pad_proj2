An unnova is an event at the end of a star's life when it collapses on itself without the emission of large numbers of particles and energy. This is unlike the mechanisms of high energy release during a nova or supernova. The centre of the unnova would form a neutron star or black hole, similar to that of a supernova. Matter from the outer part of the star may fall relatively slowly into the centre of the unnova, in which case low-energy gamma radiation may be emitted.

As a member of the Young Conservatives Committee on Extremist Infiltration, in 1983/84 he continued to support the Final Report and the Panorama programme after Pedley's Chairmanship term ended. Despite pressure from the Party chairman, John Selwyn Gummer, Guthrie remained steadfast . The Times reported: "… in an astonishing intervention which would have been wholly unwelcome to the party chairman,' he referred to "the strange antics," of Conservative Central Office in "orchestrating" an attack against the Panorama programme. Guthrie warned Gummer, the Party was fostering the impression that it would not act on extremist infiltration. "It is therefore disturbing to see that some have seen fit to undermine our work in this area by challenging the basis of this programme." Guthrie warned the Party chairman, that the Young Conservatives would continue to speak out on the issue of extremists."We are not prepared to see the strange antics of Central Office deflect us from our commitment to the Report or its recommendations. If it transpires that we are the only section of the Party that is prepared to place principle over convenience in this respect, then we are fully prepared to accept that role."

Under P&O Stena Line "P&OSL Canterbury" continued the Dover-Calais route, on 11 August 1999 she was hired out on charter to the Daily Mail to enable passengers to view the European Solar Eclipse. This era was not without fault, with further bow door problems in April 2000 and flooding of a machine room in May 2001 causing her to be taken out of service for repairs both times. In October 2002, P&O bought Stena Lines' 40% share in P&O Stena Line and the vessel was speedily renamed "PO Canterbury", then returning after her winter refit as the "Pride of Canterbury" for a short service in Spring 2003. In Mid-May 2003, "Pride of Canterbury" was laid up in Dunkirk awaiting disposal, thus ending her 13 year career on the Dover-Calais route. She was sold to GA Ferries of Greece in October 2003 but did not depart until March 2004.
