Stallan was born in Glasgow in 1967, and was educated at the University of Strathclyde, graduating in 1988 under Professor of Architecture Gordon Benson (of Benson & Forysth Architects). Stallan first worked with Glasgow architect Peter McGurn on major community and urban regeneration projects across the West of Scotland before joining architects RMJM in 1988 as International Design Principal and European Design Director. In 2012, Stallan established Stallan-Brand with architect Alistair Brand after leaving RMJM.
The museum also includes prints, drawings and sculptures from the private collection of art by Luigino Rossi: the original sketches of Lacroix and Lagerfeld, the reproductions of prints by Andy Warhol, and sculptures by Allen Jones and Daniel Spoerri.

FSCV in combination with carbon-fiber microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of neurotransmitters, hormones and metabolites in biological systems. Initially, FSCV was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active biogenic amines release in chromaffin cells (adrenaline and noradrenaline), brain slices (5-HT, dopamine, norepinephrine) and in vivo in anesthetized or awake and behaving animals (dopamine). Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of 5-HT, norepinephrine, adenosine, oxygen, pH changes in vivo in rats and mice as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in fruit flies.
