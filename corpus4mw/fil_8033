In 2008, Kipnis batted .371 with 14 home runs and 73 runs batted in. He finished second in the league with 24 stolen bases in 28 attempts. Kipnis primarily played center field, but played all outfield positions and second base; he batted leadoff part of the time. In 2008, Kipnis became the second Arizona State player to win the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Pacific-10 Conference Newcomer of the Year. (Teammate Ike Davis earned the award two years earlier.) Kipnis was named second-team All America by the ABCA and named third-team All-American outfielder by "Baseball America". In May 2008, he won the Pacific 10 Player of the Week award. In June, the San Diego Padres drafted Kipnis during the fourth round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. However, Kipnis opted to remain in college at Arizona State, becoming the seventh-highest player in the draft who chose not to sign. He decided not to sign with the Padres because he felt he hadn't fully matured and accomplished everything in college. Regarding Kipnis' success, Arizona State coach Pat Murphy observed: "I love that kid. He's tough as nails, and really hard on himself." Moreover, Paul DePodesta, San Diego Padres front office assistant and former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager, described him as "a pesky player who is a very tough out, hitting the ball to all fields and running the bases aggressively ... plays very hard and is surprisingly strong." In the summer of 2008, Kipnis played for the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape Cod League, a collegiate summer baseball league located on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

To create the artwork Inuzuka, who is visually impaired, worked with students of the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired to create "Circle". With the goal of providing ISBVI students with a place to gather at the ARTSPARK, the youth contributed ideas about the design of the artwork, leading to the tactile nature and recordings in the piece, which were also created by the students. A groundbreaking was held on June 5, 2004 at the ISBVI to celebrate the creation of what would become the Nina Mason Pulliam Sensory Path, where Inuzuka's installation would be at the end of the path. On creating the artwork Inuzuka sought to "do something with texture so the blind children could feel it".

Inglis was born c. 1731, the fourth son of Sir John Inglis and his wife Anne, the daughter of Adam Cockburn. He embarked on a naval career, at first joining the 40-gun under Captain George Brydges Rodney, in 1745, and the next year went with Rodney to the 60-gun . Rodney carried out several successful cruises, capturing four ships from a French convoy in June 1747, and fighting under Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke at his clash with Desherbiers de l'Etenduère's fleet at the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre on 25 October 1747. Inglis saw action on both of these occasions. "Eagle" was heavily engaged with the French 70-gun "Neptune" in the latter engagement and suffered considerable damage. She was paid off in August 1748 on the conclusion of the peace, and Inglis was left without a ship. He remained unemployed until 1750, when he joined the 50-gun , at that time under the command of Captain Francis Holburne. Inglis's biographer, P. K. Crimmin noted that like Inglis, Holburne was a lowland Scot, and that Inglis may have been benefiting during this time from a network of patronage that included John Cockburn, Inglis's uncle and a Lord of the Admiralty between 1727 and 1732 and again during 1742 and 1744, and Sir John Clerk, a friend of the family with considerable political influence.
