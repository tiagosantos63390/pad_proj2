The main purpose of this project is to reduce campus greenhouse gas emissions. The new hot water system will reduce UBC's district heating system energy use by 24 per cent. Furthermore, it will reduce UBC's greenhouse gas emissions by 22 per cent. To save money on operational and energy costs and to advance clean energy research and development opportunities. For example, it will save 4 million a year in operational and energy costs. Moreover, to facilitate a long-term target of eliminating the use of fossil fuels on campus by 2050.

The aviation club Båtsfjord Flyklubb was established to build an airfield. The club was able to secure sufficient funding to start construction in 1972. The airport opened in May 1973 with a gravel runway, which was extended to the following year. The aviation club was initially responsible for operations in cooperation with the municipality and Norving. Although the airport was initially planned mainly to serve air ambulance flights, Norving also started air taxi services. The airport lost money on operations and struggled to cover its costs. Flights were flown on basis of customer ordered, at the times specified by the customers. This meant that to get reasonable prices a group would have to book a flight together. In 1975 the airline had 700 flights to the airport and transported 4000 passengers. From 1 January 1976 ownership and operations of the airport was taken over by the municipality.
