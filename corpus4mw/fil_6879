When the Arabs under Abu Ubaid's were making an expedition in the Sawad in 634, Rostam Farrokhzād sent Bahman Jadhuyih and Jalinus against him with a force from the powerful Wuzurgan class, who had units such as war elephants and the Zhayedan. Rostam is known to have to have told Bahman that: "if Jalinus returns to the like of his defeat, then cut off his head." Bahman, clashed with Arabs at Sawaw and successfully drove the Muslims back to Babylon west of the Tigris, and then drove them across the Euphrates, and camped at Qoss al-Natef on the east bank. Abu Ubaid camped across the river, and when he crossed the Euphrates on a floating bridge and attacked Bahman's army. Bahman then caught the Muslims with their backs to the river and inflicted a heavily defeat on them at the Battle of the Bridge. During the battle the army of Bahman had an advantage: the elephants in his army frightened the Arabs horses, and which later resulted in the death of Abu Ubaid. The bridge was then broken by an Arab, and around 4,000 Arabs died by drowning and many others were killed by the Bahman's forces. Al-Muthanna managed to flee from the bridge and rally 3,000 Arab survivors, however, some of them fled back to Medina. Bahman did not pursue the fleeing Arab army. In 636 during the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah Bahman was killed by Qa’qa ibn Amr in in revenge for the death of Abu Ubaid and the others killed at the Battle of the Bridge.
