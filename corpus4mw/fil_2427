Nomad runs into a group of settlers in the town of Meridian. Damnil (Anthony Zerbe), a local landowner, and his gang are attacking the town to gain a monopoly on the local water supply. Nomad stays at a local farm owned by Kasha (Lisa Niemi) who is Nomad's love interest (and Swayze's real life wife). Nomad teams up with Kasha's foreman Tark to oppose Damnil and his bullying tactics. After Tark determines that he has outlived his use to Kasha as a foreman and protector, he proceeds to go into town and get very drunk. He has a very one sided fight with Nomad as he comes to retrieve him from the bar. Sho and some of Damnil's men show up in town where Sho and Nomad have a brutal staff fight. Tark gets in the way and is stabbed in the abdomen by Sho and dies. The boy Jux is taken by Damnil's men and Nomad has his wounds treated by Kasha. Nomad proceeds to Damnil's farm to retrieve Jux and Kasha and have the final showdown with Sho.
During the latter half of the 19th century, the push dagger also enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Britain and Central Europe, particularly in Germany, where it was called the "Stoßdolch" or "Faustmesser", meaning "push-dagger" and "fist-knife", respectively. The weapon is thought to have been introduced there in the mid-1800s by foreign sailors visiting North German ports. German cutlery makers began to manufacture domestic versions of the design, often set in nickel-silver mountings. The "Stoßdolch" was sold primarily as a self-defence weapon for travellers, salesmen, and others who required a compact, concealable weapon. Push daggers continued to be sold in Britain and Europe through the end of the 19th century, when the combination of more effective police forces and the availability of inexpensive small handguns caused a substantial decline in sales and usage of push daggers and other types of specialised fighting knives.

The rudiments of the style were established by Oomph! on their second album, "Sperm" (1994), and by Rammstein with their first album "Herzeleid" (1995). In those days, Oomph!'s biggest influence were groove metal bands such as Prong, Pantera and Sepultura. Rammstein, which in turn were strongly inspired by the music of Oomph! and Laibach, is the style's most famous and successful practitioner. Neue Deutsche Härte is especially successful in continental Europe; Rammstein have sold nearly four million records in Germany, while accumulating gold and platinum records in Sweden, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Finland and the Czech Republic.
