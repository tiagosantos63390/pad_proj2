In Finland, there was no real theatres and no native actors in the beginning of the 19th century; theatre was played by travelling Swedish theatre troupes touring the country. Between 1813 and 1827, the first theatre was run in Turku by the troupe of K.G. Bonnevier, who had attained a permission from the Russian emperor, and built a simple theatre house in the city. She was discovered when selling tickets and candy to the visitors of the theatre, Silfvan was hired in this troupe, and was seen as a natural dramatic talent. In 1825, she played the leading part in Friedrich Schiller's Mary Stuart (play) opposite Inga Ã…berg as Elizabeth Tudor.
