Vicryl (polyglactin 910) is an absorbable, synthetic, usually braided suture, manufactured by Ethicon Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson. A monofilament version is also made for use in ophthalmic practice. It is indicated for soft tissue approximation and ligation. The suture holds its tensile strength for approximately two to three weeks in tissue, and is completely absorbed by hydrolysis within 56–70 days. Vicryl and other polyglycolic-acid sutures may also be treated for more rapid breakdown ("Vicryl Rapide") in rapidly healing tissues such as mucous membrane, or impregnated with triclosan ("Vicryl Plus Antibacterial") to provide antimicrobial protection of the suture line.
In the Year 2889 is a 1967 apocalyptic, science fiction, made-for-television film about the aftermath of a future nuclear war. American International had commissioned low-budget cult film auteur Larry Buchanan to direct and produce the film as a colour remake of Roger Corman's "Day the World Ended" (1955).
