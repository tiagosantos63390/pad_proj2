Episode 13A - "Backward Bugs".

Local residents claim that arms trafficking, car thefts, and drug trade have "always existed" in San Fernando, but in 2004 Los Zetas arrived at the area. They began to establish themselves little by little, and local residents remember witnessing convoys of "luxurious trucks entering and leaving the city, going into stores and buying goods." They claimed that before the Mexican Drug War (which began in 2006) and the rupture between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas (which happened in early 2010), the cartels "would not kidnap or steal. In fact, they would always pay for the goods they bought in stores." They would live outside the city limits in ranches. However, then they began to live in city neighborhoods, and the "people started to get involved with them." A local resident claimed that many families had "at least one member involved in the drug trade," and that is why he claims many in San Fernando were scared when the violence erupted. In addition, below is a quote of advice from his mother, who gave instructions on what to do when one is kidnapped by the cartels:
Legislative elections were held in the German Democratic Republic on 14 November 1971. 434 deputies to the Volkskammer were elected, with all of them being candidates of the single-list National Front. 584 Front candidates were put forward, with 434 being elected. The allocation of seats remained unchanged from previous elections.
