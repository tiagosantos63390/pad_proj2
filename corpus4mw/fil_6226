O'Hara was born in Dalkey, then in County Dublin. An outside left, he played for Dundalk in the League of Ireland alongside Jim Higgins, before the pair joined Birmingham City in 1949. Both players went straight into the starting eleven, making their First Division debuts on 19 November 1949 in a 1–1 draw at home to Fulham. There was strong competition for places on the wing, from Johnny Berry, Harold Roberts and Jackie Stewart among others. O'Hara played only once more that season, and four times in the Second Division in 1951, before moving on to non-league club Hereford United. He then returned to Ireland to play for Sligo Rovers and Drumcondra before coming back to England with Lockheed Leamington and a second spell with Hereford United.
