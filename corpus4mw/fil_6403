Barlow's first major success came in 1966 when she made her debut at the Komische Oper Berlin as Donna Anna in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Don Giovanni". The production was directed by Walter Felsenstein and was broadcast live on German television. That performance was recently released on DVD in January 2009 in a boxed collection with several other operas directed by Felsenstein at the Komische Oper between 1956-1976. She sang several more leading roles with the company during the 1966-1967 season to great success. Barlow next worked as a principal soprano at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden from 1967-1969 and then at the Opernhaus Zürich from 1969-1970. Her major successes at these houses were portraying heroines from operas by Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, and Giuseppe Verdi. She made her first opera appearances in the United States in 1969 as the title role in Verdi's "Aida" with the Portland Opera and at the San Diego Opera as Elizabeth in "Tannhäuser".

The Gregorian reform contained two parts: a reform of the Julian calendar as used prior to Pope Gregory XIII's time and a reform of the lunar cycle used by the Church, with the Julian calendar, to calculate the date of Easter. The reform was a modification of a proposal made by Aloysius Lilius. His proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97, by making 3 out of 4 centurial years common instead of leap years. Lilius also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the moon when calculating the annual date of Easter, solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform.
