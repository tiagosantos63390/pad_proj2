Early career.
Fatimih was born in 1828 in Mazandaran and was generally known as Mahd-i-'Ulya. A first cousin of Bahá'u'lláh, Fatimih was married at fourteen to an influential cleric several decades older than she was. She seems to have been widowed shortly afterwards, perhaps aged sixteen. It is reported that Bahá'u'lláh's aunt implored him to wed his widowed cousin and he reluctantly agreed to do so. They married in 1849 in Tehran and she had six of Bahá'u'lláh's children, of whom four survived to adulthood. She was said to have been very jealous of and harboured great enmity towards `Abdu'l-Bahá. She died in 1904, and was later labelled a Covenant-breaker.
