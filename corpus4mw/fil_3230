There are five small lakes or tarns, called the East Tarns, grouped together on the eastern part of the plateau just to the north of the summit of Tarn Rigg Hill. The West Tarn, meanwhile, lies at the north-western end of the summit plateau at , and is difficult to find on the almost flat top because it nestles in a slight hollow, even though it can be seen from the trig point. It may be located from the latter by following the western rim of the plateau, overlooking Sedbergh, until two cairns point the way to the tarn.
Historically, "restaurant" referred only to places that provided tables where one sat down to eat the meal, typically served by a waiter. Following the rise of fast food and take-out restaurants, a retronym for the older "standard" restaurant was created, sit-down restaurant. Most commonly, "sit-down restaurant" refers to a casual dining restaurant with table service, rather than a fast food restaurant or a diner, where one orders food at a counter. Sit-down restaurants are often further categorized, in North America, as "family-style" or "formal".

Until 1945, the city of Coventry was represented by a single Member. Population growth meant that it had grown to 89,001 electors at the time of the 1935 general election, and in the 1939 electoral register it had 87,487 electors. The County Borough of Coventry had also expanded its boundaries in the late 1930s, taking in an additional 66,425 electors. Two nearby divisions of Warwickshire had exceptionally large electorates: Nuneaton at 112,503 and Tamworth at 118,131. Accordingly the area was included in the Schedule to the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944 as abnormally large constituencies to be divided by the Boundary Commission before the first post-war general election.
