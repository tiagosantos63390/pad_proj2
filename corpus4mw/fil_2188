Some sources report that after the death of anti-king Herman of Salm, the bishops Hartwig of Magdeburg and Burchard of Halberstadt persuaded Egbert to turn against the king and himself aim for the crown. Whatever the case, Egbert soon broke with his new allies, probably because of unkept promises. Bishop Hartwig's submission to the king isolated Egbert completely.

Mikveh Israel Cemetery was originally a private burial ground for the family of Nathan Levy, whose ship, "Myrtilla" was long reputed to have transported the Liberty Bell from England to Philadelphia in 1752 (though the "Hibernia", captained by William Child, is more likely to have transported the bell). In 1738, one of Levy's children died. Rather than bury the child in unsanctified ground, he applied to John Penn (chief of Pennsylvania's proprietary government at that time) for "a small piece of ground" with permission to make it a family cemetery. This property was at the corner of 9th and Walnut Streets, the present site of the Walnut Street Theatre. Two years later, Nathan Levy secured a larger plot from the Penn family at the present location of Mikveh Israel Cemetery. This was meant to be a permanent burial ground for the entire Jewish community of Philadelphia. Levy was buried there upon his death in 1753.
As well as published works he was a successful TV writer with credits for "Coronation Street" and Hine as well as "one-offs" for the prestigious "Play for Today" slot on the BBC's main TV channel ("Michael Regan" and "The Vanishing Army"), two episodes for "The Man Outside" (Drama series, BBC 1972) and several plays in Thames TV's Armchair Theatre series.
