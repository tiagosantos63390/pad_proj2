In 2007, Goolsby and Kenn George, a former legislator and then the chairman of the Dallas County Republican Party, were sued for libel in the 192nd Texas District Court in Dallas by Goolsby's former Democratic legislative opponent, Harriet Miller. The suit contends that George and Goolsby filed a false voter complaint against Miller with the district attorney of Dallas County. Miller then claimed that the complaint was used in 2006 to attack her campaign and to suppress African-American voter turnout in District 102.

Osage is an ghost town in northwestern Colorado County in the U.S. state of Texas. The one-time settlement was situated on Harvey Creek near the junction of County Roads 205 and 208 a few miles to the northeast of Weimar. At the time of the American Civil War, the community was substantial enough to provide a company of soldiers to a Texas regiment in the Confederate States Army. A notable school flourished in Osage starting in the 1870s, but in that decade the railroad was built through Weimar instead. By 1900 the local commercial establishments had moved to Weimar and the town faded out of existence. In 2013 the area was sparsely settled.
