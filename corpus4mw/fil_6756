"Resistance 3" features an online 16-player competitive multiplayer component. It offers five modes: Team Deathmatch, Chain Reaction, Deathmatch, Breach, and Capture the Flag. It also includes a customizable progression system where players spend points earned by playing online to unlock customized loadouts that include various attributes. There is also a co-operative mode where players can team up to play through the story mode either online or split-screen. Gameinformer's podcast revealed that there would be no eight-player co-op as in "Resistance 2". The multiplayer maps are set in locations around the world, such as the Fort Lamy prison in Chad; the Seaside of Glamorgan, Wales, UK; Alice Springs in Australia; New York City in the United States; the Trainyard in Bogota, Colombia. Some of the locations these maps take place in are not included in the story mode.
