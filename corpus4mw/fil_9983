During the event, Dick Togo and Taka Michinoku successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against former four-time champions, Gedo and Jado and Hiroshi Tanahashi successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hirooki Goto.

Secure attachment is related to positive relationship qualities (e.g., satisfaction; commitment). Although it may seem counter-intuitive, long-distance relationships between securely attached individuals are perceived to be similar in relationship quality to relationships of securely attached individuals who are geographically close. Avoidant and anxious attachment style individuals who are involved in long-distance relationships perceive their relationship as lower quality than avoidant and anxious individuals in geographically close relationships. Commuter couples’ relationship quality are expected to differ based on the individuals’ attachment styles. Recently, research found that commuter couples who meet on a monthly base (i.e., meet more than once a month) relationship quality was influenced by the separation.
