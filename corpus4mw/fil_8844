After the forced extinction of religious orders, during the Liberal government, the monks left the convent, and the building began to serve the state in various forms, including prison, courts, finance offices, theatre and cinema, as well as cultural and sports associations and the municipal office buildings. Over time, it began to fall into ruin, with many of the internal spaces vandalized, windows and doors damaged, water infiltration through the roof and most of its artifacts transferred to expositions. It was finally classified as a "Property of Public Interest" under Decree 129/77, on 29 September 1977, but continued for several years to wait a budget to recuperate and restore its dependencies.
