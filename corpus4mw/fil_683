In convex geometry Carathéodory's theorem states that if a point "x" of R"d" lies in the convex hull of a set "P", there is a subset ′ of "P" consisting of "d" + 1 or fewer points such that "x" lies in the convex hull of ′. Equivalently, "x" lies in an "r"-simplex with vertices in "P", where formula_1. The result is named for Constantin Carathéodory, who proved the theorem in 1911 for the case when "P" is compact. In 1914 Ernst Steinitz expanded Carathéodory's theorem for any sets "P" in Rd.

On 17 December 1938 the New Swabia Expedition left Hamburg for Antarctica aboard the "MS Schwabenland" (a freighter built in 1925 and renamed in 1934 after the Swabia region in southern Germany) which could also carry and catapult aircraft. The secret expedition had 33 members plus the "Schwabenland'"s crew of 24. On 19 January 1939 the ship arrived at the Princess Martha Coast, in an area which had lately been claimed by Norway as Dronning Maud Land and began charting the region. Nazi German flags were placed on the sea ice along the coast. Naming the area "Neu-Schwabenland" after the ship, the expedition established a temporary base and in the following weeks teams walked along the coast recording claim reservations on hills and other significant landmarks. Seven photographic survey flights were made by the ship’s two Dornier Wal seaplanes named "Passat" and "Boreas". About a dozen 1.2 meter-long aluminum arrows, with 30 centimeter steel cones and three upper stabilizer wings embossed with swastikas, were air dropped onto the ice at turning points of the flight polygons (these arrows had been tested on the Pasterze glacier in Austria before the expedition). Eight more flights were made to areas of keen interest and on these trips some of the photos were taken with colour film. Altogether they flew over hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and took more than 16,000 aerial photographs, some of which were published after the war by Ritscher. The ice-free Schirmacher Oasis, which now hosts the Maitri and Novolazarevskaya research stations, was spotted from the air by Richardheinrich Schirmacher (who named it after himself) shortly before the "Schwabenland" left the Antarctic coast on 6 February 1939.

Mafiosi have protected a great variety of clients over the years: landowners, plantation owners, politicians, shopkeepers, drug dealers, etc. Whilst some people are coerced into buying protection and some do not receive any actual protection for their money (extortion), by and large there are many clients who actively seek and benefit from mafioso protection. This is one of the main reasons why the Mafia has resisted more than a century of government efforts to destroy it: the people who willingly solicit these services protect the Mafia from the authorities. If you are enjoying the benefits of Mafia protection, you do not want the police arresting your mafioso.
