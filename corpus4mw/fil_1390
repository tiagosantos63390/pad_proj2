In 1890, the land that now comprises Missouri City was advertised for sale in St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas as "a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer." Despite all the efforts to appeal to settlers from the "north", the first actual settlers came from Arlington, Texas - between Dallas and Fort Worth - in early 1894. Partially within Harris County, but mostly in neighboring Fort Bend County, the city boasts a large African American population. "Mo City", as it is sometimes called, has experienced significant "white flight". Most of this white flight has occurred in the northeastern portions of the city which are now predominantly black, and master-planned communities within the city such as Quail Valley and Lake Olympia boast significant white populations, and some of these communities have pockets of African-American and Asian-American residents. Sienna Plantation, an unincorporated community within Missouri City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, is culturally one with Missouri City.
