Parramatta finished second in the 1983 Premiership season, and opened the finals with a 30–22 win over Canterbury before being defeated by Manly-Warringah in the major semi-final, however the Eels defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final to qualify for another Grand Final against Manly. In the Grand Final Parramatta built a 12–0 half-time lead, which Brett Kenny extended after half-time and, with Cronin’s conversion, the Eels lead 18–0 and ultimately won 18–6. Parramatta’s third consecutive premiership was the first treble in the NSWRFL Premiership since St George’s domination of the 1950s and 1960s.
