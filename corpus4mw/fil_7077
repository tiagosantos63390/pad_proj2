The banded archerfish inhabits the Indo-Pacific and waters off northern Australia, and less frequently those on the southern coast of Australia. It can be found from India eastwards to the Philippine Islands, southwards to Australia, as well as in waters off the Solomon Islands and the Indonesian Archipelago. It has been observed as far east as the New Hebrides (now known as Vanuatu).


Approximately an hour before the crash, Stack allegedly set fire to his $230,000 house located on Dapplegrey Lane in North Austin. He then drove to a hangar he rented at Georgetown Municipal Airport, approximately 20 miles to the north. He boarded his single-engine Piper Dakota airplane and took off around 9:45 a.m. Central Standard Time. He indicated to the control tower his flight would be "going southbound, sir." After taking off, his final words were "thanks for your help, have a great day."

With the aircraft unable to complete the journey, the captain elects to return to Haneda airport, now suffering from severe weather conditions. The flight crew and ground controllers then have to work together to take the plane back home, win the cooperation of a "difficult" passenger, fly around adverse weather, and determine if the maintenance crew was at fault for the aircraft's failure.

The Calvinist Cadet Corps publishes "Cadet Quest" magazine seven times during a Cadet season — September/October, November, December, January, February, March, and April/May. The magazine is specifically for boys, ages 9–14. The magazine defines its purpose as "using stories, articles, news, humor, puzzles, games, and projects to encourage boys to be servants and leaders in their homes and communities." All Cadets can submit items which they request to be published in the "Cadet Quest".
