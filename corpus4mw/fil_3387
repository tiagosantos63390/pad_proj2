In 1869 the line was sold to the Narragansett Steamboat Company.

Diana Primrose ("floruit" 1630) was the author of a eulogy to the deceased Queen Elizabeth published as "A Chaine of Pearle, Or a Memoriall of the peerles Graces, and Heroick Vertues of Queene Elizabeth of Glorious Memory. Composed by the Noble Lady, Diana Primrose" (London, 1630). It is thought that this piece was written not only as a tribute to the 45-year reign of Elizabeth but as a criticism of the sometimes hot-headed King James, as well as a social criticism. The "Chaine" itself is made up of ten "Pearles" or short poems detailing virtues found in Elizabeth; some of these Pearles however are not qualities directly attributed to Elizabeth and thus it is considered that they may present a criticism of the then current ruler.
