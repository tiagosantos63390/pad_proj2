On May 24, 2005, Norfolk Southern was awarded the TRANSCAER National Achievement Award for 2004. TRANSCAER is an acronym for "Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response", which aims to promote emergency preparedness among first responders and communities for accidents that involve chemical releases. Part of the reasons for NS's selection for this award were the emergency preparedness training that the railroad held in 18 of the 22 states through which the railroad hauls hazardous materials.
In 1811 the 16-year old Baldwin was made an apprentice jewelry maker to the Woolworth Brothers of Frankford, Pennsylvania. Apprenticeship in these days was a virtually coercive relationship marked by long hours of labor and miserable compensation. In 1817, shortly before the fixed term of his indenture was completed, Baldwin moved together with his mother to the urban mecca of Philadelphia. There the budding jewelry maker was snapped up by the firm of Fletcher & Gardner, one of the leading jewelry manufacturers of the city.
Having arrived in Merseyside in 1976 (as a student attending City of Liverpool College of Higher Education), Julian Cope became involved in Liverpool’s emerging post-punk scene. His first band was Crucial Three, with two native Liverpudlians – Ian McCulloch (later of Echo & the Bunnymen) and Pete Wylie (who went on to form Wah!) – in which Cope served as bass player. Although Crucial Three would later develop a legendary status, it was essentially an extremely short-lived rehearsal and writing band which kick-started the trio’s individual ambitions.
In 2002, the London Institute of 'Pataphysics organised an exhibition based around the recreation of all the art works seen the film and presented the exhibition as if it were a retrospective of a real unknown artist called Anthony Hancock.
Since the 1980s, there was a division in the Nation, solidified with the formation of the Little Buffalo band. Steven Noskey led a council created in 2009. The Lubicon Lake Nation Council continued to be led by Chief Bernard Ominyak. On the week of July 23, 2012, Noskey notified the Canadian government that he was stepping down, leaving Ominyak as the sole chief for the nation. This leadership resolution was ratified in writing by the majority of Lubicon citizens.
The Nonsecure Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (abbreviated as "NIPRNet," but commonly written "NIPRNET"), but prevalently referred to as the "'Non-classified' IP Router Network," is used to exchange sensitive but unclassified information between "internal" users as well as providing users access to the Internet. It was replaced by "Sensitive but Unclassified IP Data." NIPRNet is composed of Internet Protocol routers owned by the United States Department of Defense (DOD). It was created in the 1980s and managed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to supersede the earlier MILNET. NIPRNET is the largest private network in the world. Over the last decades it has grown faster than the U.S. Department of Defense can monitor, which is why DoD spent $10 million in 2010 to map out the current state of the NIPRNET, in an effort to analyze its expansion, and identify unauthorized users, who are suspected to have quietly joined the network. The NIPRNET survey, which uses IPSonar software developed by Lumeta Corporation, also looked for weakness in security caused by network configuration. The Department of Defense has made a major effort over the last few years, to improve network security. The Pentagon announced it was requesting $2.3 billion in the 2012 budget to bolster network security within the Defense Department and to strengthen ties with its counterparts at the Homeland Security Department.
As the gears rotate they separate on the intake side of the pump, creating a void and suction which is filled by fluid. The fluid is carried by the gears to the discharge side of the pump, where the meshing of the gears displaces the fluid. The mechanical clearances are small— in the order of 10 μm. The tight clearances, along with the speed of rotation, effectively prevent the fluid from leaking backwards.

In 1968 the PRR merged with the New York Central Railroad, to form the Penn Central. A series of events including inflation, poor management, abnormally harsh weather conditions and the withdrawal of a government-guaranteed 200-million-dollar operating loan forced the Penn Central to file for bankruptcy protection in 1970. PRR operated under court supervision until 1976, when the Northeast Corridor rail line was transferred to Amtrak for use in passenger service, and the remaining lines were transferred to Conrail. Initially Conrail operated commuter rail service on its lines under contract to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. In 1979, the commuter lines were acquired by New Jersey Transit.

A series of plies of cord reinforces a tire. Without this, a tire would be flexible and weak. The network of cords that gives the tire strength and shape is called the carcass. Since the 1960s, all common tires have a carcass of cords of polyester, steel, or other textile materials, inlaid with several layers of rubber.
