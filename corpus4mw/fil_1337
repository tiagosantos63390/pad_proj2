Gypsy is one of the imprisoned heroes forced to fight on the behest of the Apokoliptan gods on Earth in the Dark Side Club. In "Final Crisis: Requiem", Gypsy is part of Martian Manhunter's funeral. She, along with several other heroes are telepathically compelled by the Martian Manhunter to recall Martian history. Later still, she is again accosted by Despero (off-panel). The villain then brings her unconscious body to Happy Harbor and fights Vixen's ragtag Justice League.
If a team manages to have the best overall record, yet fails to win either round, that team will play the winner of the second round in a playoff game, to face the winner of the first round in the Championship game. The games of the Championship round are all single-elimination matches, until the 1980s when the Championship game was expanded to a best-of-three series.
