On 23 November Leeds United requested that their 15-point deduction to be adjudicated by the High Court rather than the Football Association after having failed in two requests to the FA to set up an independent commission to review that decision. The Leeds Board Commented "In effect, the same individual confirmed his own earlier decision, There was no independent review." This request was however also rejected by the F.A. Leeds eventually served the Football League with a writ for the points deduction challenge to be heard in the high court however on the final day available to respond to the writ the Football League offered Leeds a closed doors arbitration hearing instead. The panel was made up of Peter Cadman, who had chaired past Premier League disciplinary commissions, Peter Leaver, the former Premier League chief executive, and chaired by Sir Philip Otton a High Court Judge experienced in football legal matters. Leeds accepted this and after the panel heard both sides of the argument between 16 April and 21 April 2008 they eventually returned a decision on 1 May. The decision returned denied Leeds any points return. Two of the main reasons given for the rejection by the three man arbitration panel include the impact of a reinstatement of any points on other teams near the top of League One and the delay in bringing the matter to arbitration. The Arbitration Panel released short and extended documents detailing the final decision.
