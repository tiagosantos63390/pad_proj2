A statement released by Apache Energy on 13 June 2008 said the company had sourced pipe and valves needed to repair the pipeline. Apache said it was increasing the number of staff on the island conducting integrity checks, with over 140 staff expected on site the following week. On 18 June, Apache Energy said it had commenced demolition and restoration of the damaged pipeline and expected this to be finished by the end of the following week. The pipe was already in Karratha and valves and fittings from the United Kingdom were expected to arrive in early July. Gas supply from the plant partially resumed in late August. By mid-October, gas production was running at two-thirds of normal capacity, with 85% of full output restored by December 2008.

The Bavarian Class PtzL 3/4 engines with the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("KÃ¶niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen") were rack railway locomotives whose cogwheel drive was designed for working on tracks with a Strub rack. In 1923 they were incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 97.1 ("Baureihe 97.1") in their numbering plan. The locomotives remained on their regular route between Erlau and Wegscheid until the closure of this rack railway in 1963. The last journey was on 5 January 1963. They were scrapped in April 1964 at Simbach am Inn.

Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade, the Netherlands abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912. In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.
