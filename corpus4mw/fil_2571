Recording.
In 2011 Andria Schur, the principal of Barbara Jordan, said that she was closing the auto-collision program at Jordan at the end of the 2010-2011 school year. Schur said that this was due to state budget cuts and because the school was "trying to shift to more 21st-century jobs." Schur suggested that students in the program instead enroll in Advanced Placement courses in art history and studio art. According to Mr. Gonzales, the teacher of the auto-collision program, if the program is eliminated, there will be no schools in HISD that will offer it. Gayle Fallon, the president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, said that HISD was trying to push the vocational programs into the domain of Houston Community College. Gonzales and some of his students attended an HISD board meeting, asking the board to make the steps to have the program saved. As of 2011 the school continues to offer automobile collision/repair courses.
