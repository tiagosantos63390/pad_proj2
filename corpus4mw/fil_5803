In his thoughtful and deliberative frame of mind, Baum was in favor of tolerance and against bigotry of all types; this is reflected in "Daughters of Destiny" and in other of his books. (For pertinent examples, see "Sky Island" and "Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea".) Yet he was not, and could not have been, a man with a mindset of modern political correctness. Most often when writing humorously (or attempting to do so), as with David the Jew in this book, Baum willingly exploited the ethnic and racial stereotypes that were current in his era. (See also "", "The Woggle-Bug Book", and "Father Goose's Year Book".)
During the 1930s the young Kramarenko listened to radio broadcasts about the deeds of Soviet airmen like Valery Chkalov and Georgiy Baidukov, and so decided to become a pilot. In the autumn of 1940 he began a flying course at the Dzerzhinskiy aeroclub, and as one of the 80 who graduated with the highest marks was offered the opportunity to become a military pilot. Kramarenko accepted and began military training on 1 April 1941 at Borisoglevsk aerodrome.
The pale olive or tan cap is initially convex before flattening, and measures or sometimes up to in diameter with a velvety tan surface. Occasionally the cap slits revealing yellow flesh beneath. The skin of the cap is very hard to remove. The pores underneath the cap are yellow, and bruise blue or green before fading somewhat. The stipe lacks a ring and is up to tall by wide. The spore print is olive-brown. A drop of ammonium hydroxide on the cap instantly produces a mahogany red reaction, which distinguishes it from some other similar species of the genus. The flesh is white and has little taste or smell.

Immediately after its introduction in 1974 the LGR broke the individual and team 10 metre air rifle world records. This record breaking made the international shooting union, known as the UIT back then, but today the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), decide to reduce the size of the 10 metre air rifle target to its current dimensions.

There is no consensus on who should get an anal Pap smear. Some individuals recommend that all men and women who have anal sex should have an anal Pap smear performed regularly. Some recommend it for all men who have had sex with men, for all individuals with HIV and anal warts, or for all individuals with a history of anal warts. Cost-effectiveness studies have reported conflicting conclusions, due to incomplete understanding of the natural history of anal HPV infection and lack of clarity of the efficacy of interventions. An informal survey of local infectious-disease doctors in southeast Michigan suggested that few know where to send patients for an anal Pap smear. The procedure is very simple, and can be easily performed in any doctor's office with a little training.

In 1912, Johann Huf founded a carpentry workshop in the small village of Kr√ºmmel in the Westerwald. A year later, the enterprise moved to Hartenfels. In 1948 his son Franz Huf took over management of the enterprise, and enlarged it to a supra-regional provider of carpenter's works, e. g. churches in the Rhineland, the large post administration office in Bonn (1950) as well as the German and Arabic pavilions at Expo 58. The so-called "Huf Fachwerkhaus 2000" was designed in 1972 together with the architect Manfred Adams. The principles of this construction are still the standard in all Huf houses. Since 1996, grandsons Georg and Thomas Huf have led the company and brought the products to the world market. They also established "The Huf Haus Village", a collection of Huf family houses, which represent the possibilities of building Huf houses.
Due to the relatively steep inclines, tunnels and a viaduct, the Queensbury Lines were also known as "the Alpine Route".
