Both the terms "spiritual crisis" and "spiritual emergency" (Grof, 1989) share in the common recognition that: a) non-ordinary experiences and psychological disturbances (e.g., anxiety and panic) often overlap; b) Western medicine may have different, and therefore potentially conflicting, values among their patients about these experiences; and c) people need specialized support in their local area when in crisis.

On November 3, an extratropical cyclone formed over the Central United States along a cold front, which moved into the Atlantic Ocean during the following day. On November 6, the system became nearly stationary between Bermuda and the Bahamas after separating from the front. The circulation became better-defined while convection increased. By November 8, the system had developed gale-force winds near the center, and at 0600 UTC that day, the NHC classified it as Subtropical Storm Sean. While convection and the wind field had become more symmetric, the system remained a subtropical storm due to the associated upper-level low. Within 12 hours, Sean separated from the low and transitioned into a tropical cyclone, after developing a warm core. It developed outflow and intensified due to light wind shear, combined with sufficiently warm water temperaturess of at least . With a ridge to the northeast, the storm moved slowly to the west. On November 9, an eye feature developed in association with Sean, which later morphed into a ring of convection. The NHC predicted Sean would intensify into a hurricane, although the storm reached peak winds of on November 10 as reported by the Hurricane Hunters. An approaching cold front subsequently induced higher wind shear on the cyclone as it tracked northeastward into cooler waters; this led to weakening. After passing roughly west-northwest of Bermuda, Sean transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 11. Early on the next day, it was absorbed by the cold front.

Klebanow and Jonas write that Brandeis had begun to evolve into "the people's lawyer." He was no longer accepting payment for "public interest" cases even when they required pleadings before judges, legislative committees, or administrative agencies. He also became involved in developing public opinion through writing magazine articles, making speeches, or helping form interest groups. He "insisted on serving without pay so that he would be free to address the wider issues involved rather than confine himself merely to the case at hand."

Red kidney beans are used to make Habichuela con Dulce. The beans need to be soft, so they are soaked in water overnight. After the beans are soft, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk need to be added to the mix of the beans. Before adding the milk, the mixture is dark, but after adding the milk, it lightens up while boiling. Sweet potatoes and sugar are added for the rich and creamy taste of the dessert. While adding the sugar and sweet potatoes, the mixture can be left thick, or thin so that the mixture flows better, but if it is left in the refrigerator, it will thicken as it cools. Habichuela con Dulce can have added spices for a sweeter taste. While the Habichuela con Dulce is mixing, spices such as ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and vanilla can be added depending on the family's recipe. After the mixture is done, raisins and butter are added to the mixture. Usually, the habichuela con dulce is left to cool down for a few hours before it is eaten. The dessert can also contain cookies, milk or a type of cassava bread.
