French political divisions made organising an operation against Ireland difficult. The process was further hampered by the French Atlantic Fleet's defeat in 1794 at the Glorious First of June and the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver operation in 1795. Having lost many of its best officers during the political purges of The Terror, these defeats bred a negative mentality in the French Navy, discouraging adventurous strategic thinking. Eventually, the "Expédition d'Irlande" was despatched in December 1796 under Admiral Morard de Galles, consisting of 17 ships of the line and 27 smaller vessels, and carrying as many as 25,000 men. Despite elements of the force spending up to a week in Bantry Bay, not a single French soldier was successfully landed, and the expedition was a total disaster, with 13 ships lost and over 2,000 men drowned.

Commercially the album was well received, opening at number five on the UK album charts, but faded away quickly. However, after the Mercury nomination the album saw a revival to gain gold status, with its second single "One Day Like This" re-entering the top 40 singles listing after the award win. The album had a steady chart run afterwards (including a re-entry in the top ten), enabling it to benefit from the busy Christmas market, and eventually reach over 300,000 sales, making it eligible for platinum status. It has since sold 860,000 as of September 2011.

Most of WCCM's programming is syndicated, including America's Radio News Network and Don Imus. Spanish-language programming is aired on weekends, with the exception of "Music and Memories" (an adult standards show) and "The Italian Show". WCCM is only licensed to operate from local sunrise until 30 minutes after local sunset (the latter with reduced power); this is to protect WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina. However, in the fall and winter months, it is not unusual for WCCM to be heard before sunrise. On election day, November 6, 2012, WCCM stayed on the air well past local sunset to broadcast election results in the Merrimack Valley areas of New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
During the time that Google owned SketchUp, users could select an option when they uploaded GeoLocated models to identify the model as being "Google Earth Ready". If a "Google Earth Ready" model was submitted, within a few weeks, the model would go through a review of several Google employees who checked the model's qualifications under certain acceptance criteria for inclusion in Google Earth's 3D Buildings layer. If the model passed, it was added to the "3D Warehouse Layer," and would soon be visible within Google Earth by checking the box in the sidebar labeled "3D Buildings." As of October 1, 2013, Google shut down the 3D Warehouse submission pipeline for Google Earth. According to the 3D Warehouse website, people can still create geo-referenced models in SketchUp and upload those models to 3D Warehouse, but Google no longer considers new submissions for acceptance into Google Earth's 3D Buildings layer.
