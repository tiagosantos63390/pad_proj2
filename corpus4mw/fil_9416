Mt. Carmel Methodist Church
The Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church is a historic church on Hempstead County Route 16, about south of the small town of Blevins, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a jerkin-headed roof, and a steeple topped by a hipped roof. It was built in 1942, using in part materials recycled from an 1870 church which was dismantled due to the establishment of the Southwestern Proving Ground in 1940. The church serves an African-American congregation that was, prior to its relocation, in a community that was originally named for, and supported by, Arkansas Senator James Kimbrough Jones. The church property includes a small wood-frame Sunday school building, constructed about the same time as the church, and a cemetery.
In 2006 he was elected state representative. On December 20, 2012, US Attorney Carmen Ortiz announced that Smith had agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of deprivation of rights under color of law for his role in a voter fraud scheme in which Smith cast absentee ballots for voters who were ineligible or unaware of ballots being cast in their names. It was announced that Smith would resign effective January 1, 2013. As part of his plea agreement, Smith will not be allowed to run for public office for five years.
It was built in 1925 and added to the National Register in 2002.

Second Stint with the Arizona Cardinals.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Ouerdane competed for the second time in the women's 70 kg class. She received a bye for the second preliminary round, before losing out by a waza-ari to Netherlands' Edith Bosch. Because her opponent advanced further into the semi-finals, Ouerdane offered another shot for the bronze medal by defeating Fiji's Sisilia Nasiga, with an ippon and a sankaku gatame (arm crush triangular arm lock), in the first repechage bout. Unfortunately, she finished only in ninth place, after losing out the second repechage bout to United States' Ronda Rousey, who successfully scored an ippon and a kuzure-kesa-gatame (broken scarf mat hold), in two minutes.
