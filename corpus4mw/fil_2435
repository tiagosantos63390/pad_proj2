The Culebra Island giant anole was first described in 1931 by American zoologist Chapman Grant, grandson of U.S. President Grant. It is named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who was the governor of Puerto Rico at that time. It was initially described as "Anolis roosevelti" but some have suggested it should be transferred into genus "Xiphosurus" in 2012. However, this new classification system is highly controversial because if creates polyphyletic groups in the genus Anolis. Therefore, the new classification system of Anolis has not been universally accepted.
