As a result, the Sixth United States Cavalry moved south to the present location of Fort Richardson.

The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.
There has been little development beyond lakeside cabins.
