The Henry IV style was the predominant architectural idiom in France under the patronage of Henry IV (1589–1610). The modernisation of Paris was a major concern of Henry's, and the Place des Vosges is the greatest monument to his architectural style and urban planning. Among Henry's other works are the Pont Neuf, the Place Dauphine, and some renovations at the Château de Fontainebleau. Though the second school of Fontainebleau was active in painting at the time, it is not generally considered part of the "Henry IV style".

Wissam was arrested along with 2 others but later on released without even a sentence after 7alesh's intervention. Since then, Al Jadeed straighten up and started again working according the agenda of 7alesh and constantly criticise anyone who opposes 7alesh. This is clearly shown in all their reports and especially in the introduction of their news.
