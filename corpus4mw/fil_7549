After completing his military service, Dannenberg returned to work for Sun Life, becoming the company chairman until his retirement in 1987.

The four are suddenly sent back to 3011 and find that history has been altered: Great Britain has won the Revolutionary War and taken over all of North America, turning it into "West Britannia". In this alternate timeline, David Farnsworth killed George Washington by smothering him with his wig and was rewarded with a dukedom, making Professor Farnsworth a noble landowner and consort of the Queen of England. Having depleted the world's crystalline opal supply, Farnsworth despairs that there is no way to travel to the past to fix their mistake until he notices an opal on the queen's crown. After stealing and crushing it, the four are able to use the preserved head of David Farnsworth to return to colonial times and restore the timeline. Once they return to 3011, everything is restored as it was before history was first altered, with one change: in place of the Gadsden flag hanging in the Head Museum is a similarly designed flag displaying Bender and a colonial spelling of his catchphrase, "Bite my shiny metal ass".

Too often individuals "pervert God's good gifts to their own detriment" or the second one wish is fulfilled they ask for another, without even remembering to say thanks to God for the first wish. The sermon text is there but Kierkegaard admits that sometimes he's "too cowardly, or too proud, or too lazy to want to understand the words properly." He also points out that people who are unable to live up to God's commands "prefer to be ashamed of themselves in their solitude." He says, "Have you been prompt in enduring the pain of the accounting; have you borne in mind that he loved you first? Have you been quick to judge for yourself that he should not continue to love you while you were slow to love in return?" His point is: "A person can truly love God only when he loves him according to his own imperfection".

The thin sidewall Geiger-Mueller tube enclosed within the brass probe body detects beta radiation and gamma radiation with the detecting probe's beta shield open, or gammas only when the shield is closed. The brass body of the probe has an energy-compensation effect on the readings taken from the probe, reducing the over-reporting of events from low-energy gamma radiation as can be encountered with non-compensated GM probes.
