Prior to The Fall, Herzer suffered from a degenerative disorder that was destroying his muscles and his ability to control them. As a result, he was fairly emaciated, slurred his words, and twitched. Herzer's parents were unable to deal with this emotionally and effectively abandoned him, granting him his "freedom" at age fourteen. Herzer's other friends and acquaintances drifted away at the same time. Shortly before The Fall, Dr. Daneh Ghorbani was able to cure him by using nanites to essentially rebuild his entire brain, one section at a time.

The 2005 re-release contains two rulesets and is therefore in a sense 'two games in one'. Besides the classic rules, there is also a new ruleset heavily inspired by another Eagle game, "Struggle of Empires" by Martin Wallace, and represents a more 'modern' type of boardgame. Players now fight for influence in key provinces and troops are not limited in their area movement anymore. New concepts include forced alliances, chaos points, action cards and senate votes.

As of the 2014 season, Scully calls approximately 100 games per season (all home games and road games in California and Arizona) for both flagship radio station KLAC and television outlet SportsNet LA. Scully is simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announces the remaining innings only for the TV audience. If Scully is calling the game, Charley Steiner takes over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Rick Monday as color commentator. If Scully is not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser call the entire game on television while Monday, now doing play-play, joins Nomar Garciaparra on radio.
