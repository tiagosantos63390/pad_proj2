Dolly Parton, a native of the Smoky Mountains town of Locust Ridge, Tennessee, gained national exposure on the nationally syndicated program "The Porter Wagoner Show". Her mountain-influenced, biographical brand of country and her down-home personality won many fans, and her star power would only begin to rise.
Overview.

She wrote over 400 poems, which were widely read during her lifetime both in Italy and abroad. Her works were translated into Spanish and she was popular at the Spanish court, which approved of her catholic beliefs. She was friends with the poet Torquato Tasso and with the painter and poet Bronzino, who also painted her portrait. With Laura Terracina, she exchanged poems in praise of the other.

Bibliography.
An edict of toleration was issued by the emperor Galerius from Serdica and posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence. Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313 when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties were to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners: The Christian communities of Mediolanum contributed its share of martyrs during the persecutions, but the first bishop of Milan who has a firm historical presence is Merocles, who was at the Council of Rome of 313.

Just as Montauk Highway was realigned along the north side of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road between East Patchogue and Brookhaven to divert through traffic away from Historic Bellport, Frowein Road was transformed into the Moriches Bypass, partially to divert truck traffic and through traffic away from historic sections of Moriches, Center Moriches, and East Moriches, New York, as well as the low railroad bridges in Moriches and East Moriches. Since the road runs along the north side of the LIRR tracks, it served as a more convenient route to Center Moriches Station until the Long Island Rail Road closed that station on March 16, 1998. East Moriches Station was also closer to Frowein Road, but that station was closed by the LIRR two years before Suffolk County upgraded the road.
