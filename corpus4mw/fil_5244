Raw natural gas out of a well is usually not a salable product but a mix of various hydro-carbonic gases with other gases, liquids and solid contaminants. This raw gas needs gas conditioning to get it ready for pipeline transport and processing in a gas processing plant to separate it into its components.Some of the common processing steps are CO2 removal, dehydration, LPG extraction, dew-pointing. Technologies used to achieve these steps are adsorption, absorption, membranes and low temperature systems achieved by refrigeration or expansion through a Joule Thomson Valve or a Turboexpander.

Sherard soon found himself maintaining a growing collection of rare plants at Eltham. Despite his ill health, he made several trips to continental Europe in search of seeds for his garden, which soon became recognized as one of the finest in England. In 1721, in order to help with a projected revision of Caspar Bauhinâ€™s "Pinax" of 1623, William Sherard brought the German botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius to England. In 1732, James published Dillenius' s illustrated catalog of the collection at Eltham. According to Blanche Henrey it was "the most important book to be published in England during the eighteenth century on the plants growing in a private garden" and a major work for the pre-Linnaean taxonomy of South African plants, notably the succulents of the Cape Province. Dillenius' herbarium specimens from Eltham are preserved in the herbarium of the Oxford Botanical Garden.
