The events CHICOS is designed to observe are single subatomic particles slamming into the Earth's atmosphere with the energy of a brick falling from a rooftop. These Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray, or UHECRs, interact with the atmosphere to produce large showers of secondary particles at the surface of the Earth. Detection of UHECRs therefore depends on an array of particle sensors deployed like a net over many square kilometers to catch the incoming shower. In the CHICOS project, schools across the Los Angeles area provide the "net" of detector sites with ready-made infrastructure and a valuable population of teachers and students who participate in the project.

In February 1997, age about 20, he was turned down for a job he applied for at a service station in Mangere. He returned to the station late at night and attacked an attendant with a stolen police baton. He severely injured the attendant resulting in her being close to death. William Bell was sentenced to five years nine months in prison and was placed amongst the hardest, most violent of criminals. He was released in July 2001 after serving three and a half years. However, he was not released on parole. Based on the law at the time, Bell was automatically released after serving two-thirds of his sentence. The board had no say in the matter - other than to set his release conditions. The Board imposed six conditions including alcohol and drug treatment and to work in a job approved by his probation officer.
