During the Lingayen Gulf campaign, "Richard P. Leary" on 6 January, during a suicide attack, she severely damaged an incoming “Irving” fighter, which managed to graze the forward 5-inch gun mounts before crashing—the only “damage” of the war. Later that day, she also shot down a “Jill” and rendered fire-support for the landings on the 9th. She again supplied gunfire support for the landings at Iwo Jima 19 February and for the landings at Okinawa 1 April. During the night of 6–7 April she escorted the damaged to Kerama Retto, Okinawa Gunto. Upon completion of duties at Okinawa her next assignment took her to Adak, Alaska, in August. After serving in the Aleutians, "Leary" sailed for Japan arriving at Ominato, 8 September. She departed Japan on the 30th, and steamed to San Diego, Calif.

The United States government was a construct of the thirteen states, and the Constitution's only original constraint on the states was, in Article IV, Section 4, that the federal government "guarantee to every state... a republican form of government." Though the Fourteenth Amendment contains the Equal Protection Clause and bars the states from "abridging" voting rights, the text does not address apportionment.
Note that by the standards of many types of experiments, a zero Z-factor would suggest a large effect size, rather than a borderline useless result as suggested above. For example, if σp=σn=1, then μp=6 and μn=0 gives a zero Z-factor. But for normally-distributed data with these parameters, the probability that the positive control value would be less than the negative control value is less than 1 in 105. Extreme conservatism is used in high throughput screening due to the large number of tests performed.

During the construction of the extension tunnel Oktyabrskoe Pole-Shchukinskaya a new engineering method was developed. Because the Moscow soil was sandy, the metro tunnels had traditionally been built using the open pit method (i.e. digging from the surface) or by restricting building work from passing under inhabited areas as cave-ins would have been very likely. For the Shchukinskaya tunnel however circular concrete blocks were pressed rather than mounted into the soil, and as this was done rapidly the elements did not have time to develop into heavy pressure and sap into the tunnel. This removed the need for festering a sand-cement mixture into the finish, thereby dramatically increasing the potential speed of construction, and saving on building materials. Another achievement was that no metal was used for the mounting of the tunnel blocks, instead a bitumen mixture formed from the pressure of the boring complex was used to join the blocks. As this was denser than the soil, there was no need for festering of the cement.
