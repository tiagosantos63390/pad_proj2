Upon his death in 1892, the pioneer’s wife and two daughters commissioned ths sculpture. The artist, Daniel Chester French, chose to use a frequented model of his, Jessica Penn Evans. The cast can be found in front of a crypt located inside the Forest Home cemetery. An interesting fact about T.A. Chapman is that he was a major player in restoring Milwaukee after a big fire down town. It is a building on N. Milwaukee and East Milwaukee. The building was built five stories high and contained beautiful murals painted by Vergillio Tojetti. He established T.A. Chapman Co. in 1857. The artist, Daniel Chester French, is more well known for his design of the "Lincoln Memorial".

Although it has shown small improvements over the years, Roger L. Putnam Vocational Technical Academy is currently designated as a Level 3 school by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. In 2010, no demographic achieved the goals set Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for English Language Arts, as measured by attendance, standardized test scores, and other factors. In mathematics, only white students made (AYP) (except "Meets or exceeds state requirements"), with all other demographics (save African American) posting a loss of progress. From 2003 onward, the years 2004 and 2008 were the most recent years in which the school met AYP.

Van Gogh painted "Water Mill at Gennep" (F125) in November, 1884. He wrote to his brother, Theo: "Yesterday I brought home that study of the water mill at Gennep, which I painted with pleasure, and which has procured me a new friend in Eindhoven Kerssemakers, who passionately wants to learn to paint, and to whom I paid a visit, after which we set to work at once."
The loch's drainage may have begun in the 18th century when Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton, was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates and other landowners followed his example. Intensive drainage work may have taken place in the 1740s as part of the improvements undertaken to provide employment for Irish estate workers during the Irish potato famines of the 1740s and the mid 19th centuries. Many drainage schemes also date to the end of WWI when many soldiers returned en masse to civilian life. The first OS maps do not show the loch site as having any open water, however the 1926 OS shows a small loch present.

In addition to his Olympic competition, Chris Stokes has been president of the Jamaica Bobsleigh Federation since 1995. He wrote "Cool Runnings and Beyond – The Story of the Jamaica Bobsleigh Team" (ISBN 1-58982-082-7) about his team's Olympic competition.

This characterization tool may also help in the kinetic studies on physical and chemical processes at a wide variety of surfaces giving chemical specificity via IR spectroscopy as well as high-resolution imaging via AFM. For example, the study of the hydrogen termination of Si (100) surface was performed by studying the absorbance of Si-O bond to characterize the reaction between silicon surface and atmospheric oxygen. Studies were also conducted where the reactivity of a polymer, a 1000-nm-thick poly-(tert-butylmethacrylate) (PTBMA) combined with a photochemically modified 500-nm-thick poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), with water vapor depicted the different absorption bands before and after water uptake by the polymer. Not only the increased swell of PMAA (280 nm) was observed but also the different absorption ability of water was shown by the different transmission of IR light at a much smaller dimension (<500 nm). These results are related to polymer, chemical and biological sensors, and tissue engineering and artificial organ studies. Because of their high spatial resolution, NSOM/AFM-Raman/IR techniques can be used for measuring the width of multilayer films, including layers which are too small (in the x and y directions) to be probed with conventional IR or Raman spectroscopy.

The basic principle involve two steps both performed optically. In the first step, the spectrum of a broadband optical pulse is converted by a spatial disperser into a rainbow that illuminates the target. Here the rainbow pulse consists of many subpulses of different colors (frequencies), indicating that the different frequency components (colors) of the rainbow pulse are incident onto different spatial coordinates on the object. Therefore, the spatial information (image) of the object is encoded into the spectrum of the resultant reflected or transmitted rainbow pulse. The image-encoded reflected or transmitted rainbow pulse returns to the same spatial disperser or enters another spatial disperser to combine the colors of the rainbow back into a single pulse. Here STEAM's shutter speed or exposure time corresponds to the temporal width of the rainbow pulse. In the second step, the spectrum is mapped into a serial temporal signal that is stretched in time using dispersive Fourier transform to slow it down such that it can be digitized in real-time. The time stretch happens inside a dispersive fiber that is pumped to create internal Raman amplification. Here the image is optically amplified by stimulated Raman scattering to overcome the thermal noise level of the detector. The amplified time stretched serial image stream is detected by a single-pixel photodetector and the image is reconstructed in the digital domain. Subsequent pulses capture repetitive frames hence the laser pulse repetition rate corresponds to the frame rate of STEAM. The second is known as the time stretch analog-to-digital converter, otherwise known as the Time Stretch Recording Scope (TiSER). The STEAM system can be designed with help of an online calculator.
From 1898-1902 Otto Sverdrup explored in the high Arctic. He discovered the islands of Axel Heiberg, Ellef Ringnes and Amund Ringnes, known as Sverdrup Islands, and claimed them for Norway. He was the first person known to have set foot on them. Norway retained territorial interests in the islands until 1930 when it formally recognized the sovereignty of Britain (Canada) over them.
Services to launch its first overseas programme with the opening of the Well Woman Centre in Dublin, Ireland. In 1978 a non-profit society, known as Parivar Seva Sanstha was opened in India under the management of Peter Lawton. These were soon followed by programmes in Sri Lanka and Kenya. Henrietta Search, who joined MSI in 1985, remembers how Tim and a small team strove to achieve more than their limited resources could really sustain.
Formerly known as Lambent Softsystems Private Limited (Company was re-christened to M/s EdServ Softsystems Limited on as late as April 22, 2008), EdServ was incorporated by Mr. S. Giridharan in 2001 with a view to provide training solutions, customized software solutions, staffing solutions and placement consulting to both Corporate as well as Institutional clients (IT, Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Retail sectors etc.). At that time, it was mainly focused on IT learning and placement solutions.
