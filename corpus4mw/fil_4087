The Parlows were in England when World War I broke out. During the war, Parlow toured neutral nations of Europe such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. She returned to North America for a tour in the spring of 1916. She returned to England, but the increasing difficulty of travel kept her there until 1919. Her former teacher emigrated to New York around this time because of the political situation in Russia, but Parlow worked with him less and less.

The gestation period for this species of hedgehog ranges from 30 to 40 days and the litter size can vary between 3 to 10 hoglets. This species often produces two litters in a season.
