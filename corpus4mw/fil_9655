Belloch is a member of Spain's Socialist Party. On 14 July 1993 he was appointed justice minister in a cabinet reshuffle and became part of the cabinet led by the prime minister Felipe Gonzalez. However, he was an independent member of the cabinet. He served in the post until 6 May 1996.
Monk's work was discovered in 1979 by Jac de Villiers, in a studio that he had recently moved into. Not only were they already perfectly constructed by the photographer, they were also impeccably annotated with dates and names, which made curation a simple and enjoyable process. The first exhibition of Monk's work took place at the Market Gallery in Johannesburg in 1982- and although Monk could not attend the event it was subject to much critical acclaim.
