The Yidiny language has a number of particles that change the meaning of an entire clause. These, unlike other forms in the language, such as nouns, verbs and gender markers, have no grammatical case and take no tense inflections.

Upon independence, there were 120 communes. A chain of demegers and partitions between 1849 and 1891 increased this number to 130. Most of these were brought about by asymmetrical population growth, as population growth in the south caused the balance of population in the country to shift; some of the communes born in that era include Rumelange, Schifflange, and Walferdange. In what is now termed 'Nordstad', Erpeldange and Schieren were separated from Ettelbruck.

Hollick-Kenyon Peninsula or Kenyon Peninsula () is an ice-covered spur from the main mountain mass of the Antarctic Peninsula, projecting over in a northeasterly arc from its base between Mobiloil Inlet and Casey Inlet. It was discovered and partially photographed from the air by Lincoln Ellsworth on his 1935 trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Sea. In 1940 it was photographed from the air and charted from the ground by the US Antarctic Service.
