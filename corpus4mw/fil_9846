Composition.
The church of the Sacred Heart was built in 1903. Designed by Walter Doolin, with the tower added in 1916 by O'Callaghan and Webb, the architectural design of this church is flamboyant. The church is a combination of rock-faced walls with fine sandstone dressings which provide an interesting textural detail. The artistic execution of the carved detailing, mosaics, stained-glass and the interior decoration complement richly enhance this imposing church.
