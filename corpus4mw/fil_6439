The origins of Chilean cinema can be traced back to the start of the twentieth century in the port city of Valparaíso, when the first film ever fully produced in Chile was launched at the Teatro ODEON on 26 May 1902. The film, "Ejercicio General del Cuerpo de Bomberos" (General Practice of the Fire Department), was only three minutes long and showed the annual public show performed by the Valparaíso Fire Department in the city's Aníbal Plaza. Nothing is known of the film's director, cinematographer or production team, and only 27 seconds of footage remain today, held by the Catholic University of Valparaíso.

An international mission in 2008, organized by the International Commission of Jurists and the Due Process of Law Foundation, admired the inclusive nature of the selection process, but received information from multiple sources about alleged irregularities in the elaboration of certain lists, and information concerning alleged political influence, which might serve to undermine the selection process. The Mission verified widespread distrust in the selection process, more specifically, a belief that the candidate lists are a result of political and powerful interest groups interferences.
