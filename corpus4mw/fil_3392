The third and final part of the story arc that started with "Lunarville 7", this episode was in fact filmed before the preceding instalment, "Crater 101". Initially underrunning the standard 25-minute length of a "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons" episode, "Dangerous Rendezvous" was padded out with a flashback sequence occurring during Colonel White's transmission, to recount how hostilities commence between Earth and Mars in "The Mysterons", and additional scenes in which White gives Dr Kurnitz demonstrations of Spectrum communications devices and a display Angel launch. The Mysterons also threaten to destroy Cloudbase in "Attack on Cloudbase", although the method of assault is more direct with the use of armed spacecraft.
