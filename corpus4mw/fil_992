Kwik Save is a discount supermarket chain, originally Welsh, with stores across the United Kingdom. It went into administration in 2007, but was brought back in April 2012. Its stores were small to medium sized high street supermarkets, mainly located in areas with below average incomes. It struggled to make profits in the 21st century as superstore operators such as Tesco and Sainsbury's introduced their own budget brands, and other discounters such as Lidl and Aldi (who both arrived in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 1990s) expanded. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but it went into administration on 6 July 2007 and closed most of its stores across the United Kingdom, with the remaining 56 being sold to a new company, FreshXpress, which itself went into administration in March 2008. It was then resurrected in a smaller form with nine stores, but this second incarnation of FreshXpress went into administration and ceased trading in 2009. All remaining stores have since been closed.

Pitchfork Media and Allmusic journalist Mark Richardson defined it thus: "The vanishing-point music created by drone elders Phill Niblock and, especially, LaMonte Young is what happens when a fixation on held tones reaches a tipping point. Timbre is reduced to either a single clear instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level interaction between small clusters of "pure" tone becomes the music's content. This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish "music" from "sound," discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again from scratch."
