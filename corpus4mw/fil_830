A strong rivalry exists between Saint Ignatius and St. Edward High School. The two schools are quite similar in that both are Catholic, all-boys schools on the west side of the Cleveland area. The schools are separated by only six miles. One of the main reasons for the rivalry is that the schools draw from the same student pool of boys from west side Catholic grade schools. Because of this, when the students face off in direct competition, they commonly are up against former grade school friends.

The county was of great importance to the Normans; Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy. Because of this the county was divided into five new baronies, called rapes, each with at least one town and a castle. This enabled the ruling group of Normans to control the manorial revenues and thus the greater part of the county's wealth.

With three races left to run, the teams headed to Italy in mid September. Monza, ever a Ferrari heartland, saw them lose pole to Patrese, although they were second and third. Piquet jumped both Ferraris to run second behind his teammate in the opening laps, but it did not last long, as electric problems claimed Patrese on lap 3, reliability proving the undoing of Brabham once again. Piquet was then unchallenged for the rest of the race, and came home to record his first victory since the opening race in Brazil, some six months before. Arnoux took second with Cheever third and Tambay fourth. Elio de Angelis scored his first points of the year with fifth, with Derek Warwick surprisingly scoring points for the second time in a row in sixth. The strong performances of Piquet and Arnoux, coupled with Prost's failure to score, left the championship in a very interesting position with two races left. Prost still led with 51, Arnoux had 49, Piquet 46 and Tambay 40 with 18 points left on the board. Ferrari maintained their lead in front of their home fans, now with 17 points back to Renault.
