Nemčić's literary opus is described as one of the few that transcended the pragmatic and revivalist function of the Illyrian movement. His first poems were published in "Danica ilirska" (1839), and until his death he had made a sizeable poetic opus, mostly covering romantic love motifs. These were posthumously assembled in the book "Pjesme" ("Poems", 1851). His "Putositnice" (1845) is a canonical work of Croatian romanticism. It is a travelogue modeled on Laurence Sterne's "Sentimental Journey". The rest of Nemčić's opus is fragmentary and incomplete: the second part of "Putositnice" ("Neven", 1852), five fragments of "Udes ljudski" ("Neven", 1854 ) – one of the first attempts at the modern novel in Croatian literature, written also in antimimetic tradition of Laurence Sterne – and a drama "Kvas bez kruha ili Tko će biti veliki sudac?" ("Neven", 1854), a successful farcical comedy which ironizes Croatian political life and electoral machinations. He has written a number of feuilletons and newspaper articles, and a critical biography "Život Tome Blažeka" (in the book "Političke pjesme Tome Blažeka", 1848). Nemčić served as the model for the character of Antun Gostinski, the narrator of the novel "Ispovijest" by Blaž Lorković ("Dragoljub", 1868).

The 41-second first-look motion poster the film drew comparisons with the popular minute-long advertisement campaign run by a Turkish newspaper, "Sabah", to announce their distribution of the "New York Times" as a supplement. The original advertisement features iconic images of the cities of New York and Istanbul, designed using news articles and headlines from the newspaper to show the two cities in the form of newspaper clippings. The motion poster of the film showed prominent places in Chennai and the entire city itself in the form of newspaper clippings and headlines, just like the advertisement campaign, without an acknowledgement to the makers of the original.
