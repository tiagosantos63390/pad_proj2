Nebraska was placed in the North Division with the four other Midwest schools in the conference, plus Colorado, all of which were in the conference prior to 1996; the Oklahoma schools joined with the former SWC members (all of which were in Texas) to form the South Division.

The ranger station includes four wood frame buildings dating to the 1930s as well as a variety of more recent structures. The first Baker Ranger Station was built in 1911, amounting to four rooms and regarded as unsightly. It was removed by the time new structures were built, beginning with a 1935 cottage, followed by an office, barn and garage-fire cache structure. The cottage was based on U.S. Forest Service Plan R-4, No. 23, the office on R-4, No. 4, and the barn R-4, No. 13B. The buildings were built by men on the local relief rolls. Other infrastructure items at the compound were built by Civilian Conservation Corps labor.
