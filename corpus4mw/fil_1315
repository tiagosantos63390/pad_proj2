Reiko's family name is Mouryou, which in the Japanese language refers to an assortment of spirits and demons. Although they have very different personalities, those in the Mouryou family each share an unapologetic and casual sadism and even cannibalism. It seems they'd kill a man and devour his heart as matter-of-factly as anyone else would unwrap a candy bar.

The MSL applies only to the SIM, so once the contract has expired, the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone, however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Provider's MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers' SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the U.S. are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers that are close to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independent phone vendors.

The notion that Limasawa is Mazaua was first suggested by ex-Augustinian priest, Carlo Amoretti, who had not read what Combés had written about Limasawa. As shown by what he wrote as quoted above, Combés was ignorant of the Mazaua story. He thought the anchorage of Magellan's fleet was Butuan, rather than Mazaua, the real port.

A "biker's tan" is a tan line that goes up 3/4 of the leg, where lycra bike shorts would normally begin to cover. Depending on the activity, the inner side of the arms may be paler than the outer side. Unless the biker uses cycling gloves made to allow tanning, the area on the back of each hand will usually not be tanned.
In an experiment on two groups of rock hyraxes fed hardened or softened versions of the same foods, the animals fed softer food had significantly narrower and shorter faces and thinner and shorter mandibles than animals fed hard food. Experiments have shown similar results in other animals, including primates, supporting the theory that masticatory stress during childhood affects jaw development. Only one small study has investigated this effect in humans. Children chewed a hard resinous gum for two hours a day and showed increased facial growth.
