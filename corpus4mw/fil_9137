Hacker launched PassportMD in 2005, and served as CEO until 2009. The personal health record (PHR) service collects and keeps a secure, HIPAA-compliant online database of the medical histories of adult patients, and is accessible by the patient and the patient’s designated physicians. The idea for the service came to Hacker after his father had a medical emergency while on a European cruise. Hacker felt that a service that organizes one’s medical records would help expedite the necessary transfer of information during such an emergency. When it began, the data was stored on CD-ROMs and given to patients, but it is now entirely online.
