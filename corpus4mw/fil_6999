After the horrors of the French Revolution, Villers moved to Germany and there in Göttingen in 1794 befriended the German intellectual Dorothea von Schlözer and her husband, the Mayor Mattheus Rodde. The Rodde-Schlözer home was a centre for intellectuals across Europe. Dorothea was a pioneering female intellectual, the first woman to gain a doctors degree in Germany. Villers moved in with the Rodde-Schlözers in 1797 and they lived semi publicly as a menage a trois the rest of their lives. Villers' French nationality was able to preserve the household from the worst ravages of the French occupation in 1806. He reported these catastrophic events in his "Lettre à Mme la Comtesse de Beauharnais, Fanny, contenant un récit des événements qui se sont passés à Lübeck dans le journées du jeudi 6 novembre 1806 et les suivantes."
