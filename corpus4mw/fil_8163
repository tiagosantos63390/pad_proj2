Twain described the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first since her separation from Lange. She had to "find as a songwriter again" and become independent once again. "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. For Twain, the music was simple to write, only occupying approximately two lines of sheet music. Then, the lyrics began to flow as "Why Not? with Shania Twain" progressed.

She believed it ultimately became "the natural theme song of the series". She explained the song's relevance to the television series: "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way."
