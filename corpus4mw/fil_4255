Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
While working on the downtown and Old South Baton Rouge community plans, Plan Baton Rouge turned its attention toward parish issues by applying for the opportunity to receive an in-kind audit of East Baton Rouge Parishâ€™s comprehensive plan and related ordinances. In 2004, the Smart Growth Leadership Institute and University of Southern California, funded by a grant from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), selected Baton Rouge as one of nine cities in the nation to receive this service. The audit examined the Parish comprehensive plan, the Horizon Plan, to assess if this vision document promotes Smart Growth principles. The audit further assessed whether the legal ordinances contained in the Unified Development Code enable the parish to accomplish its Horizon Plan vision. With the recommendations of the audit, Baton Rouge is underway with revisions to the current codes to include new standards for development and new tools for encouraging Smart Growth.
