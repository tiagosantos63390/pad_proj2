Hill fully supported the "line" of the Chinese Communists until Mao Zedong's death in 1976, but after the 1972 change in Chinese policy away from world revolution and towards an alliance with the United States, the CPA(ML) lost many of its adherents, particularly among radical students.

In later years Larkin was plagued by a downward spiral of drug abuse, alcoholism and homelessness. By this time estranged from his parents, he had developed a routine of spending his nights at the Old Brewery Mission, and his days panhandling at Schwartz's, eating at Monod Frites, drinking beer at the Copacabana bar, or reading a book in the lounge at Welch's used book store. Towards the end of his life, he found himself back in the limelight when a 14-minute computer-animated documentary on his life, "Ryan" by Canadian animator Chris Landreth, won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and screened to acclaim at film festivals throughout the world. "Alter Egos" (2004), directed by Laurence Green, is a documentary about the making of "Ryan" that includes interviews with both Larkin and Chris Landreth as well as with various people who knew Larkin at the peak of his own success.

Ciborra claims that much of the IS and IT world (particularly their strategic management, marketing, academia and training organisations) are in crisis. He teaches that this is because IS and IT are treated as scientific disciplines when in fact they are social disciplines and hence thinking about them is based in an inappropriate paradigm which we might call "Positivism" (although Ciborra does not use this term).
