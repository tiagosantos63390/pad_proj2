Five school districts were formed in November 1761. Each district had its own committee, which was appointed regularly and consisted of three persons. The districts were called Nichol's Farm, Daniel's Farm, Long Hill, White Plain and Cutler's Farm, for the area they served. The number was increased slightly in 1762 when Long Hill was split into Upper Long Hill and Lower Long Hill. Tashua School was first noted in 1769.
