Some of Dickinson-Brown’s usually short poems are written in experimental (mostly French-style syllabic) meters, but most are classical in both form and subject. They are often written in the plain style and were evidently influenced by the epigrammatic tradition of Catullus, Martial (whom he translates) and J. V. Cunningham, including their social satire and sometimes "risqué" humor. The most frequent themes are loneliness, age, love, death, physics and religion. The French poems are all epigrams.
