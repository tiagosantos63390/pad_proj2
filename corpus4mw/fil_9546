Conley and Chris Clarke took leaves of absence from work to live in Indianapolis during the subsequent 2012–13 season. Clarke was selected to the Atlantic 10 Preseason All-Conference second team, but Butler started the season unranked. During the opening round game of the Maui Invitational, Clarke hit a running 3-pointer at the buzzer to lead Butler to a 72–71 victory over Marquette. Video of the shot went viral. "You grow up as a kid — I know I did — watching that tournament, wanting to be in that situation in that atmosphere", Clarke remarked. "To hit a shot like that and be able to celebrate with my teammates was one of the coolest things ever." For his efforts, Clarke was named to the All-Tournament team and selected as the Atlantic 10 Player of the Week.
