As seen above, the Möbius group PSL(2,C) acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where "Q"=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of hyperbolic 3-space "H 3", we see that the Möbius group acts on "H 3" as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the Möbius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.
The earliest usage of "tianlong" 天龍 "heavenly dragon", according to the "Hanyu Da Cidian", is in the "Xinxu" 新序 "New Prefaces" by Liu Xiang (79-8 BCE). It records a story (Yuan 2006:213) about a man named Ye Zigao 葉子高 who professed to love dragons. After he carved and painted dragon images throughout his house, a [天龍] heavenly dragon "fulong" 夫龍 in some editions came to visit, but Ye was scared and ran away. 
Les Baxter's album "Ritual of the Savage" ("Le Sacre du Sauvage") was released in 1952 and would become a cornerstone of exotica. This album featured lush orchestral arrangements along with tribal rhythms and offered such classics as "Quiet Village", "Jungle River Boat", "Love Dance", and "Stone God." "Ritual" is the seminal Exotica record, influencing all that came after it. As the 1950s progressed, Baxter carved out a niche in this area, producing a number of titles in this style including "Tamboo!" (1956), "Caribbean Moonlight" (1956), "Ports of Pleasure" (1957), and "The Sacred Idol" (1960). Baxter claimed Ravel and Stravinsky as influences on his work.
The mineral distribution in rodent enamel is different from that of monkeys, dogs, pigs, and humans. In horse teeth, the enamel and dentin layers are intertwined with each other, which increases the strength and wear resistance of those teeth.

Neurotoxin production is the unifying feature of the species "C. botulinum". Eight types of toxins have been identified and allocated a letter (A-H). Most strains produce one type of neurotoxin, but strains producing multiple toxins have been described. "C. botulinum" producing B and F toxin types have been isolated from human botulism cases in New Mexico and California. The toxin type has been designated Bf as the type B toxin was found in excess of the type F. Similarly, strains producing Ab and Af toxins have been reported.
Filipović re-entered the Pride ring, competing in Pride 2006 Open-Weight Grand Prix on May 5, 2006. It was during this tournament that he came up with the quote, "Right leg, hospital; left leg, cemetery". His first match at the "Pride Total Elimination Absolute" event was against Ikuhisa Minowa, the lighter but highly acclaimed professional wrestler and mixed martial artist. Filipović won by TKO 1:10 into the fight. On July 1, 2006 at "Pride Critical Countdown Absolute", Filipović defeated 1992 Olympic judo gold medalist Hidehiko Yoshida by technical knockout (leg kicks) in the first round to move on to the semi-finals.

Galileo's conjecture was merely that — a conjecture. So was Kepler's cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, Newton showed that Kepler's three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.
At the end of the Twenties, the North Tower again proved to be the weak point of the architecture, and had to be supported by guy wires in winter 1932/33; the preservation of the castle was supported by the "Club for the preservation of the Wewelsburg" ("Verein zur Erhaltung der Wewelsburg"). After 1925, the renovation activities decreased.

History.
Nickel silver was first known and used in China. During the Qing Dynasty, it was "smuggled into various parts of the East Indies", despite a government ban on the export of nickel silver. It became known in the west from imported wares called "bai-tong" or "paktong" (白銅, literally "white copper"), for which the silvery metal colour was used to imitate sterling silver. According to Berthold Laufer, it was identical with "khar sini", one of the seven metals recognized by Jābir ibn Hayyān.

Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. His father was Harold George "Baron" Oliphant, a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and part-time lecturer in Economics with the Workers' Educational Association. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. She was called by her second name, Edith. He was named after Marcus Clarke, the Australian author, and Laurence Oliphant, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. He had four younger brothers, Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald. His parents were theosophists, and as such opposed to eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy, after witnessing the killing of pigs on a farm. He was also found to be completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe astigmatism and short-sightedness.

Arising shortly after the end of World War II, a particular set of stylistic tendencies in the United States during this time is known as Googie (or "populuxe"), derived from futuristic visions inspired by the imagery of the Atomic Age and Space Age, with motifs such as atomic orbital patterns and "flying saucers", respectively, such as in the Space Needle in Seattle. Though the style was unique to the United States, similar iconography can be seen in the Atomium in Brussels.

Among the better-known bands from the early 1990s are Fifth Column, God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, PME, Sister George, Team Dresch, Tribe 8, and Mukilteo Fairies. As these bands gained popularity and awareness of the movement grew, zines began appearing from around the world; "The Burning Times" from Australia, and "P.M.S." from the UK are examples.

The second feature was the 1965 American production "Incubus", a low-budget black-and-white horror film directed by the creator of the television series "The Outer Limits" and starring William Shatner. Though the film is admired for its stark artistry, Esperantists generally cringe at the actors' poor pronunciation.

A 1995 survey concluded that 76% of people riding on local METRO bus lines took the buses because they had no other means of transportation. A 1993 survey concluded that of the people who had stopped riding local bus routes of METRO, 46% had acquired or repaired automobiles. 37% of the respondents said that METRO could not possibly do anything to convince them to ride the buses again. As of 1997 11 percent of METRO drivers were Hispanic. Around that time many residents who lacked a strong command of English feared taking METRO routes, believing that the METRO drivers would not be likely to understand them.

The seminal work in the field is "The Extended Mind" by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998). In this paper, Clark and Chalmers present the idea of "active externalism" (similar to semantic or "content" externalism), in which objects within the environment function as a part of the mind. They argue that it is arbitrary to say that the mind is contained only within the boundaries of the skull. The separation between the mind, the body, and the environment is seen as an unprincipled distinction. Because external objects play a significant role in aiding cognitive processes, the mind and the environment act as a "coupled system". This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own. In this manner, the mind is extended into the external world. The main criterion that Clark and Chalmers list for classifying the use of external objects during cognitive tasks as a part of an extended cognitive system is that the external objects must function with the same purpose as the internal processes.
