By far the biggest hit from the score of "The Harvey Girls" was "On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe". MGM released the song to record companies even before shooting was finished on the film, and it became an instant hit dominating the airwaves through the summer and fall of 1945, with versions by Bing Crosby with Six Hits and a Miss, Judy Garland and The Merry Macs, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with the Sentimentalists, and, the most popular, Johnny Mercer and The Pied Pipers. Mercer's version entered the "Billboard" charts on July 5, 1945, and stayed on it for 16 weeks, including seven straight weeks as #1 between July 28 and September 8. Crosby's entered the charts on July 19 and stayed ten weeks, going as high as #4, while Dorsey's entered on August 2 and stayed for six weeks, peaking at #6. Garland's hit the "Billboard" #10 position on September 20. The song was also number 1 on "Your Hit Parade" for eight weeks running.
Early life.
Gillespie, Kidd & Coia was revived in 1945, although without Kennedy, who later emigrated to Canada. Coia hired 17 year old Isi Metzstein as an apprentice and continued to design churches and other works for the Roman Catholic Church. The firm's work of this period is considered by architectural historians to be inferior. Rodger describes Coia's difficulty with seeing projects through, which was countered by his "flair for heading an architectural office". This led to the development of an atelier-style practice, with Coia gradually handing over design control to concentrate on client relations. In 1954 Andy MacMillan, a contemporary of Metzstein at the GSA, joined the firm from the East Kilbride Development Corporation, and despite neither of the young architects being fully qualified, they had assumed creative control by 1956. Coia's last significant architectural work was for St Charles, North Kelvinside in 1959.

The textbook became an item of national news coverage in April, 2008. A New Jersey high school senior expressed concerns to a think tank, the Center for Inquiry, regarding what he felt was conservative bias in the textbook, specifically inaccuracies about its coverage of global warming. The senior also wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times. The group issued a critical report on the textbook. The group's criticism of the coverage on climate was buttressed by a few scientists, and then additional criticism from legal scholars who claimed the book presented a skewed view of separation of church and state. The publisher Houghton Mifflin announced that it would review the book, as did the College Board which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.

Such fears proved unfounded, as Noda qualified within a second of Comas' time, and was the 25th fastest. But when David Brabham's best time in the Simtek was disallowed, Noda was bumped up to 24th on the grid, alongside Comas in 23rd. But in another department, he had comprehensively thrashed his more experienced team-mate. Under braking, he was pulling 4.1g, a Larrousse record, whereas Comas often pulled less than 3g. It showed how quickly he had got the hang of powerful Formula One brakes.

Nonetheless, some of their ideas were put into practice when, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as regent during Louis XV's minority, created a form of government known as polysynody, where each ministry was replaced by a council composed of aristocrats. However, the absenteeism, ineptitude and conflicts of the aristocrats caused this system of governance to fail, and it was soon abandoned in 1718 in favour of a return to absolute monarchy.

In most Unix-like systems, all processes of a pipeline are started at the same time, with their streams appropriately connected, and managed by the scheduler together with all other processes running on the machine. An important aspect of this, setting Unix pipes apart from other pipe implementations, is the concept of buffering: for example a sending program may produce 5000 bytes per second, and a receiving program may only be able to accept 100 bytes per second, but no data is lost. Instead, the output of the sending program is held in a queue. When the receiving program is ready to read data, the operating system sends its data from the queue, then removes that data from the queue. If the queue buffer fills up, the sending program is suspended (blocked) until the receiving program has had a chance to read some data and make room in the buffer. In Linux, the size of the buffer is 65536 bytes. An open source third-party filter called bfr is available to provide larger buffers if required.
