Career.
Shoaib returned for two more wickets, and when Paul Collingwood chipped a return catch to Danish Kaneria England were 130/8 with 20 overs still to bat. They had little option but to put on their Super Sub Vikram Solanki, a specialist batsman, for bowler James Anderson - Solanki joined in with Liam Plunkett, who hit a maiden fifty in his second ODI for England, as the two shared a 100-run partnership. However, Plunkett and Steve Harmison were out in successive balls in the penultimate over, and England set a target of 230 on a pitch that had been described as "flat and perfect for batting". As it turned out, it wasn't enough - Flintoff, Harmison and Collingwood got a wicket each, but the Pakistani batsmen hit 34 boundaries in total - 138 of 231 runs - with Akmal sharing two 70+ stands, the opening with Salman Butt, and a third-wicket one with Mohammad Yousuf (who hit 28 off 68 balls) to carry Pakistan to 187/3 before he pulled a Harmison short ball to Solanki for 102. By that time, though, Pakistan needed 44 in 13.3 overs, and Inzamam-ul-Haq hit six fours in an unbeaten 31 as Pakistan made it to the target with six overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)
