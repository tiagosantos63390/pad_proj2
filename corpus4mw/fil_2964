District history.
The main shipping route between the ports of Stockholm in Sweden and Turku in Finland passes through the Åland Islands. It enters the Ledsund strait from south-west with Föglö on the south-east side and Lemland on the north-west. An anchorage () of the shore of Flisö in Föglö is protected from the prevailing south-westerly winds by two small islands. This anchorage was previously called "Granhamn", Swedish for 'Spruce harbor'. On modern maps it is marked as "Rödskärs flädan" after the larger of the two protecting islands. The smaller island is now called "Granhamns holmen" or Granhamn's island. It should not be confused with the island also named "Granhamn" in the Stockholm archipelago.
