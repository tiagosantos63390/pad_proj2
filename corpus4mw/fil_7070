Montgomery played in the session with a group called The Mastersounds which included two brothers of his, Buddy and Monk Montgomery. Dick Bock,a producer for Pacific Jazz Records, was familiar with Montgomery and invited him to record. "Fingerpickin'" was a song contributed by Montgomery and is his only original composition on the album. The recordings were not particularly successful despite the talents of Montgomery and a young Freddie Hubbard, however, they enhanced his reputation especially amongst jazz guitarists. They are the first recordings of a musician who would later be hailed as one of only three real innovators in jazz guitar, as quoted by Joe Pass.
