In "Ghost Story" Molly has struck out on her own, as one of the two persons being called the Rag Lady (the other being The Leanansidhe), having magical and mundane beings kill each other using illusion magic and stuffing strips of cloth (from the tattered remains of Harry's Fae Armor in "Changes") into their mouths as her calling card. Murphy and other characters such as Will Borden and Butters fear that her grip on sanity has become tenuous after Harry's death and have begun to treat her as a threat. When Harry visits Murphy and her team, Molly is called in to verify by using her Sight that it's really Harry and not an impostor. It is also revealed that the Leanansidhe has been teaching Molly magic, stating that his oath to Mab and his death meant that she, as Harry's godmother, must honor the position. Unlike Harry, she uses pain to speed Molly's training along. Further, Molly is still in love with Harry and tells him that though his returned affections would have indeed been wrong when she was younger, she is now in her mid-twenties and capable of making her decisions. At the climax of the novel, during a mental battle between the Corpsetaker and Molly, the inside of her mind is shown as the treehouse whose interior is the bridge of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), with multiple Mollys playing every member of the crew (from "Kirk" on down to a Redshirt). It also turns out that Molly and Harry arranged for Harry to be killed by Kincaid, so that he could escape his oath to become the Winter Knight, which he feared would eventually turn him into a monster. At the end of the novel, Molly believes that Harry is dead and gone for good.
