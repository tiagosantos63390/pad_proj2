"Ignomínia" is a short but powerful poem that has a tragic and profound tone. It speaks of the atrocities committed against the innocent people of Rwanda while the rest of the world remained silent and took no action to protect them. It severely criticizes the governments of the industrialized nations for allowing the genocide to take place in Rwanda. The poem ends with this disturbing verse: "Ruanda ainda conta os crânios dos seus filhos" (Rwanda still counts the skulls of her children).

It is the least given rating, in essence scoring the film an 11/10 or a "better than perfect." When a Spill reviewer gives this rating, a sound clip of a cheering audience plays. Examples: "The Dark Knight", "Cloverfield", "Up", "Toy Story 3" "District 9", "The Artist", "The Cabin in the Woods", and "Rush (2013 film)".

In July 1975, the Reform Party merged with the Progressive Party, which eventually became the Progressive Federal Party in 1977. This proved to realign opposition politics in South Africa, with the demise of the United Party as the PFP became the main opposition party, following the 1977 general election.
