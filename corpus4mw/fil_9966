Coalbed methane received a major push from the US federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.

Randall Louis Young (born July 4, 1954 in Montgomery, Alabama) is a former National Football League offensive lineman who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976. He attended Carol City High School and then Iowa State University before being drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the 12th round, 338th overall, in the 1976 NFL Draft.

Temerario joined the Washington Redskins as an assistant coach in 1960, overseeing the ends and the defense at different stages through 1965. He became the Redskins' head of pro player personnel in 1966 and served in that position for 13 years until his retirement in 1978. In 1975, he considered bringing in professional wrestler André the Giant for a tryout in training camp. Temerario called and then canceled a press conference with the 7-foot-four-inch wrestler, which led to speculation that he had been signed. Temerario, however, said he had only pondered the possibility and that André the Giant's salary requirements made the move impossible. He was then making about $200,000 a year ($ in dollars). The Redskins never had a winning season while Temerario was an assistant coach, although the team advanced to the playoffs five times during his career as an executive. The team reached Super Bowl VII in 1972, but lost to the Miami Dolphins.
The San Quintín field is the only known location of intraplate-type mafic alkalic volcanism on the Baja California peninsula. The oldest cones mainly erupted primitive magmas with occasional small xenoliths. As the field evolved, differentiated magma became more common, although extremely pure primitive magmas – virtually devoid of xenoliths and unusually rich in olivine phenocrysts – still dominated at the young cones. These primitive magmas originated from progressive partial melting of spinel lherzolite at unusually shallow levels in the mantle. The ultramafic xenoliths found are mostly spinel lherzolite, with the final 20% harzburgites, dunites, and pyroxenites. The San Quintín field is also the only source of peridotitic and granulitic xenoliths on the peninsula. The largest and most abundant xenoliths are found in differentiated magmas.
Niven was born at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, one of five notable mathematician brothers. He graduated first from the University of Aberdeen, then from Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a Wrangler and was elected a Fellow of his college. He spent most of his teaching career as Director of Studies at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, succeeding Thomas Archer Hirst in that position in 1882. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (Civil division) in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Honours of 1897. He retired in 1903, when he was knighted by being appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
Mounds are observed to be generally more nutrient poor and fewer plants establish on them in comparison to pits for several reasons. Mounds tend to erode and thus are more unstable than the forest floor or the pit. The surface of the mound also contains very little organic matter because it is mainly soil that was uprooted from the mineral horizons of the soil layer. This coupled with the observation that seed deposition rates are lower for mounds than pits, makes plant establishment on mounds unlikely and problematic for the plant.
