On December 1, 2006, Waiz campaigned to abolish the City Court to save taxpayers money. This was brought up because City Judge Vicki Carmichael was elected to the Clark County Superior Court bench and was set to take office on January 1, 2007. Rather than continue the court system, Waiz wanted to abolish the court like many other cities have done previously in Indiana in an effort to reduce costs. His campaign didn't succeed. Also during 2006 Waiz helped negotiate a $5 million offer to help aid the Jeffersonville Town Center commercial center development by Vision Land Development, which has been in the works since 2002. The $5 million became $7 million in January 2007 with additional funds from the city's TIF district. This is was major issue in Waiz's reelection campaign. Galligan criticized the Waiz administration for failing to move the project forward while Galligan promised to develop the project. No stores have opened in the Town Center as of 2010.
