As Medieval Kabbalists never tire of stressing the unity and non-plurality in the concept of the Sephirot, so Luria stressed the metaphorical nature of the Partzufim. They are Divine "faces", manifestations of the Godhead, alternative aspects through which God manifests Himself, and do not imply any plurality in God.

where a, b and c are determined by the offset angle and focal length and the zone index. This feature introduces some new problems to the analysis of offset Fresnel zoneplate antennas. The formulae and algorithms for predicting the radiation pattern of an offset Fresnel lens antenna are presented in , where some experimental results are also reported. Although a simple Fresnel lens antenna has low efficiency, it serves as a very attractive indoor candidate when a large window or an electrically transparent wall is available. In the application of direct broadcasting services (DBS), for example, an offset Fresnel lens can be produced by simply painting a zonal pattern on a window glass or a blind with conducting material. The satellite signal passing through the transparent zones is then collected by using an indoor feed.
After her first movie in 1998, she was already being recognised by people. But when she did Authority (1999), the movie became very popular and it really shot her into limelight. After Authority, she has been moving from one movie set to the another by the grace of God.

The San Marino national football team's first official association football match took place on 14 November 1990 against Switzerland. Previously unofficial matches had taken place against a Canadian Olympic team in 1986, and a series of matches at the 1987 Mediterranean Games against Lebanon, Turkey and Syria. These matches took place prior to the nation's affiliation with FIFA. San Marino has not yet qualified for the finals of a major international football tournament, however they do hold the record for the fastest goal ever scored in FIFA World Cup qualification, with Davide Gualtieri scoring San Marino's only goal in their 1–7 loss against England in 9 seconds on 17 November 1993. Andy Selva remains the only player to have scored more than two goals for San Marino.
