England began day five looking as though they were looking to drag the day out for a draw, but Jones and Border had other ideas. Resuming their free-scoring from the previous evening, the pair moved rapidly onwards, Jones scoring at better than a run-a-ball for a well made 40 not out off 34 balls. Although not quite as rapid, Border's 60 not out off 76 was still quite pacey, and the captain clearly had a plan in mind when he soon declared the Australian innings closed at 230 for 3, leaving England an unlikely 401 for victory off two sessions.

Scholars have wondered what it was that Sycorax did to avoid execution, as described in Act one, Scene two by Prospero: "for one thing she did / They Algerians would not take her life." Charles Lamb, a Romantic writer fascinated by Shakespeare and his works, suggested she might have defended her nation, as did the banished Algerian witch. In the early nineteenth century, it was believed that this woman escaped execution because she defended her people from the invasion of Charles V. Later scholars, however, have argued that Sycorax was saved from execution because she was pregnant. This was not uncommon, as many female criminals in Shakespeare's day got pregnant in order to avoid execution.
