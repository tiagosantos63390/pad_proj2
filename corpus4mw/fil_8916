The Keśin Hymn has a long history of evolving interpretation, including misleading or superficial translations of the word "Keśin" and of the meaning of the Keśin Hymn. Yāska (c. 500 BCE) interpreted Keśin to mean the sun or the sun God "Surya". Sāyana (c. 14th century ACE) supported that view, followed by some early European Sanskrit scholars, including H. H. Wilson and M. Bloomfield. Hermann Oldenberg took the view that the Keśin Hymn described the "orgiastic practices of the old Vedic times" and the "drunken rapture" of the Keśin, which eventually evolved into the Buddhist goal of liberation.

A microculture depends on the smallest units of organisation – dyads, groups, or local communities – as opposed to the broader subcultures of race or class, and the wider national/global culture, compared to which they tend also to be more short-lived, as well as voluntarily chosen. The study of kinesics – the nonverbal behavior of the small gathering – can be used to illuminate the dynamics of a given microculture.
