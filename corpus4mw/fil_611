During medieval times, the Ilidža area was part of the Bosnian province of "Vrhbosna". "Katera", one of the two original Bosnian towns mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in De Administrando Imperio, was found on the ground of today's Ilidža municipality. The disciples of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius considered the area important enough to stop by Vrelo Bosne and build a church in the area.
