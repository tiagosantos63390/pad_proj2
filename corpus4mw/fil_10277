Maryland Route 100 was the designation for the portion of Old Frederick Road from MD 99 at St. Johns Lane near Ellicott City east to the Howard–Baltimore county line at the Patapsco River. Much of the highway was constructed as a macadam road from the river west to approximately the modern intersection of US 29 and MD 99 in 1923. The gap from there to MD 99 was filled with a concrete road between 1930 and 1933. In 1956, the portion of MD 100 from MD 99 at St. Johns Lane to Rogers Avenue was replaced with an extension of MD 99 east along Old Frederick Road and south along Rogers Avenue; the portion of MD 100 east of Rogers Avenue was transferred to county maintenance.

Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, allows the applied statistical geneticist to convert one's data from several input formats to a large number output formats suitable for analysis by commonly used software packages. In a typical human genetics study, the analyst often needs to use a variety of different software programs to analyze the data, and these programs usually require that the data be formatted to their precise input specifications. Conversion of one's data into these multiple different formats can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Mega2, by providing validated conversion pipelines, can accelerate the analyses while reducing errors.
