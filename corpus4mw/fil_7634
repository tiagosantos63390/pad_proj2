In the late 1990s, research in Hunter Valley vineyards discovered that a wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included "Colletotrichum acutatum" (ripe rot), "Greeneria uvicola" (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of "Aspergillus, Penicillium" and "Alternaria". Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent "Botrytis" grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320 nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.

In the 18th century Nevyansk (Ural mountains)was a small Old Believers' center. There were just a few workshops there, the experience of icon painting had been only 100 years. Life wasn't so easy for icon painters: regular roundups, searches. The masters hid in skits. They didn't paint to sell, only when they had orders (if there wasn't any, they didn't paint at all). People respected icon painters, all of them were literate. Their customers were literate too, they were sophisticated and very rich Old Believers. They knew what they wanted to get for their money. Besides all of them were sincere believers and they were ready to do everything for their faith. That's why appeared the phenomenon " Nevyansk icon". There isn't a great quantity of Nevyansk icons, but each of them is a precious treasure. Sometimes the museum takes icons which cannot be restored, only for the last fragments.
