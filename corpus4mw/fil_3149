Johnny Orchard, a young boy, is jealous because his neighbors have bear pelts hanging on their barns, so he takes a rifle and goes hunting for the biggest bear in the valley. However, when he finds only a bear cub, he befriends it by feeding it maple sugar and brings the bear home as a pet. As it grows, it becomes a nuisance to his family and the neighbors due to its enormous appetite. After the neighbors complain to his father, Johnny tries three times to return the bear to the woods. Each time the bear follows Johnny back home. Finally Johnny and his father decide the only way to solve the problem is to shoot the bear. Johnny takes the bear far into the woods, but while loading his rifle, the bear runs off and into a live trap that has maple sugar in it. Men who had set the trap to capture animals for the zoo soon come. They take Johnny's bear to a zoo where Johnny can visit him anytime.

SR 49 was first designated along its current route between US 30 in Van Wert County and the Michigan state line in 1927 having replaced a discontinuous section of SR 51. In 1932, the route was slightly extended south to Convoy south of US 30 before absorbing SR 51 south to Greenville the next year. All of SR 51 was then renumbered to SR 49 in 1935 extending the route from downtown Dayton to Michigan. No major changes would occur to the routing until around 1960 when a part of SR 49 was rerouted on a new expressway segment of US 40 south and west of Clayton (now partly I-70) and the route through southern Darke County was straightened to bypass Arcanum. The old routing through Arcanum became SR 49 Alternate.
