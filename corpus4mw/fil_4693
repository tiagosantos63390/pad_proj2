Entering the 2008 season, the Crimson Tide was ranked No. 24 in the AP Poll and was not ranked in the Coaches' Preseason Poll. After their upset victory over Clemson in week one, Alabama moved into the No. 13 position in the AP and No. 17 in the Coaches' Poll. The Crimson Tide continued to move up in both polls each week through week seven when they reached the No. 2 position in both polls after their victory at Georgia. The Crimson Tide remained in the No. 2 position over the next four weeks until No. 1 Texas was upset by Texas Tech in week nine. In the polls released after the Texas loss, the Crimson Tide moved into the No. 1 position in both polls. Alabama remained in the No. 1 position until their loss in the SEC Championship Game to Florida when they dropped into the No. 4 position prior to their bowl game appearance. They then ended the season with a final ranking of No. 6 in both polls after their loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl.
