Kooyonga first appeared on a racecourse in August when she won a maiden race at Gowran Park by three lengths. Four weeks later she was moved up to Listed class and won the Silver Flash Stakes at Phoenix Park by a head from the odds-on favourite African Dance. In October, she returned to Phoenix Park for the Cartier Million, a valuable sales race, in which she finished second to Rinka Das. On her final start she successfully moved to Group Three class to record a four length win in the Leopardstown Stakes.
