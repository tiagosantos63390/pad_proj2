Manuel Esperón González (August 3, 1911 – February 13, 2011) was a Mexican song writer and composer. He wrote many songs for Mexican films, including "Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!" for the 1941 film of the same name, "Cocula" for "El peñón de las ánimas (The Rock of Souls)" (1943), and "Amor con Amor Se Paga" for "Hay un niño en su futuro" (1952). Other Esperón compositions have become Latin standards such as "Yo Soy Mexicano", "Noche Plateada" and "No Volveré" which was used in the first episode of the 2001 soap opera "El juego de la vida". Among other performers, Chavela Vargas, Pedro Infante, Los Panchos, and Jorge Negrete have made his songs well-known. His fame in the USA derives from when his song "The Three Caballeros" was used in the Disney film "The Three Caballeros" (1944).

The "gwb43.com" domain name was publicized by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), who sent a letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee committee chairman Henry A. Waxman requesting an investigation. Waxman sent a formal warning to the RNC, advising them to retain copies of all emails sent by White House employees. According to Waxman, "in some instances, White House officials were using nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications." The Republican National Committee claims to have erased the emails, supposedly making them unavailable for Congressional investigators.
