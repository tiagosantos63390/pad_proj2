Normal red blood cells are round, flattened disks that are thinner in the middle than at the edges. A "poikilocyte" is an abnormally shaped cell. Generally, poikilocytosis can refer to an increase in abnormal red blood cells of any shape where they make up 10% or more of the total population.
The princess parrot is a medium sized parrot, 34 to 46 cms long and weights between 110 and 120Â grams. The plumage is mostly green with a pink throat, bluish crown, and bright green shoulders. The rump is blue and the tail is long and narrow. The males have longer tail feathers and brighter coloring than females. The male also has a coral-red beak, while the female's is duller and has a greyish crown. Another difference is that the male has an orange iris, while the female's is much browner. In addition, the male of the species has a longer, projecting extension from the end of the 3rd primary (flight) feather on each side. This projection is called a 'spatula' or 'spatule". It appears in mature male birds.
KKSS signed on with the format in 1985, although at times they had detoured to mainstream Top 40 a few times, mostly when they got new competition (most of them short-lived). But that all changed when Univision bought the station in 2002 from Simmons Media Group and flipped it back to its current Rhythmic Top 40 direction after its former owners tried to make it a mainstream Top 40 again.
