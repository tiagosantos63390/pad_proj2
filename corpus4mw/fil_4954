While amateur wrestling continued as a legitimate sport, grappling as a promotional business did not catch on until the late 1920s when the success of the more worked aspects of professional wrestling in America, like gimmickry and submission holds, were introduced to British wrestling. Amateur wrestler, Sir Atholl Oakley got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined "All-in" wrestling. Under the British Wrestling Association banner, Oakley's promotion took off with the likes of Tommy Mann, Black Butcher Johnson, Jack Pye, Norman the Butcher, College Boy, and Jack Sherry on the roster while Oakley himself would win a series of matches to be crowned the first British Heavyweight Champion. The business was reaching one of its highest points at the time, with the best part of forty regular venues in London alone. The great demand for wrestling, however, meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more violent styles, with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became common place. In the late 1930s, the London County Council banned professional wrestling, leaving the business in rough shape just before World War II.

"Time Out New York" reported on November 19, 2013 that the graffiti on the exterior of the 5 Pointz building was painted white overnight, providing images that showed the building's previously graffiti-covered walls partially covered in white paint. A message posted to the 5 Pointz Twitter account the morning of November 19 confirmed the reports. Despite a lawsuit filed by 5 Pointz proprietors as well as a rally on November 16, 2013, to gain petition signatures to protect the building from demolition, the sudden whitewashing indicates the end of the space.
