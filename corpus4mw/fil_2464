In the past several years, the Chorus has expanded its achievements with successful tours to New England, the Midwest, the Southeastern United States, California and Canada. In addition to these extended trips, the Chorus also travels to other universities for competitions and festivals. In the past, the women have performed at Harvard for the Centennial Celebration of the Radcliffe Choral Society as well as joint concerts with the Toronto Women's Chorus, the Penn State Glee Club, and the Wellesley Chorus. And finally, perhaps the greatest recent accomplishment of the Chorus has been to begin touring internationally, with a trip to Taiwan in 1998, a joint tour with the Glee Club to Venezuela in the summer of 2001, and a tour to Italy in 2005. The Chorus and Glee Club are planning a joint tour to China for the spring of 2008.

St. Helen’s School was founded by Miss May Rowland Brown in 1899. Having been trained as a teacher at Cambridge Training College for Women, she began to teach at Northwood College, a school which, at the time, refused to take in any students that were connected with trade. Whilst still at Northwood College, a group of local businessmen persuaded her to start another school, and so she did. At the age of 25, in January 1899, she founded Northwood High School, later named St. Helen’s School. In 1999, St. Helen's School celebrated their first centenary.
Two of the founding members also play in Frantic Mantis.
