"Drosophila hibisci" use mating plugs rather than traumatic insemination. The mating plugs of "Drosophila hibisci" are gelatinous, hard composites that adheres to the uterus of the female in the event of copulation. A study tested two hypotheses concerning mating plugs: a) that they were nutritional gifts for females to digest to provide maintenance of the eggs during maturation, or b) that they could serve as a chastity device to prevent sperm of rivals. The study found that mating plugs had no effect on female nutrition and serve as an enforcement device against rival males. Although this species of fruit flies ("Drosophila hibisci") found success in mating plugs, they are ineffective for other "Drosophila" species. A study found that males who insert their mating plugs within females were unable to prevent females from remating just four hours after mating. Therefore, the assumption can be made that male "Drosophila melanogaster" develop other male adaptations to compensate for mating plug insufficiency, including intra-genitalic traumatic insemination to directly deposit their sperm.

The Völsung Cycle is a series of legends in Norse mythology that were first recorded in medieval Iceland, but which were also known (as carving show) in Sweden, Norway, England and (perhaps) the Isle of Man. The original Icelandic tales were greatly expanded with native Scandinavian folklore, including that of Helgi Hundingsbane, which, in turn, originally appears to have been a separate tradition the Ylfings.

The Federation naval fleet was composed of various types of ships of varied design, however the most commonly encountered by Blake and his team were dark-red bullet-shaped craft called Pursuit Ships. Travis had taken command of the latest version, the Starburst-class, which were the only ships with a top speed capable of keeping up with the "Liberator". In later seasons, Tarrant identified the attacking pursuit ships as "the new mark fours" which appeared identical to the Starburst-class, yet apparently more advanced and maneuverable. Individually, the ships were no match for the "Liberator" which often destroyed them with a single shot from her neutron guns. However the attacking ships usually ganged up on her with plasma bolt volleys which could easily cripple "Liberator" once her power reserves ran down. This often forced Blake, and later Tarrant, to come up a clever tactic to save the ship when retreat was not an option.
