The defending champions Three Star Club did not participate. All matches were held at the Pokhara Rangasala. Due to a sponsorship deal with Him-Shree Foods (a Pokhara-based food company), the tournament is officially known as the 12th Aaha! Rara Gold Cup 2014. Which is named after its flagship product, "RARA" instant noodles. 

In support of the album, the band plans to perform at various shows and festivals through the end of 2014 before a full-scale tour happens in 2015.

From his defeat at Scirthaea, Tryphon, along with the remnants of his army, shut himself behind the gates of Triocala and prepared to resist the inevitable siege. Lucullus, however, was slow to follow up his victory at Scirthaea and it was not until nine days after the battle that he finally arrived outside the walls of the rebel stronghold and placed it under siege. Several times Lucullus attempted to take the city by assault, however all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Romans and seemed to merely embolden the defenders. Lucullus therefore settled for a long siege to starve the enemy out.
