Oxalis adenophylla, commonly known as Chilean Oxalis or Silver Shamrock (among other common names), is an Argentinian and Chilean alpine plant. It does well in far-north locations such as Sweden, Norway and Nova Scotia (Canada), as well as in purely temperate regions. Its cold-hardiness comes from the bulb's adaptation to freezing during dormancy. It is, however, susceptible to rot in the winter in temperate zones, a problem not present where ground freezes in winter. It is tolerant of some shade, but will bloom most with southern full sunlight[http://www.paghat.com/chileanoxalis.html].
Biography.
The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba. A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former routing was given the M‑121 designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934. Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in 1934, and the former route was initially designated M‑54.
