His union bankrupt, Russell kept a lower profile during the 1910s. He and the union returned to the arbitration court in 1925 to seek further wage increases, but their case was rejected. In 1926 an attempt to reduce work hours was also unsuccessful, and unemployment in the industry forced Russell to call for increased tariffs on machinery. The financial situation did not improve during the Depression, during which Russell's salary was £1 per week, and he resigned in February 1933. He and his son Roy, who had worked as an honorary assistant, claimed £500 in back payments; Roy addressed the union in 1936 claiming his father was destitute and threatening to go to the press and the union agreed to pay the debt in £1 instalments. Russell died in 1943 at Footscray.
