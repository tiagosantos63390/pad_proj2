In an interview with "Entertainment Weekly", Murphy commented on the structure of the series' first season. "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, can go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." When asked if the House "pulled" the Harmons to it, Murphy responded: "I don’t know if they were targeted. I don’t think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it… although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there’s always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh."
