In May 2004, the UHS name gave way to Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. The name reflected a change in mission as the University added a second college, the College of Biosciences. The College of Biosciences accepted its first students in the fall of 2005, offering a one-year master of science in biomedical sciences degree. The College of Biosciences has since added a two-year master of science in biomedical sciences and a master of arts in bioethics, which will enroll its first students in Fall 2008.
