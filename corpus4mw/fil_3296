Unlike the Hindu ritual, in Meher Baba's Dhuni the cleft in the ground (in Baba's case a "Dhuni-urn") does not symbolize the female vulva and no special importance is given to any of the physical objects, but rather emphasis is given to the consumptive symbolism of the fire itself. This is arguably more in keeping with Meher Baba's Zoroastrian lineage in which fire is considered a sacred symbol. Also, like the Dhuni observed by Sai Baba of Shirdi, whom Meher Baba contacted in his youth, Meher Baba's Dhuni is not sectarian, but religiously universal and accessible to those of all religions and sects and also to those with no formal religious affiliations at all. Meher Baba's Dhuni is also unique among fire rituals in that it is performed on the 12th of each month as per Meher Baba's instructions.
