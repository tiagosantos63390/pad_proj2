"Scyllarus pygmaeus" was first described in 1888 by Charles Spence Bate as part of the results of the "Challenger" expedition. He based his description of ""Arctus pygmaeus"" on material from "off Gomera" in the Canary Islands. In the same publication, he also described ""Arctus immaturus"" from the Cape Verde archipelago, which Eugène Louis Bouvier realised in 1915 was simply the "nisto" (juvenile) stage of "S. pygmaeus". Applying the principle of first reviser, Bouvier established that "S. pygmaeus" would be the valid name, over "S. immaturus". Although "S. pygmaeus" is not rare in the Mediterranean Sea, its presence there was overlooked for decades, due to the confusion between it and the more conspicuous "S. arctus", whose immature form "S. pygmaeus" was often assumed to be. In 1960, Jacques Forest and Lipke Holthuis demonstrated for the first time that "S. pygmaeus" does indeed occur in the Mediterranean Sea, from museum specimens at the "" in Naples.

Jewish Talmudic Calendar is coupled with the Rabbinical Chronology, taking Monday, (Julian) Oct 7, 3761 BC. as the date of creation, and the beginning of the Era of the World (Anno Mundi).

By extension, "gol" ("home") also means "family". In the latter sense, the "gol" is the smallest unit of Shilluk society. An unmarried man does not have his own home; unmarried individuals are attached to their father's "gol". If his father has died, the single person joins the "gol" of his oldest living married brother. The owner of the house is the head of his family, responsible for its inhabitants and the family herd. Since the traditional remedy for an offense is payment in cattle, the head of the family (not the wrongdoer) is responsible for the offense.
The Albanais from then on joined the history of Savoy: in 1630 as well as from 1690 to 1697, the Savoyard States were invaded by the troops of Louis XIV of France and in 1792, the lands of Savoy were freed for the first time from the House of Savoy and was occupied by French Revolutionary forces up until 1814. After briefly being part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, a referendum ratifying the Treaty of Turin validated the annexation of Savoy to France in 1860, after which Savoy was split into the two departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie.

The 18th Infantry Regiment, formerly the 8th Volunteers, was organized at Camp Wyatt, near Carolina Beach, North Carolina, in July, 1861. Its members were from Wilmington and the counties of Robeson, New Hanover, Bladen, Columbus, and Richmond.

The earliest form of the given name "Angus", and its cognates, occurs in Adomnán's "Vita Columbae" (English: ""Life of Columba"") as "Oinogusius", "Oinogussius". This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as "Onnust", "Hungus". According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, "Oengus", was borrowed from the British Pictish "Onuist", which appears in British as "Ungust". Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic "*Oinogustos". Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: "*Oino-gustos", meaning "one-choice". Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected "*Oinogustos" thus: "*Oin<del>o</del>gust<del>os</del>".
