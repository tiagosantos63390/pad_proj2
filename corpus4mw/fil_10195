Marlfield House, County Wexford is an Irish country house built in 1852 and was one of the two houses owned by the Earls of Courtown. It was a dower house on the Courtown estate and is a good example of a rural regency style house. Owning two residences was not uncommon for wealthy families during the 19th century and the Stopfords (the family name of the Earls of Courtown) were no exception. Guests regularly came to stay at both Marlfield and Courtown House, the principal family home, located some three miles from Marlfield. The Stopford family was ultimately unable to support their lavish lifestyle and Courtown House no longer exists today. Marlfield House was further improved in 1866 by James Thomas Stopford (1794-1858), fourth Earl of Courtown. The house has historic connections with James Walter Milles Stopford (1853-1933), sixth Earl of Courtown, Major James Richard Neville Stopford OBE (1877-1857), seventh Earl of Courtown, and James Montagu Burgoyne Stopford (1908-1975), eighth Earl of Courtown. It is now a hotel.

Jacob L. "Jake" Barnett (born May 26, 1998) is an American physics student and child prodigy. According to a memoir penned by his mother, he was diagnosed with autism when he was 2 years old and was taught privately by his parents. He showed an interest in physics from a young age, and coauthored and published a physics research paper at the age of 13. In a review of Mrs. Barnett's memoir in "Skeptic", educator Chris Edwards described Jacob as an autistic savant, but added that there was no solid evidence that he was "anything more than a typical autistic savant." Psychology professor Dr. Joanne Ruthsatz, who studies child prodigies at Ohio State University, in an interview on "60 Minutes" estimated that talents like Barnett's occur in about one in ten million individuals.

'Given his experience as a (Shakespearean) actor, (Fred) ends up...working as an entertainer for the troops. And playing all the female parts. He’s not entirely happy... “Look at me, dressed like a bird,” he grumbles. “They used to come from miles away to see my Titus Andronicus.” ' (Alastair Wallis: "Movies About Girls")
