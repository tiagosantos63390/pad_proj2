In contrast, Protestant Nonconformism in its various forms has fewer adherents than are found in the east of the county, and many Methodist, Baptist and other chapels have been closed. The sale of several chapels in Chichester city enabled Methodists and United Reformed Church adherents to join forces and open a small red-brick church together in 1982; and Baptist worship in the city has a continuous history going back more than 300 years, now maintained in a postwar building in the suburbs.
