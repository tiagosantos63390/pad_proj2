McGrigor became First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff on 20 December 1951 and, having attended the funeral of King George VI in February 1952, he was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Elizabeth II in 1 April 1952. He also attended the coronation of The Queen in June 1953. As First Sea Lord he was a leading proponent of carrier-based air power and revived the title of Fleet Air Arm (which had been renamed "Naval Aviation" in 1946).

In 2010-12 total investment in water and sanitation averaged about R$ 8 billion (USD 3.4 billion) per year. The National Sanitation Plan (Plansab) approved in December 2013 foresees investments of around R$ 15 billion (USD 6.8 billion) per year. As of 2005 investments by service providers participating in the national water and sanitation information system SNIS stood at only 3.55 billion Brazilian Reals, including 1.53bn for water and 1.35bn for sanitation and 0.67bn for other investments. It has been estimated that investments in water and sanitation infrastructure in the order of R$ 9.6 billion (US$ 4.5bn or $24 per capita or 0.7% of GDP) per year, or almost three times the level of 2005, would be needed to achieve universal access. The Program for the Acceleration of Economic Growth raised investment levels since then.
