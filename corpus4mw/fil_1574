Fuller's longest-lasting friendship has been with James Drury, whom he met (along with Robert Horton, 9 years Fuller's senior), when the three were under contract at MGM, beginning in 1954; they have been friends for six decades. It was Drury who put Fuller in touch with Jock Mahoney, who in turn contacted Dick Jones. When their contracts were up, both Drury and Fuller switched to Universal, where they each starred in their own Western series. In 1959, Fuller co-starred opposite his old friend, John Smith, in "Laramie" (before joining the cast of "Wagon Train", after "Laramie"'s cancelation), while Drury starred in "The Virginian" for 9 seasons; Fuller appeared in the same series, later in its run, in two episodes in which Drury didn't appear.

Although the Bank was originally a private institution, by the end of the 18th century it was increasingly being regarded as a public authority with civic responsibility toward the upkeep of a healthy financial system. The currency crisis of 1797, caused by panicked depositors withdrawing from the Bank led to the government suspending convertibility of notes into specie payment. The bank was soon accused by the bullionists of causing the exchange rate to fall from over issuing banknotes, a charge which the Bank denied. Nevertheless, it was clear that the Bank was being treated as an organ of the state.
The history of modern water supply in Singapore began with the construction of the MacRitchie Reservoir, which was built by the British in 1868. The Lower Peirce Reservoir and the Upper Seletar Reservoir were completed in 1910 and 1940 respectively, in order to supply the rapidly modernising colonial city with sufficient water. In 1927 the municipal commissioners of Singapore and Sultan Ibrahim of the state and territories of Johor in neighboring Malaya signed an agreement that allowed Singapore to rent land in Johor and use its water for free. In 1932 a pipeline to transport the raw water to Singapore was inaugurated. Another pipeline was built to return a smaller quantity of treated water to Johor. During the Battle of Singapore in 1942 the Causeway that links Singapore with Malaya and that carries the pipeline was blown up by retreating British troops, thus unintentionally destroying the pipeline, which left Singapore with water reserves that could last at most two weeks. According to Lee Kuan Yew, this was one of his motives to envision water self-sufficiency for Singapore later when he became the city-state's Prime Minister.
