Literary critic John Kenneth Muir felt the script had many plot-holes left many unanswered questions, and that there was "little effort to forge a coherent story out of the mix". "New York Daily News" writer David Bianculli described "Laserblast" as "numbingly bad". In "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies", Phil Hardy describes it as "a wholly unimaginative film", adding, "Even the non-stop series of exploding cars becomes monotonous in the hands of director Rae." The "Time Out" Film Guide described "Laserblast" as a rip-off of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", and said Billy's reign of destruction seemed random and senseless rather than driven by plot or characterization. The review called the film "the epitome of what Frank Zappa once hymned as 'cheapness. "The Globe and Mail" writer Robert Martin called the script inept, said Steve Neill's make-up effects were "frightful rather than frightening", and said Cheryl Smith could "barely talk, let alone act". Martin also stated the film was pulled from a Toronto theater after showing for one week.

In August 2003, SMHS proudly opened its doors for its 50th anniversary year. SMHS is the first archdiocesan high school in Indianapolis to reach this historic milestone. In October 2003, many of the Franciscan Sisters who first staffed the school, along with other former teachers, administrators, and alumni were invited to a very special all-school Mass. Nearly 80 of Father Thomas Scecina’s surviving relatives attended that Mass and held a family reunion on the SMHS campus. Throughout its first 50 years, SMHS has continued its tradition “to give that little extra”. With great gratitude and reverence for its past, SMHS looks forward to another 50 years of changing lives in its crucial ministry of educating spirit, mind, and body.

After graduating in 1970, Ray briefly enrolled in a nursing program at Marquette University.

Georg Misch wrote one of the first extended critical appropriations of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, which evaluated phenomenology from the perspective of Dilthey's philosophy, in "Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl", Leipzig 1930 (3. Aufl. Stuttgart 1964). He is mostly known for his monumental "Geschichte der Autobiographie" ("History of Autobiography"), in several volumes, beginning in 1907, the last one being published posthumous in 1969. He is the pupil and son-in-law of Wilhelm Dilthey, some of whose works he edited, and attempted to further develop his life-philosophical hermeneutics.

"Honjung" (, ) is a Korean practice during which scholars reflect on the day and pay gratitude to their parents. "Honjung" is half an hour long in the evening ritualized in assembly dormitory rooms. Students direct their thanks to 'dorm parents', or dormitory supervisors, in proxy of their parents. Once the dorm parent finishes his or her moral discourse and announcement, all the students bow to the dormitory inspector. The afterward time is used to make announcements and share celebratory events, like birthdays.
