After many years of teaching these methods, Sue Lloyd met Christopher Jolly (managing director of Jolly Learning Ltd.) at a conference in 1989. After a few years of research and trials, Chris encouraged Lloyd and Wernham to compile "The Phonics Handbook", which was published in 1992. Since then, the range of products has been developed, and Jolly Phonics has now been used in over 100 countries, with some countries such as Trinidad, The Gambia and the Seychelles adopting it as government policy.
In music theory, the counter parallel is terminology used in German theory derived mainly from Hugo Riemann to refer to (US:) relative (German: parallel) diatonic functions and is abbreviated Tcp in major and tCp in minor (Tkp respectively tKp in Riemann's diction). The chord can be seen as the "tonic parallel reversed" and is in a major key the same chord as the dominant parallel (Dp) and in a minor key equal to the subdominant parallel (sP); yet, it has another function. According to Riemann the chord is derived through "Leittonwechselklänge" (German: "leading-tone contrast chords").
