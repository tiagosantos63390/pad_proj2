In February 2010 the Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy, said in the House of Commons that faith was "at the very foundations of the Labour Party" and encouraged openness to religion in public life. O'Brien responded by saying he "welcomed the sentiment" but pointed out that "a tangible example by the Government over the last decade that it acknowledged or endorsed religious values would also have been welcomed. Instead we have witnessed this Government undertake a systematic and unrelenting attack on family values." O'Brien said to the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Iain Gray, "I hope he Benedict XVI gives you hell his September 2010 visit for what has happened over the past 10 years."

The next day, Natalie runs a lab test to test from the liquor holder that Bo found from Todd's hotel room after Todd claimed that he was poisoned by his twin brother Victor Jr. (who returned to town after he was presumed dead after being shot by Todd, but was really kidnapped and had his death faked by Allison). At first, Natalie found no proof of any poisonous substance, but she later called Bo to tell him that she checked the tests again, and found arsenic in the liquor holder, confirming Todd's suspicions that Victor Jr. poisoned him after all. Later, Natalie finds a mysterious tattoo that was found from a dead body outside in the river, Tea recognizes that Victor Jr. has the same tattoo on his arm. After a DNA test on the dead body, Natalie came to Tea's house saying that the DNA found on the dead body matched Victor Jr., meaning that he killed the person found outside in the river. Natalie also strikes up a friendship Destiny Evans at Shelter.

He also held U.S. patent number 1,507,111 (September 2, 1924) for “a new and useful Lens System for Galilean Telescopes.” In previous lens systems for Galilean telescopes, “the elimination of the image defects was generally confined to the removal of the chromatic longitudinal aberration and the chromatic difference in magnification as well as to the elimination of the astigmatism for a certain definite locus of the eye.” But “a faultless image outside the axis can only be attained by simultaneously eliminating for the whole telescope the spherical longitudinal aberration and the condition of sine.” These requirements were fulfilled by the invention in question, in which the astigmatic difference no longer depended “so largely from the locus of the eye, as such has been the case in the Galilean telescopes hitherto known.” This was achieved by “making the objective consist of two collective members, each of which is composed of two cemented lenses, of which the one having the lower refractive index is facing the incident light, and by composing the ocular of three cemented lenses, the inner one being a flint lens.”
Rules of evidence represents just one example of the different practice that applies to international arbitration, and which distinguishes it from provincial forms of arbitration rooted in the procedures of a particular legal system. There are a variety of approaches to international arbitration at the national level, even where model laws have been adopted. These approaches can be further impacted by arbitral rules that may be agreed between the parties. Similarly, international arbitral practice has given rise to its own non-country-specific standards of ethical conduct which are believed to apply in international proceedings and, more to the point, to the arbitrators who are appointed to conduct them.
