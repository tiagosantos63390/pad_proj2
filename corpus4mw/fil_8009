In the 2012 NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors selected Green in the second round, 35th overall. Prior to the season, Green signed a three-year, $2.6 million contract with Golden State. In the season opener on October 31 against the Phoenix Suns, Green played one minute, made one defensive rebound, and committed one foul. Green would gradually get more playing time in subsequent games, especially in the wake of injuries to Brandon Rush and Richard Jefferson. Green had both his first career steal and assist on November 7. In the November 9 game, a 101-77 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, Green played 13 minutes and scored his first career point on a free throw. He missed both of his field goal attempts and had two rebounds, a steal, and a turnover. Playing for 10 minutes on November 14, Green scored 5 points on 2-of-3 shooting and 1-of-2 free throw attempts. Green also grabbed a rebound and made his first career blocked shot.
Justice Black turned to specific issues with the majority. He had not found its explanation of how the district court had erred in applying "Stanley" to the importation of images for private use. As a general matter, he wrote, "he mere act of importation for private use can hardly be more offensive to others than is private perusal in one's home. The right to read and view any literature and pictures at home is hollow indeed if it does not include a right to carry that material privately in one's luggage when entering the country." Nor did he find the majority's specific reason, that travelers returning from abroad and their luggage are routinely subject to search, compelling since it was just as likely that police would search a private home for reasons unrelated to suspected possession of obscene material.
His last opinion ("Parra v. Traeger" (1931) 214 Cal. 535) was filed on December 31, 1931. He died on June 25, 1932.
