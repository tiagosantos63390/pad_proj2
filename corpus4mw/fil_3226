The single's title, "Wham Bam", was shown as "Wham Bam Shang-A-Lang", and made #16 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the summer of 1976.

Arista head Clive Davis himself co-produced their sole album.
In 1958, Thomas finished tied with Peter Thomson after 72 holes in the Open at Royal Lytham, but lost the 36-hole Saturday playoff by four strokes. At Muirfield in 1966, he again finished as runner-up, one stroke behind Jack Nicklaus. Throughout his career, Thomas was renowned for his long, straight, driving, and once hit a drive during a practice round for the 1967 Open at Hoylake onto the green at the second hole.
