During normal transcription, RNA polymerase transcribes a number of short nonproductive oligonucleotides, and this process is called abortive transcription. In this patented technology, the trapped RNAPs have been named abscriptases and the synthesis of specific length oligonucleotides called abscription. Artificial promoters, or abortive promoter cassettes (APCs) are used to make a different abscript of specific length and sequence which can be separated and quantified. Abscription efficiently produces trinucleotides at approximately 1,000 to 10,000 abscripts per minute.
