His father (Thengai Srinivasan)does not want his son to be a saint so he asks a press reporter (Radhika Sarathkumar) to change him back to normal. She sets up a number of things such as an interview, which he thwarts. Later, on the pretense of taking him to a temple, she plans another set up. On the way to the temple, she pretends that the car has broken down and he leaves to roam around a bit. While he is walking he sees a crying child and offers him a chocolate. Suddenly he is swarmed by children and the adults of the village think he is a children kidnapper. During this commotion, Radika cut's Arun's beard off-a symbol of piety.

Albert de Rippe ("Alberto da Ripa") (c. 1500–1551) was an Italian lutenist and composer. He was born in Mantua and worked there before 1528, when he left for France. There, he joined the court of Francis I. De Rippe was evidently held in great esteem at the court, as his annual salary was double that of any other lutenist, and he also frequently received gifts of land, money, wine, etc., and various other benefits. He only published three works during his lifetime, but six volumes of his music were published posthumously by his pupil, Guillaume de Morlaye. That edition was titled, and is now sometimes referred to as, "tablature de leut".
