The Panis were an important tribe of Afghanistan lasting to the time of Sikandar Lodi. Ahmed Abdulla writes that "the most important Pakhtun tribes of the Division are Kakar, Panni, Tarin, Shirani and Achakzai all of whom are split up between Baluchistan and Afghanistan." It is further recorded in Sindh that "according to native accounts, the Parni Afghans came to Sibi (Siwi) in 1470 AD." The same text states that Parni Afghans are also known as "Panni".

2004 saw a considerable change in the direction of Rose's musical output. She recorded a mini-album, originally entitled 'The Free To Be Me E.P' but later renamed simply 'Mini-Album', at Warehouse Studios in Oxford with members of The Fourers. The new recording was very much a rock record, with Kemp playing electric guitar and taking charge of the arrangements and production for the first time in her career.
