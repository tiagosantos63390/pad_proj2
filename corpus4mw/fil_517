TATP has allegedly been used in suicide attacks and in improvised explosive devices. However, TATP is difficult and dangerous to make by a would-be terrorist, for example on a plane, and there is a strong probability that such an attempt would result in the injury or death of the would-be terrorist themselves. It's also difficult to make in sufficient quantities to produce explosions of enough force to do significant damage to aircraft, vehicles, or buildings and, assuming they could obtain the necessary equipment, takes several hours to synthesise and dry out. Due to its high susceptibility to accidental detonation by shock, friction, or sparks, acetone peroxide has earned the nickname "Mother of Satan".

In 1969, Wood created another seminal independent comic, "Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon", intended for his "Sally Forth" military readership as indicated in the ads and indicia. Artists Steve Ditko and Ralph Reese and writer Ron Whyte are credited with primary writer-artist Wood on three features: "Cannon", "The Misfits", and "Dragonella". A second magazine-format issue was published in 1976 by Wood and CPL Gang Publications. Larry Hama, one of Wood's assistants, said, "I did script about three "Sally Forth" stories and a few of the "Cannon"'s. I wrote the main "Sally Forth" story in the first reprint book, which is actually dedicated to me, mostly because I lent Woody the money to publish it".

Mary Miles Minter and her mother were bitterly divided by financial disputes and lawsuits for a time, but they later reconciled. Shelby's initial statements to police about the murder are still characterised as evasive and "obviously filled with lies" about both her daughter's relationship with Taylor and "other matters".
