The Victorian period saw new forms of Hellenism, none more famous than the social theory of Matthew Arnold in his book, "Culture and Anarchy". For Arnold, Hellenism was the opposite of Hebraism. The former term stood for "spontaneity," and for "things as they really are"; the latter term stood for "strictness of conscience," and for "conduct and obedience." Human history, according to Arnold, oscillated between these two modes. Other major figures include Swinburne, Pater, Wilde, and Symonds.

"James Dean" premiered at the 27th Deauville American Film Festival in July 2001. Press conferences were held with the screening, and James Dean's three feature films, "East of Eden", "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant", were also screened at the festival. Turner Network Television (TNT) originally intended to premiere the film on United States national television in June 2001, but the release date for "James Dean" was pushed to August 5, 2001. The film attracted 3.18 million viewers and received generally favorable reviews from critics. "James Dean" was released on DVD in January 2002 by Warner Home Video. David Thomson, reviewing in "The New York Times", felt Franco's performance as Dean gave Baby Boomer audiences a positive sense of nostalgia of the 1950s. James Poniewozik of "Time" magazine also highly praised Franco's performance, but felt the script was overtly cliché. Ken Tucker wrote in "Entertainment Weekly" that "James Dean", alongside "" (2001), was a revolutionary force in the television movie genre.

Let "P" and "Q" be "combinatorially equivalent" 3-dimensional convex polytopes; that is, they are convex polytopes with isomorphic face lattices. Suppose further that each pair of corresponding faces from "P" and "Q" are congruent to each other, i.e. equal up to a rigid motion. Then "P" and "Q" are themselves congruent.
