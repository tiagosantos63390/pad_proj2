Color is not only used in products to attract attention, but also in window displays and stores. When people are exposed to different colored walls and images of window displays and store interiors they tend to be drawn to some colors and not to others. Findings showed that people were physically drawn to warm colored displays; however, they rated cool colored displays as more favorable. This implies that warm colored store displays are more appropriate for spontaneous and unplanned purchases, whereas cool colored displays and store entrances may be a better fit for purchases where a lot of planning and customer deliberation occurs. This is especially relevant in shopping malls were patrons could easily walk into a store that attracts their attention without previous planning.
Abby tries lighting another candle but that wish fails. Celeste appears and says that there are some restrictions on wishing; the candles can only be activated by using a matchbook from the Lucky Duck, a defunct Chinese restaurant where Abby's parents met, and that Abby must wait one hour to elapse before any more wishes can be made. Celeste also says all wishes will be made permanent after midnight. Abby lands the attention of Logan, she's always dreamed of, she gets back at her lifelong nemesis, Krista Cook (Karissa Tynes) by beating her in a volleyball match, then getting elected as Student Body President, even though she didn't sign up for the elections. Also, she becomes suddenly fashionable, athletic, and popular.
