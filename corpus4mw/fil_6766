Harbor City is a highly diverse neighborhood within the Los Angeles Harbor Region of Los Angeles, California, with a population upward of 36,000 people. Originally part of the Rancho San Pedro Spanish land grant, the 2.58-square-mile Harbor City was brought into Los Angeles as a preliminary step in the larger city's consolidation with the port cities of Wilmington and San Pedro.
In 1988 Hot Club Records established the Vintage Guitar Series, which became influential on the international renaissance of the gypsy jazz, inspired by the music of Django Reinhardt. Some artists in this series: Stephane Grappelli, Stochelo Rosenberg, Angelo Debarre, Jon Larsen, Andreas Oberg, Jimmy Rosenberg, and others.
