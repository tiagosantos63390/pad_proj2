The Order of the Golden Kite had served for decades as an auspicious military award of the Japanese armed forces, and was the only Japanese Order that was solely awarded to the military (the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure could be awarded to either military or civilian recipients). However, the process by which Order of the Golden Kite was awarded was very lengthy: it was indeed awarded to military men who had died in service, while the remainder were normally awarded only "after" the end of a war, for services throughout the conflict. As the Second World War dragged on, it became apparent that there was a need to promote morale among active army units by rewarding acts of valor more readily. To this end the IJA suggested the "Bukōchōshō" as an alternate decoration for living recipients who had shown the highest valor in combat, to be awarded much more quickly by division commanders in the field. Emperor Hirohito established the award on 7 December 1944: the three-year anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor which signaled the start of the Pacific War.
