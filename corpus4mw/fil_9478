In 1953, fourteen standard stock motor cars were withdrawn from passenger service, and were converted to ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least three of them were chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.

This allows us to calculate maximum power extraction for a system that includes a rotating wake. This can be shown to give the same value as that of the Betz model i.e. 0.59. This method involves recognising that the torque generated in the rotor is given by the following expression:
