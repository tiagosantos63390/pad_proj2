Originally, guest hosts were given the power of a Raw brand General Manager. However on May 10, 2010 it was announced that all future guest hosts would no longer have that power in a decision made by the Raw general manager Vickie Guerrero who later quit the role that night. Since then, the guest host and general manager roles have been separate, with Bret Hart previously holding the general manager position. In late August 2010, "guest host" role was renamed to "guest star".

In December 1816 Schäffer received an unexpected "reinforcement": the Russian military brig "Rurick" captained by Otto von Kotzebue dropped anchor at Hawaii in the middle of a circumnavigation. Kamehameha, unaware of Kotzebue's true disposition, manned the coast with 400 soldiers (or loyal volunteers, according to Mills) ready to repel the expected landing. Kotzebue managed to persuade the king of his peaceful intentions and made it clear that the Imperial government has nothing to do with Schäffer's delusions; he left without ever visiting his compatriots on Kauai.
