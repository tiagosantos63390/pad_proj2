He succeeded his father as third Baron Henley in 1841 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He was instead elected to the House of Commons for Northampton in 1859, a seat he held until 1874. In 1885 the Northington title held by his great-grandfather was revived when he was created Baron Northington, of Watford in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and the later Barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

Dutch barns often lacked windows and had no openings other than the doors and holes for purple martins to enter. The design of the Dutch barn allows it to have a massive presence, giving it an appearance larger by comparison to other barns.
