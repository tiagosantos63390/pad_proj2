In 13 years as the head football coach, Gary's teams compiled a record of 59–34–5 (.627 winning percentage) and outscored their opponents by a combined total of 1,426 to 683. He twice coached undefeated football teams. His 1932 team compiled a record of 6–0–1 and outscored opponents 174 to 6. That team gave up six points in the first game of the season and held its opponents scoreless in the remaining six games. In his last season as head coach, the 1941 team compiled a perfect record of 8–0 and outscored opponents 183 to 27. At the end of the 1941 season, the Associated Press wrote the following about Gary's 1941 team:"Largest of the small undefeated, untied outfits is Western Michigan College where 2,200 students (but only 700 men) all but went crazy as their heroes tripped Wesern Reserve, Sun Bowl champion, 7–0 in the opener and went on to win seven more. Coach Mitchell J. Gary, who played with Bronko Nagurski at Minnesota, took over as head coach at Western in 1929. He used the T-formation to shake loose Horace Coleman, colored halfback, for 10 touchdowns in seven games."
