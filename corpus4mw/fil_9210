The two parties exchanged a pair of offers as the deadline for a lockout approached. The union's last offer before the expiry of the collective bargaining agreement continued to call for an unlinked salary cap that would steadily increase over a five-year term. Donald Fehr argued that if the league continued to see revenue increase at the seven percent average of the 2005–2012 CBA, the players' share of revenues would drop from the 57 percent they received in 2011–12 to a low of 52 percent in 2015–16, but increase in the final two years of the deal back to 54 percent. The NHL countered with a time-limited offer where it would continue with the existing definition of hockey-related revenue and a linked salary cap that would pay the players 49 percent of revenues in 2012–13 and fall to 47 percent by the sixth year of the deal. Each side rejected the others' offer, and some veteran players expressed willingness to sit out an entire season if necessary. The National Hockey League officially locked its players out when the CBA expired,

"Gimme All (Ring My Bell)" is not only about sexual expression. The singer states that the song reveals her passion about the one who can "ring her bell." In the first verse, she wants to captivate the object of her affection, but towards the end of the song she gets trapped in her own feelings. The bridge is the climax of her desire to possess him that borders on insanity. She says, "I put my blood and tears in this song, because it's the story about my insane passion and love."

Fears of a mole are revived when Ricki Tarr (Bennett), a British agent gone missing in Portugal, turns up in England with new evidence backing up Control's theory whilst not actually identifying the mole. Control had narrowed down the list of suspects to four men – Roy Bland, Toby Esterhase, Bill Haydon and Percy Alleline – all of whom occupy high positions in the Circus. Knowing that the covert Soviet spy enjoys considerable influence in the Circus, the British cannot trust their top spy masters to uncover the mole or even let them know of the investigation. Instead, Smiley is recalled to hunt the mole down.
Prior to the competition, the existing World and Paralympic records were as follows.

In October 2012, the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, announced that Michigan will not issue drivers licenses or state identification of any kind to beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. In making this decision, it was clear that the Secretary of State erroneously conflated the notion of "lawful presence," which is required under Michigan Law to issue a drivers license, and "lawful status," a different legal concept entirely. USCIS has made it clear that DACA beneficiaries do not possess legal status, but does "not" state that DACA beneficiaries are unlawfully present, and in fact, states that DACA beneficiaries will not accrue unlawful presence time here while they are in this deferred action status. The Secretary of State relied upon USCIS' own explanation, which discusses legal status, not lawful presence. In response to this policy, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Secretary Johnson alleging that he policy violated both Michigan Law and the U.S. Constitution. On January 18, 2013, USCIS updated their Frequently Asked Questions about DACA clairifying, among other things, that DACA beneficiaries are, in fact, "lawfully present" in the United States. On February 1, 2013, Secretary Ruth Johnson reversed her policy and began issuing drivers licenses to DACA beneficiaries on February 19, 2013.
