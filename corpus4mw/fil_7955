The main event was a standard wrestling match between Gordy's Fabulous Freebirds teammate P.S. Michael Hayes and Ray Gordy, and the challengers, "Dirty White Boy" Tony Anthony and "Nightmare" Ken Wayne, both among the top "heels" in the Continental Championship Wrestling during the 1980s. Ray Gordy had originally been scheduled to wrestle with his father and Hayes, who had been in retirement since 1995, offered to fill in after Terry's death. Another featured match was "Wildfire" Tommy Rich versus "Nature Boy" Buddy Landel, which Rich won. Robert Gibson defeated "Beautiful" Bobby Eaton, and Jimmy Golden defeated The Honky Tonk Man, with outside interference from Robert Fuller and Robert Gibson, to win the LPW United States Championship.

Chad Fuller was accompanied to the ring by his father Ron Fuller, who was unable to compete due to a shoulder injury, both father and son later turned on the Armstrong's and costing them the match.
Another interesting product of Australian participation in the conflict in South-East Asia was the field modification of L1A1 and L2A1 rifles by the Australian Special Air Service Regiment SASR for better handling. Nicknamed "The Bitch", these rifles were field modified, often from heavy barrel L2A1 automatic rifles, with their barrels cut off right in front of the gas block, and often with the L2A1 bipods removed to install a XM148 40 mm grenade launcher mounted below the barrel. The XM148 40 mm grenade launchers were obtained from U.S. forces. For the L1A1, the lack of fully automatic fire resulted in the unofficial conversion of the L1A1 to full-auto capability by using lower receivers from the L2A1, which works by restricting trigger movement.

Writing in "The Boston Globe", Eric Weinberger offered more nuanced criticism. He finds the first part of the book "credible", arguing that Bawer's "claims are sometimes eccentric, but his critique of the EU and its elites is bracing and commonsensical". The second part, Weinberger characterizes as "alarmist in the way of good pamphlets: The argument is worth having, but any kind of prediction seems too pat. I say "pamphlet" because it is not truly a reporting project ... much of the book's facts, statistics, and quotations clearly come off the Internet." Weinberger also notes the book's lack of sourcing, observing that "There are no footnotes, no bibliography and few citations – strange for a critic trained as a scholar, and a pity, for startling facts require careful verification".
