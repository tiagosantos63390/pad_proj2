Danskøya (Danes island) is first marked on Doncker’s map (1655). It is named after the Danish whalers who resorted there. On the island’s west coast, in "Robbe Bay" (Kobbefjorden), they established a permanent station in 1631, which they occupied until 1658. Robbe Bay is first marked on Dutch maps from Middelhoven’s (1634) to that of Giles and Rep (c. 1710). The latter mapmakers were the first to call it "Danes Bay", while the Danish themselves called it "Copenhagen Bay". The English called the islands southwest point "Gurnerd’s Nose", while the Dutch called it "Engelsche Uytkyk", or English Outlook. The bay in the north coast was called by the Dutch "Houcker Bay", but has been renamed "Virgo Bay" (Virgohamna) after Andrée’s steamer. Off the northeastern coast lays a small island, which the Dutch called "Deadman’s Island", which, as the name suggests, was used as a graveyard by the whalers. It is now known by its Norwegian equivalent, Likholmen (Corpse Island).

The small principality of Andorra selected its participant for Eurovision Song Contest 2008 by using an internal selection. This selection process was criticized by the Association of Andorran Musicians (ASMA) who believed that abandoning the national selection process in favor of an internal selection effectively blocks the public participation of Andorran artists. Nevertheless, RTVA announced that Andorra would be represented by former "Operación Triunfo" contestant, Gisela. On 10 December 2007, the Andorran television broadcaster held a press conference to present Gisela and to announce that the Jordi Cubino composed "Casanova" would be the Andorran theme in Belgrade. The entry in its entirety was presented through the promotional video that aired on February 26, 2008.
It is important to note that Shuja never engaged in conflict but managed his resources and manpower well enough to posture, never to attack. He had at his disposal the richest province in the country but had "problems" like Oudh, marauding Marathas and a weak Mughal Emperor. He preferred sending "supplies" to Delhi rather than "armies" to fight for the declining Mughals. He had advised caution while dealing with Nadir Shah and adopted a "hands off" approach on learning that Nadir had left Persia for Delhi. He however kept on sending a part of his revenue collection to Delhi and unlike the Nawab of Oudh kept away from the court intrigues in the Red Fort. It is ironical that Bengal suffered its worst famines and poverty levels one century later.
