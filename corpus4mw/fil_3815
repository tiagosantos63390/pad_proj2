An important feature of the WER system is the ability for developers to provide fixes for a particular crash bucket and Windows Update is the mechanism that Windows uses to inform the Windows user that there is a fix to the problem that they just reported or that a problem they reported previously has been resolved. Used correctly this system can eliminate the need for the user to have to call a help desk to report the issue and wait for the problem to be researched and then provided with an update that resolves the program they encountered. Since the buckets are organized by a signature of the stack at the point of failure, it is unlikely that this signature will look the same for two different issues. Solutions are mapping to buckets so when a stack trace is reported with the same signature the user can be informed in real time if there is fix to the crash (or hang) that maps to that particular bucket. Fixes for qualified drivers are distributed via Windows Update and if an issue that previously did not have a solution will be remembered so when a fix becomes available the end user will be informed that there is a fix that resolves the previously reported issue.
