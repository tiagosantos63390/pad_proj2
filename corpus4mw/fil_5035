Blood Covenant is an Indian metal band, considered the pioneers of metal in South India from Chennai, formed in 2005. The band was a major force in the death metal, thrash metal and christian metal genres in India starting from the late 1990s because of its vocalist Eddie's earlier bands like Bonesaw. Their later experiments draw influence from black metal. Currently the band's sound is a mix of Swedish death metal and Brazilian thrash metal forming into Blood Covenant's own thrash/death style. The band's current line up consists of vocalist Eddie Prithviraj, guitarist Ronald Nathanael, bassist Sibi Boycott Walter and drummer Brijesh Sereno.
