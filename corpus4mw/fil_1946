Mabel had to have a formal outfit in reserve for her husband in order to create an image that her side of the family had a more expensive taste in apparel. This one-time gag appeared on the August 28, 1997 episode of the comic strip. Mike was chosen to wear an effeminate white tie outfit consisting of a black jacket, white bow tie, white tuxedo shirt, white vest and black formal trousers for Abel and Buffy's visit. The effeminate outfit somehow got a flaw in it from Mike struggling to get it on; making him look like a fool in front of his in-laws. After the visit is over, even Mabel is glad to see her brother and his wife leave the house. Mabel is lying down in the couch all exhausted because she had to keep up with what Abel and Buffy were doing to her house.

During the height of their reign, Antiope and Hippolyta came across a mother and daughter on horseback. The older diseased woman introduced herself as Queen Hypsipyle, and her daughter as Princess Phthia. They ruled the island of Lemnos in a matriarchal society similar to the Amazons of Themyscira.
