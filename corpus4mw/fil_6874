Suyá musical performances are mainly vocal. Musical instruments play a very small role in Suyá culture, although they are occasionally used. The most frequently used are idiophones, which accompany singing and dancing. The first is "hwin krā", a rattle made of individual piqui ("Caryocar coriaceum") pits strung together on a central string with hand-spun cotton or sometimes burity-palm fiber. This may be held in the hands or tied to the knees so that the rattle makes a sound with each step. Some of these rattles are also made from deer, tapir, or wild-pig hoofs. A gourd rattle is also played in certain ceremonies. This rattle is made from a gourd partly filled with seeds, with a wooden shaft going through the middle, decorated with a band of young macaw feathers around the middle and a few parrot-wing feathers hanging from a string attached to the tip of the staff.
