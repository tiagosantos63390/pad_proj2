The aqueduct was opened to traffic on 17 July 1761, only 15 months after the enabling Act had been passed, and it was soon being used by the duke's barges to carry coal to Manchester from his mines at Worsley. The construction of the aqueduct excited great admiration, and writers of the day often remarked on the strange and novel sight afforded by the canal where it crossed the Irwell. The structure became one of the wonders of the age and crowds came from all over the country to view it, along with the drilling of the sough for the duke's Worsley navigable levels. Those who saw it were often struck by the advantages of still-water navigation when they saw ten or twelve men slowly hauling a single barge against the flow of the Irwell, while above a horse, mule, or perhaps two men, could be seen hauling several linked barges across the still waters of the aqueduct.

Preseason started on 20 July with a loss in Segovia against English squad Brighton & Hove Albion by 1–2. Four days later, Sporting played its first game in Asturias against Marino de Luanco and solved it with an easy win by 3–0. Stefan Šćepović with two goals.
