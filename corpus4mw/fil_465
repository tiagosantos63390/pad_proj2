After her return to Japan, "Hōshō" was transferred to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board "Hōshō". On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both "Hōshō" and "Ryūhō" were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, "Hōshō" was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, "Hōshō" shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, "a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature" (cf. ). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being "the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.

The school newspaper, "The Towerlight", announced that in February 2008, the school administration was planning to implement a "Free Speech Policy". Within the policy, it defines several things that would be considered free speech, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests. This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well. Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels it is a mistake to exclude students from the decision making process. It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the "Student Leadership Council" that consists of student leaders who are in charge of large student groups. Several of the students contested that not only did they not know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not even know that kind of committee even existed.
Design of fullface masks (underwater, land, gasmasks) in movies is sometimes constrained by desire to show the actor's face to the camera. There have been cases of fullface masks used in movie filming having a light inside shining on the actor's face so the face shows on camera better: a feature that is no use whatever in practical breathing mask use.

Amongst the key early "Fortean Times" advocates and supporters, Rickard cites Ion Will, a "constant of valuable clippings, books, postcards and entertaining letters"; Janet and Colin Bord, authors of "Mysterious Britain" (among other titles and articles - an article by Colin in "Gandalf's Garden" is particularly cited by Rickard as being overtly Fortean) and cartoonist Hunt Emerson, introduced to Rickard when in late 1974 (after seven issues) he "wanted to improve the graphics", which Emerson certainly did (Indeed, Emerson's still-on-going monthly "Phenomenomix" strip in "FT" had its prototype in #11's three-page "Fortean Funnies").
