Most of the students know only their mother tongue: Finnish and do not know any English.
Substituting "x"′ = 0 corresponding to "x" = "vt" and noting that the relative velocity is "v" = "bc"/"γ", this gives 
The story is representative of the positivism in Poland period in Polish literature, focusing on social injustice and the wasted life chances for peasant children. Other themes include the folk beliefs and superstitions of uneducated peasantry. The story focuses on the unfair treatment of a child, Janko. Janko is a peasant child, gifted by musical talent, who becomes fascinated by the fiddle he hears from a nearby noble manor. He sneaks to the manor to touch them, is captured, sentenced to flagellation, and dies from injuries suffered.

In youth, Jorge is sent to Batatais, where he entered the diocesan seminary, with a strong desire to become a priest. Writes there, his first verses discovering his talent for poetry.
Being able to position a data signal relative to a clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in a BERT. This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds to the middle of the data signal's bit window, since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched. The capability is also used on the receiver side of a BERT where a separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data signal's bit cell. As the clock signal approaches either side of the data bit cell window, the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals. This type of analysis is called a "Bathtub Curve," which demonstrates a degree of system margin. This is an example of a signal integrity physical-layer test, utilizing BER measurement capability combined with accurate time delay capability.
