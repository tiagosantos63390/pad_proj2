The Clifford Day Mallory Cup, or Mallory Cup for short, is the competition for the United States Adult Sailing Championship. In a sport with hundreds of different classes of boats and a national champion for each, the point of the Mallory Cup is to determine an overall champion for the sport of sailing. Run by the U.S. Sailing Association (as opposed to any given class), eliminations are held throughout the country, and the finals are raced in a different type of boat each year to eliminate any advantage a sailor from any particular class might otherwise have. Competitors sail boats that are provided by the host club, and teams are required to race each boat at the event once so that nobody will have an advantage in terms of equipment.
The SAT Operating System was written and released as a beta version in March 2005 in time for the very first version of the "New SAT". The new SAT ushered in new types of mathematics problems, while others were discarded. "SAT_OS" incorporates almost all of the most recent mathematical equations, problems solving functions, and tools into a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). So far there have been two unique versions of the SAT Operating System: one for the TI-89/Titanium graphing calculators and one for the TI-83+/84+/Silver Edition(s) graphing calculators. The version compatible with TI-83+/84+/Silver Edition graphing calculators was released on 5/3/11. The software is no longer in beta and is now owned and maintained by Calc-TechTM LLC.

The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement, beginning "The Wikileaks phenomenon — the existence of an organization devoted to obtaining and publicly releasing large troves of information the U.S. government would prefer to keep secret — illustrates just how broken our secrecy classification system is. While the Obama administration has made some modest improvements to the rules governing classification of government information, both it and the Bush administration have overclassified and kept secret information that should be subject to public scrutiny and debate. As a result, the American public has had to depend on leaks to the news media and whistleblowers to know what the government is up to".
