History.
Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone arch bridge that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, connecting the two halves of the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse.
The group's second album was called "Change Or Die", and from it, the band released the singles "When" (U.S. Dance #1), "Exodus," "White Skies," "Secrets," and "Looking at You" (U.S. Dance #2). Despite all these singles, the album was not commercially released in major territories outside the UK, and the band therefore negotiated its release from its Sony Music contract. Their next release was a mainly instrumental limited-edition CD called "New Dark Times", issued on the band's own Kali labeli, which combined new material with tracks from the Anna Series and remixes from "Change Or Die".
