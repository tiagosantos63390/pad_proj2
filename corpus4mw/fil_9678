Labor Day is one of the official holidays in Bulgaria where it is known as "Labor Day and International Workers' Solidarity Day" ("Ден на труда и на международната работническа солидарност"). The first attempt to celebrate it was in 1890 by the Bulgarian Topographical Association. In 1939, Labour Day was declared an official holiday.
