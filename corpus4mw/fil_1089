The Nuremburg Laws, also known as the Anti-Jewish laws, were statutes created in Germany for the purpose of maintaining blood purity of the Aryan race. The laws indicating the necessity of obtaining a German Blood Certificate was implemented at the time relationships between Aryan and Jews were outlawed. German Blood Certificates were documentations that classified who was of "German or related blood". Aryans could face a prison sentence if they were to go against the established laws. Aryan and Jewish families already married with children were labeled as Mischling, and thus were encouraged to divorce. Such relationships were deemed as "blood treason". The Nuremburg Laws did not define people as Jewish by cultural values, but rather looked at the how many generations of Jewish grandparents were before them. Specifically, those who had three or four generations of Jewish grandparents were considered Jews, despite any conversions to Christianity. Jewish blood was considered to be inferior by the Nazi, thus they saw the need to segregate the Jews from the German community. As a result of the Nuremburg Laws, Jewish people were denied German citizenships even though Germany was their homeland. The establishment of the Nuremburg Laws paved the path towards the Holocaust.

Overview.
The name Gislebertus, the Latin for "Gilbert" (and for other "Gilberts" more usually spelt as the variants above), is found carved on the west tympanum of Autun Cathedral: "Gislebertus hoc fecit" or "Gislebertus made this." Some scholars today believe that this is actually the name of the patron who commissioned the work, rather than that of the artist. The lead sculptor would in any case have had a number of assistants, though the distinctive designs may well have been the work of a single hand. Gislebertus' name is the first ever found on stone work from the Romanesque period, as the sculptors before him believed themselves to be working for God, instead of themselves being creative individuals. On the other hand, Grivot and Zarnecki state, ""Signatures of this kind were not unusual in the Romanesque period. What is surprising about this one is its position and importance. Earlier examples in France were placed unobtrusively either at the base of a column or more frequently on a capitol.""
