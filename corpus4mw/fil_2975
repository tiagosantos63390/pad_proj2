Mrs. White’s opinions regarding her own inspiration maintain a distinction between her own common fallible opinion as compared to the infallible opinion of God when He communicates a message to mankind. When speaking of God and His message given to prophets she strongly affirms infallible inspiration but when speaking of her own opinions she does not claim infallibility, and cites the Bible and God as the only source of perfection. In some cases she’ll make statements such as:
In his youth, Jean Louis took part in a winner take all tournament to the death. In the final Jean-Louis, a slight man of around 5' 2", duelled for 1 whole hour with a Spanish opponent who was 6 ft tall. Then as the Spaniard lost concentration Jean-Louis finished him.
Death.

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 4.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 4.0%. Out of the forested land, 15.6% of the total land area is heavily forested and 5.3% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 52.8% is used for growing crops and 10.3% is pastures, while 1.7% is used for orchards or vine crops. Of the water in the municipality, 1.7% is in lakes and 1.0% is in rivers and streams.

Among the things the main claims to know or be able to do are: drilling for oil in the Bass Strait, being able to prove Einstein's theory wrong, predicting mankind's fate and knowing what really happened in regards to Marilyn Monroe's death.
