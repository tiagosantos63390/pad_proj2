Demographics.
He was born in Steno, Arcadia. He competed for a Greece in the 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, in the discus throw where he won the Bronze medal. 
All six of the country's individual event competitors reached the finals; none won a medal. All three of the country's team event squads reached the finals; they won a gold medal in the sabre and a bronze in the épée. The team sabre competition pitted the defending champion Italian squad against a powerhouse Hungary team which had been excluded from competition in 1920. The four-team final pool was dominated by the two teams, and the match between them decided gold. That match was one of the closest of the 1924 Games, with the teams splitting the bouts 8 to 8 and Italy winning via tie-breaker: 50 touches to 46.

The following season he traveled to Central America to join Guatemalan champions CSD Comunicaciones, and was a symbol on this club that is the best in the area.

Throughout the 1990s, Ukraine retained much Soviet-era army equipment. Since then, however, Ukraine has upgraded its Ground Forces with advanced additions from domestic engineering and modifications. Currently, the Ukrainian Ground Forces buys military equipment only from Russia and other CIS states, as well as locally producing some of their own equipment.
