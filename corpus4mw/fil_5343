In 1933, Evans’s relationship with Lloyd George had not yet descended into ruin. He approached Lloyd George with a proposal that he should write a biography of the former prime minister in Welsh and they had dinner together at the House of Commons to discuss it. But according to Lloyd George’s principal private secretary, A J Sylvester, Lloyd George discouraged Evans from this project and certainly the book was never published. But in the course of their conversation Evans managed to extract from Lloyd George an admission of regret that he had not done more to stop the Passchendaele offensive of 1917 which resulted in tremendous loss of Allied life. Lloyd George said he failed to act to stop the battle because he did not wish to be accused if interfering as prime minister directly with the military decisions of his soldiers, particularly General Jan Smuts who was in favour of the operation.

The Hubley Manufacturing Company made accurate metal replicas of many popular American cars and trucks, with some foreign models also represented. Construction, farm, and fire vehicles were commonly produced, as well as motorcycles. A couple of earlier examples were a detailed 1934 Chrysler Airflow, a 1934 Ford coupe, and a 1930s Studebaker. In good condition, Hubley's 1937 Lincoln-Zephyr pulling a trailer can bring in several hundred dollars (see O'Brien, 1994 for a more detailed history of Hubley vehicles). Up through the 1950s, the emphasis was on children's toys, though some of these so-called "toys" could be fairly sophisticated, like the eleven and a half inch long Indian 'crash car' cast iron motorcycle complete with parts and accessories, or a fairly complex tow truck.

Sonia Murray of "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" dubbed the album "the most versatile and efficacious of the trio's four albums" and stated, ""House of Music" draws emoting tips from '60s Sam Cooke; its musicianship is powered to compete with the Earth Wind & Fire of the '70s, and its funk wrenches sweat like the early '80s work of Cameo and Brick. But in a nod to Tony Toni Tone's inventiveness, it still manages to make each masterful re-creation new and meaningful." J.D. Considine of "The Baltimore Sun" felt that it "is hardly a throwback [...] Instead, the Tonies serve as a sort of stylistic missing link, suggesting what would have happened had the soul styles of the '70s continued to evolve, instead of being tossed aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s." Michael A. Gonzales of "Vibe" commended the group for "us their elders as sketches for their personalized, complete sound paintings," writing that "Like a blaxploitation flick soundtrack, "House of Music" glows a vision of blackness that is superbad, mad smooth, and crazy sexy." Gonzales described it as "a wonderland of harmonic delights, softcore jollies, and slow-jam fever floating on the tip of Cupid's arrow" and wrote that it "shows the group exploring the sensuality of black pop without sounding like boulevard bullies stalking their objects of desire."

Clofazimine is given to treat sulfone-resistant leprosy or to patients who are intolerant to sulfones. It also exerts an antiinflammatory effect and prevents erythema nodosum leprosum, which can interrupt treatment with dapsone. This is a major advantage of clofazimine over other antileprosy drugs. Ulcerative lesions caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans respond well to clofazimine. It also has some activity against M. tuberculosis and can be used as last resort therapy for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis. The most disturbing adverse reaction to clofazimine is a red-brown discoloration of the skin, especially in
