Originally, Lurie had agreed to sell the Giants for $115 million to an ownership group headed by Vince Naimoli (original owner of the Tampa Bay Rays) with plans to move the club to St. Petersburg, Florida. However, the National League nixed the deal, pressuring Lurie to sell the club to Bay Area investors. In an 11th hour effort to save the team from moving, a group of local investors headed by ex-Safeway magnate, Peter Magowan, offered Lurie $100 million for the Giants.
The original section of the railway line from Wallisellen to Uster was opened in 1856 by the Glatttalbahn company. That company was taken over by the Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen (VSB) one year later in 1857, and that company extended the line to Rapperswil. The VSB was in turn taken over by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1902. The original roundhouse at Uster railway station is preserved.

Juniper has historically been used as both a boys and girls name. In the early part of the 20th century it was often seen as a boys name, likely due to Saint Juniper, but currently the name is more popular as a girls name. Juniper has never been on the top 1000 list, but is an increasingly popular name likely due to the popularity of a wide assortment of well-known fictional works, including the cartoon series "The Life and Times of Juniper Lee," the movie "Benny and Joon" (where the Joon character was short for Juniper), and the novel "Juniper, Gentian, and Rosemary."
