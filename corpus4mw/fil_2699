Synopsis.
Whilst the 1960 rainy season over the affected region had not been excessively dry, rainfall had been below average over the region affected by the fires ever since August of that year - thus the forests were perhaps even drier than they would normally be by January. However, the underlying cause of the Dwellingup fires lay far to the north in the Pilbara, where a tropical cyclone formed on 18 January north of Onslow and moved steadily southwards, hitting that town on 20 January. With a strong high pressure system to the east of the cyclone remaining almost stationary for some days, hot north-easterly winds developed and became so intense that by the 20th maximum temperatures throughout the south west were uniformly above and remained at that level for the following five days. During this period, the cyclone moved slowly along the coast and as it drenched Onslow and the neighbouring district, only dry thunderstorms occurred in the south-west, which started fires that spread extremely rapidly in the hot, windy conditions.
