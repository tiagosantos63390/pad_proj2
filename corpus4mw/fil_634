The two sides remained at a stalemate between the Kaesong to Seoul line for the next couple of months and both sides were unable and unwilling to commit to further offensives. The Japanese were still unable to gain sufficient supplies to move north, and the defeat at Pyongyang had caused part of the Japanese leadership such as Konishi Yukinaga and Ishida Mitsunari to seriously consider negotiating with the Ming dynasty forces.
