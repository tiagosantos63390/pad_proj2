The south wall is considered the highest rock face of the Balkan peninsula and in the summer of 2010 was a tourist hotspot for the first time by a majority of tourists coming from Germany, especially big wall climbers throughout Europe.

In 29 July 1976, over a thousand students from The University of Queensland marched against Australian Government's financial assistance scheme for student, known as the Tertiary Education Scheme(TEAS) in Brisbane's central business district. Those students were on the side of better Federal Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances for students and against the government's decision on Federal education budget cuts. Bjelke-Petersen instructed the police not to grant a permit for the march, and the police stopped the march along Coronation Drive. An officer struck Rose Marie Severin, who was a female student in the head with a baton during the struggle. This was recorded and reported on television that night and gave Severin a complicated time as a public figure regardless of her choice. A student quoted on the The Courier-Mail reported that she was not a radical; she was only trying to get out of the situation when she got a crack on the head from behind. QCCL attempted to take legal action on behalf of Severin but she reluctantly dropped the charges because she did not want any more publicity in the middle of university exams so the case did not continue any further.

Smith was raised in Mississippi, but later relocated to East St. Louis, Detroit and finally Chicago. He obtained his stage name from Homesick James in 1958, after the pair had worked together. Smith sang in front of various blues bands around Chicago for many years, having been initially influenced by Joe Williams, Jimmy Witherspoon and Brook Benton. He finally made his recording debut in 1991, providing the vocals on Dave Specter's first album, "Bluebird Blues". His connection with Delmark Records then continued when they issued Smith's own solo debut, "Gotcha!", in 1994. "Gotcha!" featured guitar work by Steve Freund.

In spite of playing the second half against Wimbledon with ten men after the dismissal of Luzhny, Arsenal defeated their London rivals by three goals to one. Before the game away to Leeds United on 16 April 2000, both clubs observed a minute's silence to honour the two Leeds fans who were murdered in Istanbul. Wenger and his players then presented bouquets of flowers to their counterparts. Arsenal went ahead in the 21st minute – Henry beat defender Jonathan Woodgate for pace and scored his 20th goal of the season. Further goals by Keown, Kanu and Overmars resulted in a 4–0 win and lifted Arsenal above Leeds into third, with a better goal difference. Arsenal beat Watford and continued their strong finish to the season with a 1–0 win at Everton to move into second place. Wenger believed Manchester United, who retained their status as champions in April, had benefited from the league being "organised" in their favour: "They had a winter break. They didn't play in the FA Cup. It was all wrong from the start. The break was good for them because at the same time we dropped points and so did the other teams. So when they came back they had the psychological advantage."

Teufel was born on June 17, 1943, in Ingelheim and was raised in Ludwigsburg. He attended the Free University of Berlin, studying German literature and theater, which also allowed him to avoid conscription. In January 1967 Teufel, together with Dieter Kunzelmann and other radicals, founded Kommune 1 in West Berlin on Stuttgarter Platz, the nation's first politically motivated commune. Teufel was one of the instigators of what became known as the "Pudding Assassination", in which protesters planned to throw plastic bags filled with flour, pudding and yogurt at Vice President of the United States Hubert H. Humphrey, during an April 1967 state visit. 11 participants in the "plot" were arrested, but were quickly released, and Teufel was on his way to becoming a celebrity.
