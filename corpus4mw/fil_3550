It is most important not to use any 90° connection within the pipe work. This refers to any main or branch lines connections as well as to horizontal direction changes. Only wye-fittings and 45° bends may be used. Using 90° connection will lead to blockages within the system and may create a water hammer with temporarily pressure drops affecting the equipment.
With BAFANL opting to move from a single 6-team Premier to a split 6 North/6 South Premier for the 2012 season, The Pirates were places in the Northern conference, alongside the Yorkshire Rams, Doncaster Mustangs, Leicester Falcons, Tamworth Phoenix and Birmingham Bulls. The season was successful on the field for the team, but a number of the other Northern teams had significant problems, leading 4 games being cancelled (Doncaster away, both Leicester fixtures and Birmingham at home). The Pirates went 5-1 on the field (9-1 when forfeits were added in) and topped the conference, earning a bye into the semi final. The London Blitz travelled up to play the Pirates in their fourth ever meeting and the night before the game, their bus was set robbed and on fire! On the day, the pirates took a 7-0 lead, before falling 14-7 behind and then regaining a 17-14 lead in the 4th quarter. With only minutes to go, the Blitz took a 21-17 lead and the Pirates, whilst driving down the field, fumbled the ball away on their final possession, allowing the Blitz to kneel out the game. Despite the setback, it was a strong showing and proof that the Pirates were a good fit in the Premier Division.

History.

Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey, respectively. Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a "perfect fit" for the character during the first casting session. Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski was chosen for the female lead role of what was then CIA officer Sarah Kent in the same month. Casting continued throughout March with Sarah Lancaster, Joshua Gomez, and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr. Ellie Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla Hart (Chuck's neighbor and love interest), respectively. The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck. Morgan's surname was later changed to "Grimes" and Sarah's surname was changed to "Walker".

In July 2008, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown compared himself to the character, saying that he was "Maybe an older Heathcliff, a wiser Heathcliff." The comparison was mocked by some. For example, Andrew McCarthy, acting director of the Brontë Parsonage Museum, said that "Heathcliff is a man prone to domestic violence, kidnapping, possible murder and digging up his dead lover. He is moody and unkind to animals. Is this really a good role model for the prime minister?"

He voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), holding that it increased the size of government, eroded U.S. sovereignty, and was unconstitutional. He has also voted against the Australia–U.S. FTA, the U.S.–Singapore FTA, and the U.S.–Chile FTA, and voted to withdraw from the WTO. He believes that "fast track" powers, given by Congress to the President to devise and negotiate FTAs on the country's behalf, are unconstitutional, and that Congress, rather than the executive branch, should construct FTAs.
