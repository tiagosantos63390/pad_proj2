He began his musical studies with his father and performed in his first professional engagements on saxophone at age eleven. He graduated from the Royal Conservatory of Music in Madrid, where he studied clarinet, piano, and harmony.
According to the references and descriptions of Gidas during this period, it was the largest village in the area of Roumlouki, although the area was generally sparsely populated throughout the centuries. Since the local people were subjugated to the Ottomans, they were charged with heavy taxes, which varied from period to period according to the taxation in the Ottoman empire, and as a consequence there was a general resentment towards the Ottomans. The local people were allowed to keep their religion and language, that is they were mostly Orthodox Christians and spoke the Greek language, although many people turned into Muslims so that they could gain the special privileges granted to Muslims. By being a rural area as well as a feudal property, it meant that the people of Gidas were mostly peasants and animal husbandmen, although there were also merchants trading all local kinds of commodities, and there was also a school.

As a British officer, Duquesne returned to Cape Town with secret plans to sabotage strategic British installations and to kill Kitchener. He recruited 20 Boer men, but was betrayed by the wife of one. On 11 October 1901, while attending a dinner for Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, the Cape Colony governor, he was arrested in full dress uniform for "conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage." He was court-martialled as a lieutenant in the British army and sentenced to be shot along with his co-conspirators. The other 20 members of his team were executed by firing squad the next day, but as a plea-bargain his sentence was reduced to life in prison and in exchange Duquesne agreed to divulge secret Boer codes and to translate several Boer dispatches. According to Ronnie, "for the rest of his life he swore he never betrayed the Boer cause but actually created new codes that would mislead the British."
