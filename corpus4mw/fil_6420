"Off Armageddon Reef" begins with a prologue where the humans are making a last-ditch effort to preserve at least some humans from the genocidal Gbaba. The Gbaba, however, are found to have located all of the colony ships sent out by the humans up to that point, and the humans make one more attempt to relocate a colony to a new location, eventually dubbed "Safehold" by the leaders of the colonial expedition. Once they arrive there, there is a disagreement between different factions in the leadership of the colonists, and one of the factions murders the others after brainwashing all of the colonists in cryogenic sleep. The brainwashing leads the colonists to believe they were suddenly created by the "Archangel Langhorne" (who was the original commander of the colony, Erik Langhorne) and his likeminded faction. Langhorne gives the colonists a religious book, known as the "Holy Writ". One chapter of the book, known as the Proscriptions of Jwo Jeng, specifically forbade certain types of technological advances in an attempt to keep the Gbaba from detecting this last colony. He and his faction create a religion—Church of God Awaiting—centered around themselves as archangels, along with strict punishment for anyone who steps outside the rules they have given.
"Hello Stranger" was written by Barbara Lewis herself, who was originally inspired to write a song with that title while working gigs in Detroit with her musician father: “I would make the circuit with my dad and people would yell out: ‘Hey stranger, hello stranger, it’s been a long time’". The song is notable because its title comprises the first two words of the lyrics but is never at any point repeated throughout the rest of the song.
