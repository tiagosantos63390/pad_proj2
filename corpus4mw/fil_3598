Mounted Battle Command On The Move (MBCOTM) is a former program of the United States Army that was managed by the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications Tactical (PEO C3T). MBCOTM had the stated goal of "enabling the Tactical Commander to exercise effective Command and Control by moving to the Decisive Point on the battlefield with the same level of Situational Understanding heretofore available only within a fixed command post." This was accomplished by putting a command and control system such as an Army Battle Command System, CPOF, C2PC, and/or DTCS along with extensive communication gear in a Stryker, HMMWV, or Bradley and locating it in a forward-deployed location.

The mansion was abandoned by the time Henry Riter acquired it and operated it as a resort until 1946. The building is currently owned and operated by the Washoe County Parks Department. Some 500 Nevada families have donated period furniture housed in the mansion. The park blends the historical site with recreational facilities such as a spring-fed swimming pool, picnic areas, and a playground. Tours of the mansion are given in summer and autumn.
