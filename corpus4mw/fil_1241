In Chicago's early years, Lamm used a simple setup of Hammond organ and Hohner Pianet electric piano, although he did use a Wurlitzer electric piano from time to time in the studio and on stage. Initially, his use of the grand piano was limited to the studio until he began to use one more regularly on stage, although it is likely that he just used whatever concert venues supplied him with rather than go through the inconvenience of lugging a grand piano around on tour. He was seen at a concert with an RMI Electra Piano on top of his Hammond organ, but he soon switched to a Fender Rhodes electric piano around 1972. In 1974, he started to use a Mellotron and Hohner clavinet in his keyboard rig and also incorporated Moog and ARP synthesizers into his rig. In the studio, he also experimented with tack piano, vibraphone and possibly harmonium, harpsichord and celesta. In the late 70's, he also started using the Yamaha CS80 synthesizer and in the 80's, switched to the Yamaha CP70 electric grand piano and possibly Prophet 5, Yamaha DX7 and Fairlight CMI keyboards. On a TV appearance in 1980, he was seen playing piano and having a Multimoog on top of his grand piano. He has since used a Roland AX-7 keyboard and currently uses a Yamaha Motif ES8 keyboard.

Both Takoma, D.C., and Takoma Park, Maryland, were noted regionally and nationally for progressive politics dating from the 1960s, when area residents (led by future Takoma Park, MD mayor Sam Abbott) rallied to prevent a 10-lane freeway from bisecting the community, and lobbied to build the Metrorail system, near the site of the former B&O railroad station around which the community had been built. However, much of the land adjacent to the station was demolished or neglected in the wake of the freeway controversy, creating division between downtown Takoma Park, MD and the center of the Takoma community, which roughly parallels the D.C. line. Both of the remaining areas, on either side of the D.C.-Maryland line, are now protected as U.S. Historic Districts.
