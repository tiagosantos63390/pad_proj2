Production.
In 2009 and 2010, Quick Pitch was exclusively a single-host program with Hazel Mae hosting Sunday-Thursday and Matt Yaloff hosting Friday and Saturday. For the 2011 season, Mae and Yaloff moved to a new afternoon program, "The Rundown". Newly hired anchor Paul Severino anchored the Monday and Wednesday editions of the show in 2011, and fellow newly hired anchor Ahmed Fareed anchored Thursday-Sunday that same year. Lisa Kerney served as a frequent Sunday night and fill-in anchor in 2011. With the addition of several new reporters, the hosting work of Quick Pitch was split between five different anchors in 2012, including Fareed, Severino, Greg Amsinger, Scott Braun, and Alanna Rizzo, with Sam Ryan acting as a fill-in anchor.
