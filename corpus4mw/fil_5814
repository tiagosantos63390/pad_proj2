The Village of Karimkunnam falls in the Idukki District of the state of Kerala in India. The place has its own history which can be traced to 1000 A.D. As of 2001 India census, Karimkunnam had a population of 12188 people. The prosperity of karimkunnam starts in 1970’s with the arrival of high yield rubber plants. The introduction of rubber plants into the fertile land of karimkunnam proved a success. Farmers who were depend on paddy and other food crops turned to rubber cultivation. This revolution gave enough money for the local people which enabled them to provide better education for their children.


The fifth and final phase was meant for the preparation of annual plans for block and district panchayats by integrating the lower level plans and, presumably, to developing their own plans that would be complementary to the village panchayat plans. Due to the delays and inadequacies in the preparation of village panchayat plans, this exercise could not be undertaken. To quote the Kerala State Planning Board, the lead agency: ‘As a result, there were many instances of duplication of planning activities and also critical gaps between the various tiers’. Even when projects and plans were available, it was realised that most of them had to be examined closely for their ‘technical soundness and viability.’ This led to another phase leading to the formation of expert committees and project appraisal teams to scrutinise and approve the projects and plans.
