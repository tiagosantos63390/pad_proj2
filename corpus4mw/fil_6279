The Society for Court Studies is a learned society that aims to stimulate and co-ordinate the study of royal, princely, and noble courts from the late Middle Ages to the present. The principal object of the Society is to examine courts from a multi-disciplinary perspective by focusing on a variety of areas such as architectural history, political history, military history, art history, cultural patronage, and the role of women in courts. The Society for Court Studies publishes its own scientific and peer-reviewed journal, "The Court Historian", which appears twice a year.
