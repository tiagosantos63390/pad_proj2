All these statistics are vital and conducive to progress in the educational system of America. However, Clarion-Limestone offers more than numbers and faculty with decorated resumes. The solid light brown bricks of the elementary and high school fail to keep quiet about the many memories which happen within their comforting classrooms. The lessons taught here are not only educational, and they are not bound to teacher student interactions. Custodians, administrators, guest visitors, coaches, librarians, receptionists, bus drivers and many other persons who interact with the students show great enthusiasm for their care, protection, and happiness. For generations, children who grew up here can gladly speak of how they were taught how to behave, how to react, how to share, how to resolve conflict, how to find joy, how to make mistakes yet recover, how to find love within a world which struggles to see the power of love. Clarion-Limestone is a school with character, with integrity, with passion, with tears, with laughter, with heroines and heroes.
