One noted trend in Irish newspapers is the presence of Irish editions of UK newspapers, these include "The Irish Sun", "Irish Mirror", "Irish News of the World", and the Irish edition of "The Sunday Times", the only one of the Irish editions that is of a broadsheet newspaper. The "Irish Daily Star" also is sometimes placed in this category, though it has a far greater Irish content than the other UK editions, and is also 50% owned by Independent News and Media. Following the success of "Ireland on Sunday" (an Irish version of the Mail on Sunday), the Irish Daily Mail was launched in February 2006, with "Ireland on Sunday" itself being rebranded "The Irish Mail on Sunday" in September 2006.

2009 was not much better for the Kings. In their second season in the amateur ranks they managed just four wins in a difficult season – a 2–0 win over the Indiana Invaders in May, a pair of 3–1 wins over Fort Wayne Fever in June, and a 3–2 win over Toronto Lynx in July in which substitute Judson McKinney scored a last minute winner. The rest of the year was a disappointment, especially on the defensive end; they conceded three goals on five separate occasions, including four of their first five games of the season. Their worst defeat of the season was the 5–1 thrashing they suffered at the hands of Chicago Fire Premier in July. The Kings finished the season in 8th place in the Great Lakes division, decisively out of the playoffs; Judson McKinney was the team's top scorer, with four goals, while Aaron Miller and Jonathan Sutton contributed two assists each.

Background and construction.
During the antebellum period, Germans displayed a complex set of opinions on slavery and secession. There were several Germans who owned slaves, and some eventually supported Texas secession from the United States. Most Germans, however were apathetic to slavery. A vocal minority of Germans was actively antagonistic to the institution of slavery. These antagonistic Germans included liberal and republican-minded Germans known as "Achtundvierziger" or Forty-Eighters. Many Forty-Eighters supported federal authority and opposed slavery. Most Anglo Texans found this to be an affront to a legal institution. German opposition to slavery led to an animosity between the two groups throughout the 1850s. These disputes were magnified by Texas secession from the United States in March 1861 and the start of the American Civil War on April 12, 1861.
