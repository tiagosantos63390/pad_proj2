All these arrested persons were executed on 17 March 1945. Only one week later, on 24 March 1945, Kjell Bull-Hansen and Odd Isøy were captured by coincidence; Isøy managed to escape whereas Bull-Hansen was killed escaping. Other personnel, including William Houlder and Per Røed, were wounded during Aks 13000's existence.
