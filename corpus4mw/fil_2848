The song "Varning På Stan" ("Danger Downtown") became Uggla's first hit single and was later recorded in English with the name "Hit the Girls on the Run". Uggla has stated that he was inspired by Mott the Hoople's song "All the Way from Memphis" when he wrote "Varning På Stan".
During the 2008 NFL game against Mayo, Donaghy made a "middle finger" gesture to their fans. He was punished with a one match suspension for the incident. He apologised for the incident as follows: "During the latter stages of the game and in the heat of the moment, I used an inappropriate gesture towards the crowd. I apologise unreservedly to spectators and all sports fans alike for any offence that I may have caused by this action." Kerry reached the 2008 NFL final, but were beaten by Derry. Then Cork beat Kerry in the 2008 Munster final. Kerry still managed to reach the All-Ireland final but came undone against Tyrone who won the game by four points. Donaghy managed a second All Star that year.
