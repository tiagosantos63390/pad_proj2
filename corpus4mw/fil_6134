When Arsène Wenger joined Arsenal in October 1996, he attempted to organise an extra training session at the club's University College London Union (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds, for the benefit of getting to know his players. Wenger was told that the ground – owned by UCL, was reserved for its students, which left him not knowing “whether to laugh or cry”. A few weeks after, a fire partially burnt down the training centre, costing £50,000 in damages. Arsenal temporarily rehoused their training base to Sopwell House Hotel in St Albans. Wenger, dismayed by the arrangement, campaigned for a purpose-built, Arsenal-owned ground that housed the latest training equipment. This was one of the "important decisions" he wanted to make for the club – "Without an assurance of that freedom and control I would not have stayed." 
"Major Dell Conway" was loosely-based on a true story about pilot who flew with the Flying Tigers in World War II China. The series has been called "an extremely low-budget production". The program was produced by Gen Genovese, who had served as a pilot during the war. The program aired on Saturday at 6:30 pm EST on most DuMont affiliates. In May 1951, the series went on hiatus, returning to the air on Sunday afternoons from July 1951 to March 1952. The final episode aired on March 2, 1952.
