"Allagoptera arenaria" is cultivated extensively in South America for the edible fruits which are eaten fresh or made into a drink or jam. The leaves are used to make baskets and other woven objects. The generic name of the seashore palm, "Allogoptera", comes from the Ancient Greek words ('), meaning change, and ('), meaning wing, and refers to the swirled, changing pattern of the feathery leaves. The species name, "arenaria" comes from the Latin, for "sandy" or growing in sandy sites.
Lucien Beer and Paulette Pax succeeded Lugné-Poe in 1929 and served as the theatre's directors until the beginning of World War II. Shortly after the conflict began, Hitler conquered France and the Vichy Regime under Jacques Hébertot made most theatres illegal in the occupied zone. After the Liberation of Paris in 1944, Raymond Rouleau rejoined Lucien Beer, and together they ran the theatre until 1951, when they were both replaced by Robert de Ribon.
