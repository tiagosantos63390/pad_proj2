Season five began airing on January 21, 2009 and ended on May 13, 2009 featuring seventeen episodes. A clip show recapping the first four seasons preceded the premiere. Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six and return to the island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the Oceanic Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after jumping around in time. It is also where some of the Oceanic Six are transported during the return flight to the island. The second takes place in late 2007 after Flight 316 is forced to crash land on the island.
