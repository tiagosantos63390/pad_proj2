Achievements.
May 1941 saw both The Futurist & the adjacent Scala cinema suffering bomb damage. The exact date in unclear, but a newspaper cutting from the period suggests a date no later than the 5th, and the area is known to have been very badly damaged on the 3rd. It was rebuilt and reopened in minimal time & was showing films by June that year.

Ostorhinchus neotes is a nocturnal fish that inhabits lagoons and outer reefs in relatively clear water; usually with soft corals or gorgonian fans in the Western Central Pacific: Maumere Bay (Indonesia), Palau and Madang, and in waters around Papua New Guinea. This fish sometimes forms small schools or groups.
The San Saba Mission was established in April 1757 near the site of present day Menard, Texas. Three miles away, a military post, Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, was established at the same time to protect the Mission. The purpose of the Mission was to convert and pacify the Lipan Apache and extend Spanish influence into the Great Plains. The Spanish also wished to check the increase in French influence among the Indians on their northern frontier.
