Another boxset, "Blur 21 Vinyl Edition", was released at the same time, featuring the band's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl, each of the LPs repackaged as a double album except for "Leisure", a single album. The vinyl edition does not, however, include any previously unreleased material. As above, the "Blur 21" CD/DVD/7" single pack contains many previously unreleased recordings, including the long-awaited releases of previously known about songs like "Pap Pop", "Beached Whale" and "Sir Elton John's Cock". Yet some previously released songs by the band have not been listed as featuring on the box set, such as "Colours", a "Think Tank" outtake released as a fan club single in 2003. Likewise, some unreleased songs are not featured on the box set, like "Death Metal", a jam session from the "13" sessions in 1998, and "For Old Time's Sake", recorded in 1993 for "The Sunday Sunday Popular Community Song CD", but left off the EP, due to it possibly being deleted or lost. Additionally, no material from the band's 1998 live recording and remix album "Bustin' + Dronin'" appears on the box set. "Rarities 2", one of the bonus albums in the box set, features an early mix of "Under the Westway" with some differences between it and the 2012 single version.
