Murray returned to Ipswich at the end of the campaign having helped Swindon win the League Two title. "I reckon this is my first season as a regular in the Football League and I am in a team that has won promotion," he said. "I have learnt that you have to be professional in your preparation, especially if you have a game on Saturday and then Tuesday. You have to recover well and I have learnt how to do that too." He made his first appearance for Ipswich in nearly 16 months at the start of the 2012–13 season against Blackpool in August. Murray scored four more goals, in eight appearances, for the club's reserve team before joining Plymouth Argyle on loan in January for the rest of the campaign. "I'm very pleased to get Ronan in. He comes very highly recommended," said Argyle manager John Sheridan. "He's a good intelligent footballer who scores goals and he did well when he went to Swindon last year in a promotion-winning side." Murray scored one goal in 13 appearances for the club, a "close-range finish" against Barnet in March. At the end of the season, Murray was released by Ipswich when his contract expired. In five years with the club he scored once in 14 matches.

Gomez tried to convince Selena that Saldívar was "bad news", but Saldívar claimed that he was exaggerating. A few weeks later, Saldívar asked employees to help pay for a gift for Selena. Philip Randolph (who helped design the gift, a diamond-encrusted-egg ring) noted that Saldívar did not want Selena to know that she had bought anything, let alone its cost.

On approach to the arena, it is easy to see that it is the only one of its kind in the world. The flowing natural curves of the site are translated into the building’s harmonious exterior, and the soft flowing lines of glass and shining metal rise and fall as they spin and rotate around the building. Inspired by the legendary five colorful clouds that delivered the immortals on rams to save the city from famine, the design’s overall effect is both soothing and ephemeral. The building’s exterior is iconic and instantly recognizable as Guangzhou’s unique and beautiful home for sport and entertainment.
