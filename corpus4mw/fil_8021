Wanton was a merchant, and like his father was a Quaker, and the Friends' records state that "for many years he was a valuable public friend." He first entered public service in 1706 as a deputy from Newport serving for several years in that capacity, and also as the Speaker of the House of Deputies. He was called Colonel John Wanton in 1706 when he went after French privateers with John Dublin, who was wounded in the action. Between 1721 and 1734 Wanton was the Deputy Governor for the colony, and following the death of his brother, William Wanton, he became governor in 1734, serving continuously until his own death in 1740. He was buried in the Coddington Cemetery in Newport.

Shri Ram is sitting in Padmasan (Lotus position), with only left leg crossed on to the right thigh though (both legs are not crossed unlike in the usual Padmasan). Every day after worship sandalwood’s teeka is applied on Lord Ram’s left’s thumb. It is believed when visiting the Raja Ram Darbaar if worshippers look at the left foots thumb then their wish gets fulfilled. Spotting the left foots thumb on Lord Ram’s idol is not easy, one should not look down since the left leg is folded, instead one should look close to Lord Ram’s right hand. The temple priest can also help in spotting the thumb.

In October 2009 the plant's third 10-yearly inspection on reactor 1 began, in advance of a decision on whether the plant can continue to operate for a further decade. A full decision is expected in 2011, but permission to restart reactor 1 in the interim has been given. The second reactor is due to be shut down for inspection from mid April 2011. The local Information and Oversight Commission has asked GSIEN to conduct a parallel independent inspection alongside the official inspection by the Nuclear Safety Authority.
