Hikaru and Shima, after only a kiss, leave the empty classroom so that Shima can go take care of the festival. However, Hikaru is worried about Shima and chases after him, catching him right before he falls down some stairs, and then catches Shima again when he almost falls back off the stairs, hugging him close in full view of both Nagisa, Mami, and many students.
