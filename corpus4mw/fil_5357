In March 2009, Photonix Technologies introduced its FLASHpistol optical leak detection gun. Its patent pending design introduced a new generation of product to the fiber industry, the IRFL or infra-red fault locator. It is similar to VFL or visible fault locator devices commonly used in the industry except it uniquely addresses the needs of installers and long haul service technicians because of its high sensitivity and form. The FLASHpistol(tm) replaces the now obsolete FLASHdetector(tm) which was first sold in 1996 and under U.S. Navy contract since 1997.
