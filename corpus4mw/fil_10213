As interest was recently rekindled in The Village Subway, many former artists that performed at one of the three nightclubs beneath Cameron Village shared their experiences. Dave Adams, a musician who used to play in many of the underground venues, describes how often artists became famous after their performances at The Village Subway more than thirty years ago.
