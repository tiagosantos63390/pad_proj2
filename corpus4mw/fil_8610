With their attacks on private property, belief systems, and governments pirates became outcasts to the realm of the unknown and dangerous. This realm, the sea as Rediker suggests, aided in the view of the pirate as a danger, a threat of invasion, and uncontrollable entity; just as the sea was to those who both knew the sea and had only heard tales. It was the sea that was separated from authority, and thus was the pirate who could attack those who entered the oceans.
The Marabou is a mid-wing, pod-and-boom style, tandem two seat aircraft with a pusher configuration single engine and a T-tail. The wings are trapezoidal and with 6Â° of dihedral outboard of a brief, constant chord centre section, terminating in winglets. They carry rod actuated ailerons and electrically powered Fowler flaps. The fin and unbalanced, tab assisted rudder are swept and the tapered tailplane carries a single piece tapered elevator. All manual controls are integrated in the UAV's own control drives. The outer wing panels and horizontal tail are metal structures; the wing centre section and the vertical tail are composite.
