Gossett's Broadway theatre credits include "A Raisin in the Sun" (1959). Gossett stepped into the world of cinema in the Sidney Poitier vehicle "A Raisin in the Sun" in 1961.
Husky Stadium has gone through four remodels (two major, two minor) to expand the seating capacity. Just three years after its construction, the stadium was the site of President Warren Harding's final address before his unexpected death. In 1936, 10,000 seats were added around the rim. In 1950, an upper deck of 15,000 covered seats was added to the south side - the new structure covered a portion of the lower seats.
Non-cardiac conditions.
Composition.
Storm surge caused minor coastal flooding, especially on Galveston Island. Dean dropped mostly light rainfall across Texas, though some areas received more than . Precipitation from the storm caused moderate localized damage. The resulting floods caused the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County and flooded 38 houses in the southeastern portions of Texas. Two tornadoes were also reported in the state, but neither caused significant damage. In Oklahoma, heavy rainfall flooded more than 40 houses and left about 24 cars stranded. At least three highways suffered significant flooding, while other minor roads were closed for several days. Outside of Oklahoma and Texas, the remnants of the storm dropped rainfall in 10 others states, though minimal damage occurred. Despite the flooding, property damage estimates were only $500,000 (1995 USD) and only one fatality occurred.
The parent unit of Team Yankee is the First Battalion, 4th Armor. Currently it is part of Task Force 3-78 Mechanized Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds. TF 3-78 is formed from the First Battalion, 78th Infantry. The brigade commander is Colonel Brunn.
Reception.
Youth.
The prize was established in 1948 by Paul Mellon, and was funded by a US$10,000 grant from the Bollingen Foundation to the Library of Congress. Both the prize and the foundation are named after the village of Bollingen, Switzerland, where Carl Jung had a country retreat, the Bollingen Tower. The inaugural prize, chosen by a jury of Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress, was awarded to Ezra Pound for his collection of poems "The Pisan Cantos".

The nerves within the "corticospinal tract" are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle. The nerves within the "corticobulbar" tract are involved in movement in muscles of the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain. 
Sahl, who is Jewish, received the Fifth Annual Alan King Award in American Jewish Humor (2003) from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.

Voltage-to-Frequency converters are voltage-controlled oscillators, with a highly linear relation between applied voltage and frequency. They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a digital signal for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. VCOs may have sine and/or square wave outputs. Function generators are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, square, and triangle waves. Monolithic function generators are voltage-controlled. Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in phase-locked loops for radio receivers. Phase noise is the most important specification for them. Low-frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, sweep range, linearity, and distortion are often most important specs. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, DCOs, due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. From the 1990s on, pure software is the primary sound-generating method, but VCOs have become popular again often thanks to their imperfections.

After your Highnesses ended the war of the Moors who reigned in Europe, and finished the war of the great city of Granada, where this present year 1492 on the 2nd January I saw the royal banners of Your Highnesses planted by force of arms on the towers of the Alhambra.
The greater honeyguide also catches some flying insects, especially swarming termites. It sometimes follows mammals or birds to catch the insects they flush, and joins mixed-species flocks in ones and twos. It has been known to eat the eggs of small birds.
, there were 77 students in Faido who came from another municipality, while 113 residents attended schools outside the municipality.
The appointment of Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) was carried out in a variety of ways too. In most cases men were selected who had previously held non commissioned rank in any of the armed forces or the USC. In at least one case (2 UDR) they were chosen by the men themselves. In some battalions men were appointed as lance corporals (l/cpl) on a duty by duty basis to assess their worth. In the Newry (C) company of 3 UDR many of the recruits had formerly been soldiers in the local territorial company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, including the company commander. It was a simple matter to appoint men who had previously been his NCOs and he supplemented these with former sergeants from the USC. The filling of senior NCO posts in this manner did have a drawback in that many men of comparatively young ages who had considerable years of service before retirement or promotion created a "promotion block".
Willis married Cilla Black on 25 January 1969 at Marylebone Register Office. They had three sons together; Robert, who is now her manager (born in 1970), Ben (born in 1974), and Jack (born in 1980). Their daughter Ellen (born in 1975), lived for only 2 hours. Like his wife, Willis was a keen supporter of the Conservative Party.
Sayyids in Kerala.
At first Kanık mostly was found peculiar, he was criticized harshly, and heaped upon much opprobrium because of the innovations he introduced to poetry. Although Orhan Veli's tradition-transgressing works were first received with bemusement and dismay, and were subject to derision and contempt later, they have always aroused interest. This interest however, eventually led to an increase in understanding of, and affection and admiration for the poet. Sait Faik Abasıyanık called attention to this aspect of Orhan Veli's public standing identifying him as "a poet who was much scrutinized, at times mocked, at times embraced, then again rejected, to be once again acclaimed; who achieved both great fame and notoriety in his time".

The set.
The religious foundations of the TV series are Ryukyan and Mesoamerican. Beyond Ryukyuan beliefs and Confucianism the TV series has few prominent references to traditional Eastern religion. Yakumo is shown in a kimono performing a Shinto New Year ritual, but no other religious worship is shown. The characters celebrate a secular Christmas, and distinguish between practice and belief. Kunugi visits a Christian cemetery, and important scenes in the last two episodes are set in and around a church. The show thus reflects the variations of Japanese religious practice.
Apprentice system.
, there were 38 workers who commuted into the municipality and 230 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net exporter of workers, with about 6.1 workers leaving the municipality for every one entering. Of the working population, 11% used public transportation to get to work, and 66.3% used a private car.
Psychogenic polydipsia is an excessive water intake seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, and/or the developmentally disabled. It should be taken very seriously, as the amount of water ingested exceeds the amount that can be excreted by the kidneys, and can on rare occasions be life-threatening as the body's serum sodium level is diluted to an extent that seizures and cardiac arrest can occur.

Legacy.
Missing in action (MIA) is a casualty classification assigned to armed services personnel and other combatants who are reported missing during wartime. They may have been killed, wounded, become a prisoner of war, or deserted. If deceased, neither their remains nor grave has been positively identified. Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare.
Signature.
In the Civil Air Patrol, there are 52 wings (each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico). Each wing supervises the individual groups and squadrons, which are the basic operational unit of the organization. Some wings, for example Delaware Wing have only one group due to the small size of the wing.

In April 2007, Mattel teamed up with the Sugababes to create a new themed Barbie collection, which was released in May 2007. The Sugababes also launched their own shoe collection in association with the German shoe retailer "Deichmann", available from February 2008 in sixteen countries including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, and the UK. The members chose the range of items in the Star collection themselves. The Sugababes had also told reporters that they hope to branch out into other areas such as a makeup line. In September 2010, the Sugababes released their own fragrances, named Tempt, Tease and Touch.
