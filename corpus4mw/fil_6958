Following the brigade's relief in July, the battalion did not see combat again before the war came to an end. After this the demobilisation process began and the battalion's numbers slowly decreased. In December 1945, the battalion returned to Australia, arriving in Brisbane and moving to Chermside where on 30 March 1946 the battalion was disbanded. During the battalion's active service in New Guinea and Bougainville it lost 58 men killed in action or died of other causes, and 134 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, eight MCs, one DCM, 14 MMs, 24 MIDs and two EDs.

stellar pulsations are only weakly nonlinear in the sense that one can limit oneself to low powers of the pulsation amplitudes to describe them. These two properties are very general and occur for oscillatory systems in many other fields such as population dynamics, oceanography, plasma physics, etc.
