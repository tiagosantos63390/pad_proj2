Sir Donald Maclean, KBE (9 January 1864 – 15 June 1932), was a British Liberal politician. He was Leader of the Opposition between 1918 and 1920 and served in Ramsay MacDonald's National Government as President of the Board of Education between 1931 and his death in June of the following year.
Yamauchi also wanted the machine to be the least expensive available of its kind, in his belief that people "do not play with the game machine itself. They play with the software, and they are forced to purchase a game machine in order to use the software. Therefore the price of the machine should be as cheap as possible." Nintendo hence priced the GameCube significantly less expensively than its rivals in the market, although the console’s games were priced identically to those designed for the competing systems.
The town was often called as Mikawa-Ichinomiya to avoid confusion with the much larger city of Ichinomiya in former Owari Province.

The promenade deck is a deck found on several types of passenger ships and riverboats. It usually extends from bow to stern, on both sides, and includes areas open to the outside, resulting in a continuous outside walkway suitable for "promenading", (i.e., walking) thus the name. The term is thought to be derived from the Swedish word "promenaddäck".

Upon his release, Lenin went off to Europe and settled in Munich where Krupskaya later met up with him upon her release (1901). After she had arrived the couple moved to London.
In constant-flow regulators the first stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows even when it is not needed.

According to Chinese pilgrim Fahien, who traveled India in the seventh century AD, there were many Vihars of Buddhism in India. In the Jalandhar District, there were as many as 50 Vihars of Buddhism. Hinduism was the main religion in the region. The Jatts of this area worshiped Shiva, in very large numbers, until their conversion to Sikhism in very large numbers, during the time of the fifth through seventh Sikh Guru and the ninth Sikh Guru. Some Jatts of Jalandhar worshiped Sakhi Sarwar, a mystical saint, but they to had to abandon this. The Mughal Emperor Akbar made Jalandhar Doab, a new Province of Punjab region, naming it Jalandhar Doab Sarkar. The Muslim Jatts of Jalandhar District, Tehsil Nawanshahr claim descendant from, Mehr Mithar, a Hindu Jatt, who converted to Islam, during the reign of Akbar. Only a small number had accepted Islam. Some Jatt clans of Jalandhar District that converted to Islam were members of Goraya, Kang, Sandhu, Sidhu, Atwal clans.
The women of Johnson's circle were not fond of Lennox. Hester Thrale, Elizabeth Carter, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu all faulted her, either for her housekeeping, her unpleasant personality, or her temper. They regarded her specifically as unladylike and incendiary.

Longleaf Pine forests are rich in biodiversity. They are well-documented for their high levels of plant diversity, in groups including sedges, grasses, carnivorous plants and orchids. These forests also provide habitat for gopher tortoises, which, as keystone species, dig burrows that provide habitat for hundreds of other species of animals. The Red-cockaded Woodpecker is dependent on mature pine forests and is now endangered as a result of this decline. Longleaf Pines seeds are large and nutritious, forming a significant food source for birds (notably the Brown-headed Nuthatch) and other wildlife. There are 9 salamander species and 26 frog species that are characteristic of pine savannas, along with 56 species of reptiles, 13 of which could be considered specialists on this habitat.
More abstractly, a conservative vector field is an exact 1-form. That is, it is a 1-form equal to the exterior derivative of some 0-form (scalar field) formula_36. An irrotational vector field is a closed 1-form. Since "d"2 = 0, any exact form is closed, so any conservative vector field is irrotational. The domain is simply connected if and only if its first homology group is 0, which is equivalent to its first cohomology group being 0. The first de Rham cohomology group formula_37 is 0 if and only if all closed 1-forms are exact.

An intercolonial rail system in the British North American colonies was never far from the minds of government and civic leaders and in an 1851 speech at a Mason's Hall in Halifax, local editor of the "Novascotian", Joseph Howe spoke these words:
After the problems with VHF digital signals emerged, WHYY was permitted to increase its transmitting power upon the transition. However, the problems with digital broadcasts in the VHF spectrum remain the same at the increased power level and still prevent many people in the Philadelphia area from being able to view the high-band VHF signal of WHYY – especially when also attempting to view ABC owned-and-operated station WPVI on channel 6, which operates in the low-band VHF spectrum, and requires a different VHF antenna configuration.
