The Flag Group rejected the mysticism of the Political Soldiers and the ONF's technique of establishing contacts with non-white groups such as Black Power and Islamic fundamentalism activists. Despite these differences with the ONF the Flag Group was not a direct copy of the earlier NF as it was also influenced by 'left-wing' economics ideals of Strasserism, albeit whilst emphasising anti-immigration and anti-Semitism alongside this. As time went on and Brons was sidelined in favour of Wingfield and Anderson the Flag Group began to look more towards the populism of the "Front National", which was enjoying comparative success in France at the time, resulting in a return to more basic racist sentiments and less emphasis on economics as opposed to Strasserism. Amongst their more crudely racialist polices the Flag Group stressed the importance of having large families and included ideas about the white race being bred out of existence in their election literature. Steve Brady, formerly a leading figure in the National Party, championed this idea within the Flag Group although his other favoured idea, his opposition to Christianity in particular and religion in general and his desire to see a purely secular basis for Flag Group nationalism, was not taken up. Wingfield's strategy for growth included recruiting new members at football grounds, a tactic that initially paid dividends.

In July 2012, it was revealed in "NME" magazine that Wolstenholme wrote and sang two songs on the album The 2nd Law, 'Liquid State' and 'Save Me'. Both songs were written shortly after quitting alcohol. “‘"Liquid State"’ was written about the person you become when you’re intoxicated and how the two of them are having this fight inside of you and it tears you apart. ‘"Save Me"’ was about having the family, the wife and kids who, despite all the crap I’ve put them through, at the end of it you realise they’re still there and they’re the ones who pulled you through.” He also added that "'Save Me' is a sort of a love song and I think it's the more positive among the two, it's about having a difficult time and having a person in your life who can pull you through – my wife, in my case. I guess it's all about searching stability, finding it through the person you love."
