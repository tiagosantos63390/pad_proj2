In spite of having several independent confirmations that Scotty's mining scheme had no substance to it, Johnson persisted in his belief that Scotty really had found gold in Death Valley. Beginning in 1909, Johnson made many trips out to Death Valley to visit Scotty in the hopes of finally being shown the gold mine he had been promised. Although it is almost certain that Johnson realized after a few years that the gold mine did not exist after all, he continued his trips to visit Scotty, as he had learned to enjoy Death Valley as well as Scotty's company.
Attack precipitants are usually physical in nature, such as defecation, eating, or taking medicine. Some less common precipitants are micturition, coitus, and painful stimuli. There are also non-physical precipitants, such as the thought or sight of food. In general attacks tend to occur in the precipitated area, though this is not always the case. While some individuals have described a build-up to attacks, in general they tend to be abrupt. The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours.
The species was first described by Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff in 1933, as "Mexicostylus squamatus". "M. squamatus" was the only species in the genus Mexicostylus, but that genus was later synonymised with the genus "Trichorhina". Since that genus already contained a species "T. squamata", a new name had to be provided, and so the species became "Trichorhina mulaiki".
