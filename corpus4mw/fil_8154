There was a struggle from the ninth to the eleventh century to free the Church of Brittany from the Metropolitan of Tours. From a comparison made by Duchesne between the "Life of St. Conwoion", the "Indiculus de episcoporum Britonum depositione", and an almost completely restored letter of Pope Leo IV, it would appear that shortly before 850, Nominoe wished to be anointed king, but found opposition among the prelates of Brittany; he sought to get rid of these prelates by charging them with simony. Their only fault was perhaps that they demanded eulogia from their priests when the latter came to synods. After listening to a deputation of Breton bishops and to St. Conwoion, founder of the Abbey of St-Sauveur at Redon, who had been sent to Rome by Nominoe, Leo IV declared that the charge of simony must be adjudicated by a competent tribunal of twelve bishops, and must be attested by seventy-two witnesses, thereby disputing Nominoe's claimed right to depose bishops. But in any event, Nominoe proceeded to depose the four bishops of Vannes, Aleth, Quimper, and St. Pol de Léon, and made seven dioceses out of their four. One of the new dioceses had its seat in the abbey of Dol and became straightway an archdiocese. The remaining two were in the monasteries of St. Brieuc and Pabu-Tutual (Tréguier).
