In January 2011, it was announced that Hibbert will attempt to break the speed record for crossing the Greenland icecap. The current Norwegian-held record stands at 8 days 9 hours. In order to break the record Hibbert stated he and his team-mate plan to ski in excess of and up to 15 hours per day. Despite the team being positioned on the Greenlandic coast on schedule, the planned attempt in April 2011 ended before it began as low-pressure and low cloud in the Arctic kept them stranded in Tasiilaq, Greenland for more than a week. On his website Hibbert announced plans to return in the summer of 2011. The second attempt on the speed record did take place from 12 August and finished shy of the record in less than twelve days. Heavily crevassed and turbulent glacial ice and high winds on the plateau contributed to delays which made the record impossible. The pair returned to London on 25 August after flying by helicopter and aircraft from their final position on the Russell Glacier.
