Robert Canning of IGN felt that this episode was "exciting pulse-pounding", being "the best episode of the season". He continued by saying that it "almost made you forget the sub-par episodes [you had to sit through to get and hoped it would be a set-up for a "powerful, more consistent Volume Three". He ended his review by giving the episode 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating he had given for the second season. Stephen Lackey of Mania gave the episode an "A" grading, though he felt it was "rushed overall" and thought the virus story was not as powerful as the explosion story in season one. Jason Hughes of TV Squad also felt that the stage was set for a good third volume, which he hoped would "get even darker and more dangerous". Sean Elliott of "If" gave the episode a "B" grading, saying it was an "anti-climactic ending to an uninspired second season". He liked Kristen Bell's character Elle, saying she was "interesting", and "worth exploring and developing". He said that his favourite part of the episode was that the "season [was finally over", and that it was "time to clean the slate and start with something better". Robin Brownfield of SyFy Portal called it a "great finale" and said that "there were lots of twists did not see coming". Sean O'Neal of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a A-.

In his new body, Chucky hunts down Andy, but wastes too much time and fails to transfer his soul to Andy.

Deputy Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland () is a person elected to preside over Sejm (Polish lower chamber of parliament) sessions when the Sejm Marshal is not presiding. Throughout the course of the Third Republic, there have always been several Deputy marshals, usually elected from some or all of the various parliamentary caucuses, rather than from the Government majority (although governing parties always have a majority in the Sejm Presidium, which is composed of the Marshal and Deputy Marshals).

Undetected in the battle smoke, the 94th Line overran a small redoubt. Then the regiment stormed the semicircular position, seizing the entire battery. At about 1:00 PM, the Prussian defenders fled through the Burgtor, followed by the victorious French. Bernadotte directed Drouet to the right to take the bridge over the Trave, while sending Rivaud to the left to take the Mühlentor's defenders in reverse. Other French troops boated across the Trave and forced the Bellevue battery to withdraw. 
Wagner died of a heart attack on July 20, 1942, less than two weeks before his 70th birthday, in Santa Barbara. His son, Les, a reporter for the original "Los Angeles Daily News" and later a war correspondent for the Office of War Information in India, took over the editing duties until his India assignment in 1944. Under Les Wagner, the magazine took on a more news-oriented approach. It took up populist causes and critiqued local media, often criticizing as fascist Hearst newspaper coverage and editorials on Constitutional issues and the civil rights of Mexican- and Japanese-Americans. In 1943, "Script" published editorials defending Charlie Chaplin, who was named as a defendant in a paternity lawsuit by Joan Barry, while Los Angeles newspapers were critical of the filmmaker. Blood tests ultimately determined that Chaplin did not father Barry's child. In 1944-45, Wagner filed dispatches for "Script" from Calcutta, India, on U.S. and British forces in the China-Burma-India Theater.

Chief Justice Hughes also wrote a separate opinion, agreeing with the other five justices that the act's labor provision was unconstitutional because it was poorly drafted and did not fall within Congress' jurisdiction to regulate interstate commerce but mainly sided with Cardozo's opinion and noted that the act's labor and marketing provisions were not dependent on one another. On April 12, 1937 however, Hughes, who wrote the majority opinion, would find the pro-labor Wagner Act constitutional in five separate cases and noted that it was skillfully drafted and specified interstate commerce regulations.

1893 Boston Beaneaters season
The court found that its reasoning for the "one year rule" was well illustrated by the facts of the case before it. If the taxpayers in this situation were forced to deduct their rental payments on a prorated basis, the simplicity of the cash basis method of accounting was sacrificed for an inconsequential change in the timing of deductions. Under the prorated system the taxpayers could only deduct 1/12 of their rental payment in 1973. But in 1974, and every year until 1992, the taxpayers would be able to deduct both 1/12 of the current payment (for the month of December) and 11/12 for the preceding year's payment that covered the rental period in the current tax year (January–November); thus the taxpayers would be deducting 12/12 of rental payment—an entire year's worth of payments. So there was only a difference between the prorated deduction system and the "one-year rule" for the first and last year of the lease term.
Interestingly, objects and products influence the PQ and stimulate playfulness. There is at least the implication of a feedback loop wherein people who play with objects that have a high play value are more likely to have a high PQ.

However, it was merely in the cover, as these characters were considered to be worlds apart as the stories from Superman were filled with superpowers and Sci-Fi and Batman dealt with crime and mysteries in situations similar to the real world. <br>
