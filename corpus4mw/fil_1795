Meketaten’s approximate year of birth is in or before year 4 of Akhenaten. Meketaten is first depicted on the walls of the "Hut-benben" temple dedicated to her mother Nefertiti in Thebes. Meketaten appears behind her older sister Meritaten in some of the later inscriptions, thought to date to year 4 or later. Further arguments to suggest Meketaten was born in or before year 4 come from the fact that her figure was added to one of the boundary stela recording events in year 4 and carved in year 5.

In the theory of crystal growth, Cahn concluded that the distinguishing feature is the ability of the surface to reach an equilibrium state in the presence of a thermodynamic driving force (typically in the form of the degree of undercooling). He also concluded that for every surface or interface in a crystalline medium, there exists a critical driving force, which, if exceeded, will enable the surface or interface to advance normal to itself, and, if not exceeded, will require the lateral growth mechanism.
