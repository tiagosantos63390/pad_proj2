Blackhall Road is a road running between Keble Road to the north and Museum Road to the south in central Oxford, England, dating from the late 19th century. It is named after Black Hall, dating from at least 1519, fronting onto St Giles', and now part of St John's College. Houses in the road were leased by St John's College between 1865–75.

The Koelreuteria bipinnata have little to no pests or disease threatening them. The bark of the tree might get affected from a canker that hits some of its areas. Also, coral pink bodies may develop on the diseased bark that will require pulling off the infected branches to keep the tree in good health.

Meneage gives its name to the Meneage Formation, which underlies most of the area. It forms part of the Devonian Gramscatho Group, the sedimentary sequence that lies structurally beneath the Lizard complex and is exposed along its northern boundary. The Meneage Formation is an olistostrome, of mudstone containing clasts of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, which reaches up to in thickness. The sedimentary clasts include blocks of Ordovician quartzite that reach up to in length. In the upper part, some of the volcanic rocks appear to be in place (not as clasts) and are dated as Upper Devonian from conodonts in interbedded limestones. The sequence has been affected by very low grade metamorphism in the pumpellyite–actinolite facies, with the development of the assemblage pumpellyite + actinolite + chlorite + sericite + albite + carbonate ± clinozoisite ± prehnite in the basic volcanics. The alteration of the plagioclase feldspars to albite in these rocks has previously been explained as a result of metasomatism at the time of formation, and the rocks have been referred to as spilites. Such early alteration is possible but most of the effects are now interpreted to be a result of regional metamorphism.
Louis Linn was born in Tokyo and grew up in Taipei where he, as a child, came in contact with martial arts in school and through family members. After his military service in the Special Forces, Linn started his own martial arts school in Taipei, and got involved in the film industry in Taiwan and Hong Kong becoming a known movie actor. After a brief career in film, he decided to abandon film to devote himself to teaching and developing O Shin Chuen.

In recent years the Keele River, the less travelled little cousin of the South Nahanni River, has become known as a world class destination for wilderness canoeing and rafting, seeing hundreds of people paddle down its lower section each summer. This is due to a perfect combination of spectacular rugged mountain scenery, excellent fishing and wildlife viewing and fun but challenging class 2+ whitewater with no portages. Swift currents, rapids and glacial cold water in a wilderness setting hundreds of kilometres from the nearest road mean that this river offers a thrill and a challenge to all who paddle it. Several outfitting and guiding companies offer guided tours down the Natla/Keele river system during all months of the summer. Trips usually depart Norman Wells by floatplane and land on the river at the Natla-Keele confluence. Trip length is usually between 10 to 14 days, however it is feasible to have a longer trip by pairing the Keele with the Natla river. (It should be noted that the Natla is a class 3-4 river, and therefore is an experts only trip).
