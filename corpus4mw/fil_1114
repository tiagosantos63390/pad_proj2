If 's' is the deleterious selection coefficient (the decrease in relative fitness), then the equilibrium frequency 'f' of an allele in mutation–selection balance is approximately formula_3 in haploids, or for the case of a dominant allele in diploids. For a recessive allele in 
Petri nets therefore can be used to model certain business processes with corresponding state and transitions or activities with in and outputs. Moreover, Petri Nets can be used to model different software systems and transitions between these systems. In this way programmers use it as a schematic coding reference.
There was anticipation that DNA testing might indicate whether there was Middle-Eastern ancestry among the Bnei Menashe.
