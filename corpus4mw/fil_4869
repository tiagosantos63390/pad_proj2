Les martyrs ("The Martyrs") is a four-act grand opera by Gaetano Donizetti set to a French libretto by Eugene Scribe. The libretto was based on one written by Salvadore Cammarano for an original Italian version known as Poliuto, which was not performed until after the composer's death. Pierre Corneille's play "Polyeucte" written in 1641–42, the story of which reflected the life of the early Christian martyr Saint Polyeuctus, is the original source for both versions.
