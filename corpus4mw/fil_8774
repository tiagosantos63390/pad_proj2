Martin has been the International Director of the World Wilderness Congress since 1983, as well as the executive editor for all its publications. The WWC has been described as the Olympics of the wilderness conservation world. Every four years in a different country, the WWC convenes a diverse convergence of leaders in international conservation, government, science, and busienss with the public to: achieve practical conservation results; strengthen constructive dialogue and positive action on important environmental issues; promote a greater understanding of wilderness; and enhance the protection of wild lands and seas. Established in South Africa in 1977, this is the world’s longest-running, international, public conservation project and environmental forum. The “WILD10” process, of which Martin was Co-Chair, took place in Europe and convened in Salamanca, Spain, in October 2013.
