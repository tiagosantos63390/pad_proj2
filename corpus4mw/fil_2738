Mr. Conductor Jr. (Michael E. Rodgers) aka C. Junior is the cousin of Mr. Conductor, who was always on holiday at the beach. He is good-natured and friendly, but was also originally clumsy and lazy, preferring to relax and go surfing rather than do honest work. Mr. Conductor urged him to travel to Shining Time Station to retrieve the last of the family's gold dust. There, Junior met Lily, and they went to Sodor to find Mr. Conductor. They did find him at the windmill, but Junior became caught on the whirling blades of it, and was flung onto the back of Diesel 10's roof. He ended up in the scrap yard, flung onto James's cab. The two were nearly sent into the smelting pit, until Junior used the last of his gold dust to transport them away. Junior then reunited with Mr. Conductor, and told him that their gold dust was now completely gone. When Lady returned to the Island, Mr. Conductor and Junior found their gold dust again. Junior, pleased and encouraged by his success in helping out, offers to take a job on Sodor, and was hired on as conductor so that Mr. Conductor could go back to Shining Time Station and resume working there.
