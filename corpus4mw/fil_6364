Videos are recorded with MPEG-4 compression and stored in 3GPP2 (.3g2) format, but it will also play movies in the standard MP4 container format. All videos must not exceed 320×240 in size, and may be up to 30 frames per second. The default time limit is 20 seconds (keeping it under 500kB, small enough to be sent by MMS), but touching the lower-right icon changes this to one hour (free-space permitting). Pictures are up to 1600×1200 or 1200×1600 ("two megapixels", or exactly 1,920,000, also known as UXGA), with the "digital zoom" simply cropping the picture rather than interpolating it, and white balance and brightness still being determined from the entire field of view rather than only what is within the zoomed area. There is no zoom when viewing pictures or videos, and no way to edit them on the phone.
Vierde was an agricultural village for centuries and, for the most part, still is today. Until the 19th century the keeping of "Heidschnucken" (moorland sheep) was the main source of income for the heath farmers. Only once the hardpan could be dealt with it was possible to cultivate crops, like grain and fruit trees, in order to generate new sources of income.
