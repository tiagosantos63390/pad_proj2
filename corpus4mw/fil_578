The scale-dependence of a quantum field theory (QFT) is characterised by the way its coupling parameters depend on the energy-scale of a given physical process. This energy dependence is described by the renormalization group, and is encoded in the beta-functions of the theory.

"Arcadia" by Tom Stoppard, the four-time Tony and Academy Award winning author of "The Coast of Utopia", "Rough Crossing" (Yale Rep, 2008), and "Shakespeare in Love", has been hailed as “the perfect blend of brains and emotion, wit and heartache” ("The New York Times"). Artistic Director James Bundy, whose Yale Rep credits include "Hamlet", "A Delicate Balance", and "A Woman of No Importance", stages this new production of “the greatest play of our age” ("The Independent").
A partially inflated monster will gradually deflate and recover after a few seconds, during which time Dig Dug can pass safely through it. The monsters normally crawl through the tunnels in the dirt but can turn into ghostly eyes and travel slowly through the dirt. The last enemy in a round will try to escape off the top left of the screen - and if he succeeds, the potential points are lost.
Early life.
