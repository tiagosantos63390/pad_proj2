Well-positioned forces in the USA, led by figures such as psychiatrists E. Fuller Torrey and Sally Satel, and some leaders of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, have lobbied against the funding of consumer/survivor groups that promote antipsychiatry views or promote social and experiential recovery rather than a biomedical model, or who protest against outpatient commitment. Torrey has said the term "psychiatric survivor" used by ex-patients to describe themselves is just political correctness and has blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, for the deaths of half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the street. His accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely unsubstantiated, however, and issues of self-determination and self-identity said to be more complex than that. Such claims have also been controverted by recent publications such as U.S.A. Today where a director of psychiatric services argues that the medical model and the way persons with mental illnesses are treated today cause people to die up to 25 years earlier on average.

He wrote for and edited a number of journals. His articles on topics ranging from psychology to politics attracted unfavorable attention from the German authorities, and in 1914 he and his wife, Marie, and their eight children fled to the United States.
The West Branch rises east of Thornton Gap, between Mount Osceola and Mount Tecumseh, two major summits of the White Mountains.

The West Branch joins the Mad River close to the center of the Waterville Valley resort.
