Arid ecosystems also often have patchy distributions of vascular plants with bare patches of soil in between. Such vegetation reduces radiation or wind speed at the soil surface which reduces evaporation, and thus creates favorable microhabitats for other species.In addition, as plants senesce and become litter, this increases carbon and nitrogen contents in the top layers of soil under plant canopies. Together, these effects create “islands of fertility” where plants are distributed.
