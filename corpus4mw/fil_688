In the Nordic countries, the puukko is an "everyday" knife that is used for everything from hunting, fishing, and garden work to opening boxes in the warehouse. Many traditional puukkos are nowadays manufactured in industrial or near-industrial scale by many companies, Marttiini and Iisakki Järvenpää Oy being the most notable. Bearing of sharp objects which could be used as weapons was banned in Finland in 1977. Since then, the puukko has lost its visibility in public places and been restricted to household work, hunting and fishing. In many industries the Mora knife which has a much cheaper construction is in use. The mora knife's handle is typically plastic, and the blade is either stainless steel or of laminated construction; harder steel which forms the edge is clad in softer steel. In Finnish, these knives also are usually referred to as puukko.

Due to budget constraints, however, the Ralliart was brought to market in February 2002 still as an individually numbered vehicle but only with a FWD platform and more standard fittings: side bolstered Mitsubishi-designed front seats; the standard Magna's steering wheel and gear levers wrapped in Momo black/red leather; the Magna VR-X Limited Edition's red-only instrument cluster dials and silver interior trims for the centre console and tunnel (but without the Verada-sourced chrome gear plate for the automatic). The sound system was a complete upgrade, being a 14-speaker Fujitsu Ten Eclipse tuner with CD player and remote control. Mechanically, the 240 km/h speed-limited Ralliart (compared to 210 km/h for the Sports/VR-X) featured Pirelli-shod 17"x7" Enkei alloy wheels, and Koni suspension dampers (but similar same spring rates and 22mm front, 18mm rear anti-roll bars as the Magna Sports/VR-X), new power steering pump to increase weight and feedback, upsized brake disks from the Mitsubishi Diamante AWD. Specifically, the 294mm front ventilated discs and 284mm rear ventilated discs feature harder material and 18mm and 26mm bigger than other Magna models, which have solid rear discs. Front twin-piston and rear single-piston calipers provided 26% and 32% more pad area, with front pads sourced from Japan and rears from Australia, with the same friction material as the VR-X. The engine was still a SOHC "6G74" 24-valve design but with a 180 kW output thanks to a more aggressive cam profile, modified head and combustion chamber (compression ratio from the Sports/VR-X's 9.0:1 to 9.4:1), remapped ECU and a modified Magna VR-X exhaust system - featuring stainless-steel extractors by HM Headers (the latter on their own contributing to a power boost of only 2-3 kW) and larger muffler in the centre pipe (to improve mid- and high-rev exhaust note). Ralliart was available with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed "tiptronic" automatic transmission both costing less than comparable V6 and V8 rivals, with a sunroof being the only option. The hardware for the automatics was effectively inherited from Sports/VR-X models, in that it featured the same "TCL" traction control unit (instead of the LSD exclusive to the manual Ralliart, from the Mitsubishi FTO GPX) but with varied shift patterns.
