Lee controlled all of the living conditions for the workers inside a highly secured compound. He controlled what the workers ate, whether or not they could leave the compound, with whom they could speak outside of the company and when they worked, hours for which they were often not compensated. If workers returned to the compound after the nightly curfew, they were abused by the guards. Complaining about the conditions resulted in punishment: lack of food, physical abuse, detainment or deportation.

The towns and cities of Downstate New York were created by the U.S. state of New York as municipalities in order to give residents more direct say over local government. Present-day Westchester, Bronx, New York, Richmond, Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties were part of York Shire from 1664-August 1673 and again from February 1674 until 1683 at which point the Province of New York was divided into counties. From August 1673 to February 1674 New York was under Dutch control and English political units were suspended, then restored under English rule. York Shire was divided into three divisions called ridings, the East, West, and North ridings. In 1683 the colony of New York eliminated shires and ridings in favor of counties, the East Riding becoming Suffolk County, West Riding the counties of Richmond and Kings, while the North Riding became the counties of Westchester (including present-day Bronx), New York, and Queens (including present-day Nassau).

This was definite notice to the assembled financial representatives of the world’s nations that the United States had abandoned the gold standard and adopted in its place a policy of dollar management designed to keep the dollar’s buying power constant. In several talks during 1933, the President reaffirmed this principle of a “managed currency”. However, some people saw danger of arbitrary changes in the gold content of the dollar and feared that the discretionary powers of the President would serve as a disturbing influence. Apparently the President was influenced by those views, hence after fixing the new gold content of the dollar on January 31, 1934, he has allowed it to remain unchanged. That is, while professing adherence to the doctrine of a dollar of stable domestic buying power, the Administration has compromised and, in effect, followed a policy of giving the dollar a fixed gold content, within certain limits, whenever it should seem to require such treatment.
Description.
"Would It Kill You?" was met with largely positive reviews, with many critics applauding the band's change in direction, and complimenting the increased use of acoustic guitar, and the decreased use of auto-tuned vocals. Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk awarded the album a grade of 95%, and called it "more substantial" than any of the band's previous releases. Furthermore, he wrote that "Forrest Kline has perhaps outdone himself"; he praised the band's lyrical and musical maturation, complimenting most highly the songs that feature Kline "belting out charming lyrics at a million miles an hour the rest of the band is keeping the blistering pace with the same intensity." Tin Sendra of AllMusic awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that it sounds more like "The Zombies or The Kinks rather than Jimmy Eat World or Weezer." Sendra complimented the album for being "the sound of a guy coming out from behind the tricks he used to hide behind and laying himself bare"; furthermore, he applauded the album for having "no Auto-Tune, no novelty songs, and very few moments that would lead you to think the band would be welcome on a Warped Tour stage." Edna Gundersen of "USA Today" commented on the band's growth, noting that they shied away from the use of "electronic filler", and instead focused on "sturdy instrumental interplay". In addition, she wrote that the record explored the "darker complexities of romance" rather than "the corny confines of high school diaries".
