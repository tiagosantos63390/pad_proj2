The Man Who Died in His Boat
Background.
On 8 September 1884, the "Altona-Kaltenkirchner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft" (Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company), which was established in the previous year, opened the line from Altona to Kaltenkirchen for passenger traffic. Freight operations commenced on 24 November 1884. The line was initially operated by the Kintzel & Lauser company, which had also built the line and owned share in the Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company. There was initially no provision for the transfer of freight to the state railways, but it was possible for freight to connect with the Hamburg tramway in Altona. Accordingly, a central buffer coupling was selected, which was also necessary at the beginning because of the sharp curves of the line. The AKE took over the management of the line in 1892.

The team announced a sponsorship deal with Ginga Scout on May 3, 2014.
Acacia ashbyae, commonly known as Ashby's Wattle, is a species of wattle that is endemic to Western Australia. The specific epithet "ashbyae" honours botanical illustrator and plant collector Alison Ashby.
