Dorian decides to go to Greece to steal a jade statue of Buddha or a Bodhisattva from China that will be exhibited in Athens to commemorate Yanis Phaerikis being appointed president of his father's shipping empire. The jade statue is part of a collection belonging to a friend of Yanis's father, the Chinese statesman, Tasanyuan. Russian KGB-agent Maya Bulgakova is sent to seduce Yanis, in order to control the Phaerikis fleet. Klaus is sent to capture Maya. In doing so he has Agent G pose as a woman, while Klaus himself poses as a George Johnson of the New York public welfare office (though at first glance the men who seems him thinks he might be FBI or CIA). Dorian comes in Maya's way and she attempts to kill him and G at Cape Sunion. Before the story is done they go past Austria as well, which Klaus refers to as "a Mecca for spies".
