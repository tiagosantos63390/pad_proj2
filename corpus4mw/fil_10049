As with all "Uroplatus" geckos, the tail is dorso-ventrally flattened. "U. sameiti" has colouration developed as camouflage, most being grayish brown to black or greenish brown with various markings meant to resemble tree bark; down to the lichens and moss found on the bark. "U. sameiti" has flaps of skin, running the length of its body, head and limbs, known as the "dermal flap", which it can lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making its outline practically invisible. Additionally, the gecko has a limited ability to alter its skin colour to match its surroundings.
