During the German occupation the village of Koriukivka was a center of Soviet partisan warfare in Chernihiv Oblast. On the night of 27 February 1943 the partisans of Oleksiy Fedorov, having learned that the children of the commanders of a Soviet partisan unit were jailed in the Koriukivka prison, attacked the local Axis garrison, which consisted mostly of Hungarians. During that raid 78 Axis soldiers were killed and eight captured. Several persons were released from the prison and some buildings were blown up. The partisans had warned the residents of Koriukivka about possible German retribution, but the next day after partisan raid the way out was blocked. Nonetheless at least one woman with three children managed to escape from Koriukivka on that day.

Mark Wayne Glasmire is an American country music singer and songwriter. Glasmire worked as a construction worker while trying to break into the country music scene, self-producing a number of CDs and EPs throughout the 1980s and '90s.

The video for "I Like You" was produced by Harold Jarboe (Bell-Jarboe Films) and shot in Nashville’s historic Hillsboro Village and features Vanderbilt University students as extras.
