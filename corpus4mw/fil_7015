The PHOSFOS consortium has developed a means for reliably splicing POF to silica fibre and produced the first gratings in the 800 nm spectral region where losses are almost 2 orders of magnitude less than at 1550 nm. These developments have allowed POF grating sensors to be used outside the laboratory for the first time.
