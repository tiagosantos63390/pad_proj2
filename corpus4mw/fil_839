Stable prices is the main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by making sure price increases meet the Government's inflation target.
The Hasse–Weil conjecture states that the Hasse–Weil zeta function should extend to a meromorphic function for all complex "s", and should satisfy a functional equation similar to that of the Riemann zeta function. For elliptic curves over the rational numbers, the Hasse–Weil conjecture follows from the modularity theorem.

While the homeland was under the rule of occupation authorities, the Service gained some new and, in comparison with de facto independent countries, different experience in diplomatic work and thus advanced the complete restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991. As mentioned above, the specific character of the Latvian foreign service activities is a real affirmation of the unique situation that the Republic of Latvia continued its existence de jure, and many countries never considered its annexation by the Soviet Union to be lawful and just. 
Two main areas of nanopore sequencing in development are solid state nanopore sequencing, and protein based nanopore sequencing. Protein nanopore sequencing utilizes membrane protein complexes ∝-Hemolysin and MspA (Mycobacterium Smegmatis Porin A), which show great promise given their ability to distinguish between individual and groups of nucleotides. Whereas, solid-state nanopore sequencing utilizes synthetic materials such as silicon nitride and aluminum oxide and it is preferred for its superior mechanical ability and thermal and chemical stability. The fabrication method is essential for this type of sequencing given that the nanopore array can contain hundreds of pores with diameters smaller than eight nanometers.

History.
The ANT-20 was designed by Andrei Tupolev, using the all-metal airframe technologies devised by German engineer Hugo Junkers during the World War I years, and constructed between July 4, 1933 and April 3, 1934. It was one of two aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maxim Gorky and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers design philosophy of corrugated sheet metal for many of the airframe's key components, especially the corrugated sheet metal skinning of the airframe. 
The church of Saint-Maxime was built from 1978 to 1980 by the "Œuvre des Chantiers du Cardinal". It is also designed by the architect Paul Henry and was dedicated to the Catholic faith on 16 November 1980 by Monseigneur Jacques Delarue.
In 2009, Titmuss was cast in the 25th anniversary production of John Godber's play "Up 'n' Under" at the newly refurbished Hull Truck Theatre, Hull. Titmuss played Hazel, the fitness instructor, starring alongside James Crossley (formerly the "Hunter" in "Gladiator") and soap actor Lewis Linford ("Lee Naylor" in "Emmerdale"). She also had a part in the BBC TV series "Hotel Babylon", playing a nun.
The style originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as southern African-American blues guitarists tried to imitate the popular ragtime piano music of the day, with the guitarist's thumb functioning as the pianist's left hand, and the other fingers functioning as the right hand. The first recorded examples were by players such as Blind Blake, Big Bill Broonzy, Memphis Minnie and Mississippi John Hurt. Some early blues players such as Blind Willie Johnson and Tampa Red added slide guitar techniques. Fingerpicking was soon taken up by country and Western artists such as Sam McGee, Ike Everly (father of The Everly Brothers), Merle Travis and "Thumbs" Carllile. Later Chet Atkins further developed the style.
This used to be accompanied by the following year classifications at King's St Alban's, although these have since been dropped in favour of the standard system.
The station is located on the opposite side of the Singapore River where Clarke Quay is actually situated. The distance between Clarke Quay and the previous station, Chinatown, is the shortest distance between two MRT stations in Singapore, a mere 360 metres. The reverse bungee ride, the Ministry of Sound nightclub and Club MoMo are located near to the station. The station occupies the site of the former Ellenborough Market, which has since been demolished. The shopping mall Riverside Point is also located near this station.
