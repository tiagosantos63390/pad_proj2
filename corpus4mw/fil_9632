He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in "The Symbolic Species" argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.

Estimating the number of Native Americans living in what is today the United States of America before the arrival of the European explorers and settlers has been the subject of much debate. While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus, estimates range from a low of 2.1 million (Ubelaker 1976) to 7 million people (Russell Thornton) to a high of 18 million (Dobyns 1983). A low estimate of around 1 million was first posited by the anthropologist James Mooney in the 1890s, by calculating population density of each culture area based on its carrying capacity.
In 2001 Rajabi, a member of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), was seriously wounded by agents of the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran. He was captured and arrested. In 2006, a death sentence was issued after his arrest but later he was condemned to life imprisonment. According to reports by the Iranian Liberty Assosciation, Rajabi was repeatedly submitted to extended periods of physical and psychological torture, both in Dize Abad and later in Tehran's Evin Prison, where he was also held in isolation. They also report that, as a means of trying to force him to abandon his opposition to the regime, the mullah's agents subjected Rajabi to mock executions, but he refused to surrender.
