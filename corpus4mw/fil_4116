The eastern sand darter, "Ammocrypta pellucida", is a species of the Percidae family. The eastern sand darter is a relatively small perch, most plentiful in the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, as well as Lakes Champlain, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario. It prefers sandy-bottomed streams and sandy shoals in the lakes. The eastern sand darter feeds on larvae of black flies and other small insects in the water. They also feed on zooplankton in small portions due to their small mouth size limiting their gape ability. Their average body size is around 1.5-2 in long and it breeds in the spring and summer in sandy-bottomed waters.
