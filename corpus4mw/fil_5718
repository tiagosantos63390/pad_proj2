Ettore was given a leading role in "Hotel Italia", one of Lucas Kazan's classic early films.

How magic is acquired in the series tends to differ radically from game to game. For example, in "Final Fantasy VI", magic spells are obtained from a "magicite" remnant of a god-like creature called an "Esper" who had died; this also allows for the ability to summon the Esper during battle when the magicite is equipped by a character. In "Final Fantasy VII", materia works similarly to "Final Fantasy VI"s magicite, but unlike in "Final Fantasy VI" where magic learned by a character is permanently at their disposal, magic in "Final Fantasy VII" is attached to the materia and not the character.
Construction of the fort began in the summer of 1765, and took a couple of years to complete because of structural complications as well as the constant threat of attack by the Creek Native Americans. It was named for the reigning queen at the time. The Fort was made mostly of granite quarried from across the Savannah River. The Fort measured approximately 170 foot squared with bastions at every corner and a wall height of between 10 and 20 feet. The Fort was built for defensive purposes—to protect local settlers, as opposed to being a trading fort, meant for Native American/ European trading. Almost as soon as the Fort was completed the British Royal (Federal) government abandoned the Fort by placing it under the care and authority of the South Carolina government. During that time (1768) several forts were closed in the area, and in many cases guns, cannon, powder, bullets and other military supplies were sent to Fort Charlotte for safe keeping.
