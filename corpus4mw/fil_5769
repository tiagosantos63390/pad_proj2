Klinger recently announced that, together with Laura Caldwell, a well-known writer and law professor at Loyola University Chicago and founder-director of the Life After Innocence project there, he will be editing an anthology tentatively titled "Anatomy of Innocence," to be published by Liveright/W. W. Norton in 2016. The anthology will tell the stories of exonerees—individuals wrongfully incarcerated for crimes they did not commit—as told to major thriller writers. All profits will be donated to the Life After Innocence project.

The show was produced by William Bowers and created by James M. Miller; Cooper directed at least one episode himself. ABC initially scheduled the show on Friday nights against three highly popular shows, NBC's "Sanford and Son" and "Chico and the Man" and CBS' "M*A*S*H;" it moved to Monday nights starting on October 27, 1975. The ratings were so poor that the network cancelled "Mobile One" after only 11 episodes.
