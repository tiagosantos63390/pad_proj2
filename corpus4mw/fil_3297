In 1984, after rising to the rank of full professor, Phelps was appointed chair of the university's ophthalmology department, widely recognized as one of the foremost eye clinics in the country.

He died eighteen months later at the age of 47, survived by his wife Margaret Dorsey Phelps, whom he married in 1964, his four children, his parents, and his brothers.
As a result of the increased highway width, the project required the removal of 94Â trees along Broad Street, a development the city had tried to avoid in 1951. This time, however, the Norwich city council approved the project even though the tree removal plans were opposed by hundreds of city residents. In supporting the project, the city noted that maintenance of Broad Street would be funded by the state after the project was finished due to the street's status as an arterial highway. Additionally, the council believed that the rebuilding of Norwich's arterial highways would stimulate business within the city. Construction on the $700,000 project (equivalent to $ in ) began in January 1959 and continued through at least 1961, when the new bridge carrying East Main Street over the Chenango River was completed.
After her interest in acting had waned, O'Neill quit acting in 1994 after getting scripts that required nudity. She met old childhood friend, Roy Johns, owner of a few circus acts. As she watched his work, she became interested in how active the girls in his performances were. She became involved with his acts and is now part of Johns' crew.
