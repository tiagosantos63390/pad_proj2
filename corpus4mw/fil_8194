28th TENNESSEE INFANTRY REGIMENT
Effective giving is the practice of making charitable contributions with the intention of maximizing social good.
Kerr and McPhilemy met in April 1996 at the Waterfoot Hotel in Kerr's native Derry, where Kerr admitted his membership of the Committee, although a follow-up meeting was abandoned after Kerr stated that a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) spy was present in the bar. Kerr and his wife then spent a weekend with McPhilemy in Maidstone in August 1996. Kerr told McPhilemy that he had been a paid informer for British Military Intelligence for a number of years and that they had supplied a number of the names to be killed, with Kerr presenting them to the Committee at the behest of his paymasters. Kerr named fifteen Catholics murdered between 1989 and 1991, all of whom he claimed had been killed on the Committee's orders. He also gave the names of around thirty supposed Committee members, all unknown to McPhilemy, and including twelve senior RUC officers. Kerr initially suggested that he was volunteering the information as he wanted out of his role as an informant but at a later date claimed to be dying of colon cancer and wanted to unburden himself before death.
He was also a finalist for the Wooden Award and a "Final Five" finalist for the Bob Cousy Award.
