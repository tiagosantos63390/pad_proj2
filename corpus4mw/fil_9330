The objective in "Zombie Gunship" is to use the AC-130's weapons systems to manually target and kill increasing waves of zombies, who are attacking humans running above-ground to the safety of a bunker. The zombies too are moving toward the bunker to overrun it. To kill zombies and protect the humans, "Zombie Gunship" makes available three upgradeable weapons: a 25mm Gatling gun, a 40mm Bofors auto-cannon, and a 105mm Howitzer cannon. Depending on the weapon, upgrading increases firing rate, speed to target, cooling rate, and damage radius. 
Heinz Günthardt and Paul McNamee won the title, defeating Bob Lutz and Stan Smith 6–7, 6–3, 6–2 in the final.
