In Clapham, Greater London in 1919, Hallward executed a set of eight small windows in St Peters church's North Aisle depicting the Beatitudes, a set of teachings by Jesus that appear in the Gospels of both Matthew and Luke. In Matthew the teachings are expressed as eight blessings in the Sermon on the Mount whilst in Luke four similar blessings appear in the Sermon on the Plain, these followed by four woes that mirror the blessings.
This year is mainly spent mixing the Net Epilog and building new parts of the setup.
