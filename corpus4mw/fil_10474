The Half-Faced Man deploys his "escape pod" -- in reality, a hot-air balloon made of human skin -- lifting the restaurant into the sky with him and the Doctor inside. The Doctor discovers that the Half-Faced Man and parts of the restaurant are from the "SS Marie Antoinette", the sister ship to the "SS Madame de Pompadour" ("The Girl in the Fireplace"). The Doctor claims that the Half-Faced Man has replaced his components so many times that he no longer exists in his original form and that he secretly wants to end his existence. He then warns him that he will either have to kill himself, or the Doctor will be forced to kill him to protect the humans. Clara and the Paternoster Gang are nearly overwhelmed by the other robots when they see them go lifeless. The Half-Faced Man is then shown to be impaled on the spire of Big Ben.
