Once Georgia State entered the CAA, the popular question of whether the university should add football was brought up again, this time leading the university to commission a feasibility study in 2006. After gauging student and alumni interest, the administration found enough support to continue onwards with the effort, leading to the hire of former Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Reeves as a consultant. This culminated in the official launch of the football program on April 17, 2008. Due to GSU's membership as a part of the CAA, membership into the football division of the conference was sought after, leading to the Panthers being invited to become a football participant for the 2012 season. Due to the addition of men's scholarships (64 for inclusion in the FCS), title IX regulations required the university to have additional women's scholarships added. This lead to the addition of sand volleyball and women's swimming and diving.
