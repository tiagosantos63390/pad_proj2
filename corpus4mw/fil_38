At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Clarus and Severus (or, less frequently, year 899 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 146 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
