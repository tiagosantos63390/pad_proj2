There is a public trustee in each state and territory of Australia and a similar national position exists under English law. The public trustee primarily performs the role of trustee of deceased's estates where no executor is appointed, or the executor declines to act (and no other person is appropriate). Some public trustees also provide a free or inexpensive service for drawing wills (receiving remuneration upon administering the estate). The public trustees also manage the estates of infants (such as in cases where they receive a damages settlement), prisoners, and others under a disability (legal or otherwise), when required. The public trustee may also act as trustee of unclaimed property in some states (Australia).

The frescoes can be seen as a response to Pietro da Cortona, who was at work in the palazzo during these years (Cantelli 1972).

As with most of Blake's poetry, there are several critical interpretations of "London". The most common interpretation, favored by critics such as Camille Paglia and E. P.
