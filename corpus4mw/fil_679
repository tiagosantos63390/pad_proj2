Each vehicle used on public roads must display a Warrant of Fitness sticker in the top right corner of its windscreen (as viewed from inside the vehicle). The sticker indicates that the vehicle passed its last WoF inspection, and shows when the next inspection is due. The sticker displays on the outside the year the WoF is due, with a hole punched through a number on the side or bottom indicating the month due (e.g. a hole through the number 4 indicates the next test is due in April). On the inside, the sticker shows the full date of when the next inspection is due, the vehicle registration number, and the issuing agent stamp.

The late 16th century saw the "studium" at Santa Maria sopra Minerva undergo transformation. Thomas Aquinas, who had been canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, was proclaimed the fifth Latin Doctor of the Church by Pius V in 1567. To honor this great doctor, in 1577 the Spanish Dominican Msgr. Juan Solano, O.P., former bishop of Cusco, Peru, generously funded the reorganization of the "studium" at the convent of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva on the model of the College of St. Gregory at Valladolid in his native Spain.|location=Rome The result of Solano's initiative, which underwent structural change shortly before Solano's death in 1580, was the College of Saint Thomas () at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas ("Angelicum"). The college occupied several existing convent structures and new construction was required. At that time the convent underwent considerable reconstruction to accommodate the college and the cloister was redesigned so that side chapels could be added to the church's northern flank. A detail from the Nolli Map of 1748 gives some idea of the disposition of buildings when the Minerva convent housed the College of St. Thomas.
