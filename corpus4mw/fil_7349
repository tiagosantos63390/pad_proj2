However, Hansson and Charisma were forced to give the album the augmented title of "Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings", at the insistence of Tolkien and his publishers Allen & Unwin. Tolkien's publishers also had a hand in determining the musical content of the album, as Hansson told music journalist Tony Tyler in the November 18, 1972 edition of the "NME": "I originally intended to use voices – perhaps a girl soprano – on the tracks but when we contacted George Allen and Unwin they put a firm 'no' to the idea.

The original 1972 Charisma release of the album sported front and back cover illustrations by Jane Furst.
