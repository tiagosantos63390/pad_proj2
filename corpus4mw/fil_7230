In the meantime, Kurt (Chris Colfer) is jealous of the time his father Burt (Mike O'Malley) is spending with Finn, now that their parents are dating, and attempts to emulate Burt's personality. He dresses in outdoorsman gear, sings John Mellencamp's "Pink Houses" during a glee club rehearsal, and attempts to have a fling with Brittany, making out with her in his bedroom and ensuring that his father is aware of his new behavior. Frustrated that Burt is still spending time alone with Finn, Kurt reverts to his former personality and sings "". Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologizes for not spending enough time with him. He reassures Kurt that he still loves him, and always will, no matter who his son chooses to be with.
Youth smoking is present in every society. Each society, however, views youth smoking in a different light. While some, such as in India, view youth smoking as the norm, other societies face a problem that is very similar to the one facing the U.S. In India, pre-professionals are 250% more likely to smoke than other students due to the use of sharing of cigarettes in the professional world and the importance of cigarettes in defining caste boundaries. The tobacco industry has targeted nWon-English speaking countries in a fashion similar to how they target youths in America. The translations of the messages that the tobacco industry's try to convey to these youths are interpreted as ambiguous. The result of this is that the youths are either sent a "forbidden fruit" message or they focus on decision-making and not the health effects of smoking. When the tobacco industry began to experience resistance to their overseas messages, Philip Morris began to use its Action Against Access program (1990) in an attempt to prevent restrictive legislation worldwide and to show self-restraint in the industry marketing of cigarettes to children.
