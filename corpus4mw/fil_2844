In September 2006 the DMTF launched the CDM Health Management Initiative to, for the first time, unify the computer industry on a single interoperable, secure, and functionally rich interface to diagnostics programs on multi-vendor computer systems. CDM is based on the Common Information Model (CIM) and Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) standards as pioneered by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). The CDM Health Management Initiative brings together the vast resources of the DMTF including: Education, Development Tools, Interoperability, Technical Work Groups, and Marketing, to fundamentally improve the efficiency of the computer industry in delivering more advanced software solutions as well as to directly decrease the cost of datacenter management. Via CDM technology, hardware suppliers will no longer need to develop unique diagnostic solutions for their various customers, IHVs will trim diagnostic development investment, independent software vendors will benefit by having a single vehicle to deliver adaptive software systems, and original equipment manufacturers will benefit by having an improved level of support from their vendors.

The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short free rear tip, and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. A high midline ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle has a crescent-shaped notch at the origin of the upper caudal fin margin. The caudal fin has a large lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are closely spaced but non-overlapping, such as that the skin shows between them; each is oval with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. The coloration is gray to bronze above, with a faint pale stripe on the flank, and white below; sometimes there is a green sheen along the gills. The tips of the fins (except for the pelvic fins) are darker; this is most obvious in young sharks. Males and females grow to at least and long respectively; this species possibly reaches in length. The maximum weight on record is .

In the south-west corner of Userkaf's mortuary complex is a small cult pyramid. This pyramid was destined to receive the Ka of the deceased pharaoh and thus might have housed a statue of Userkaf's Ka. It stood high with a base long and its slope is identical to that of the main pyramid at 53°. The position of the cult pyramid within the complex is unusual, the cult pyramid being normally located in the south-eastern corner. This difference is certainly linked with the peculiar overall north-south layout of Userkaf's complex with the south-eastern corner hosting the entrance to the mortuary temple.
