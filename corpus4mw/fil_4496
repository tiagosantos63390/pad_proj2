Stephen "Steve" Chubin, also known as "Chube" (born February 8, 1944 in New York City) is a retired American basketball player.
The first rerouting of US 220 within Cumberland occurred in 1956, when Frederick Street was reconstructed and became the northbound direction of a one-way pair in conjunction with Bedford Street. By 1964, the federal highway followed Mechanic Street north to the Frederick/Bedford pair instead of Henderson Avenue. In 1977, a viaduct was completed to carry US 220 over the railroad tracks and US 40 ALT. US 220 was moved off of surface streets in downtown Cumberland when the highway was placed on the Cumberland Thruway (now I-68) between McMullen Highway and Naves Cross Road in 1982. The highway used Naves Cross Road to reconnect with Bedford Road, which was designated MD 807 between Naves Cross Road and the Cumberland city line. In 2000, the two-lane, limited-access bypass of Bedford Road was completed northeast of Cumberland; MD 807 was extended north along the bypassed part of Bedford Road. The portion of US 220 between the southern city limit of Cumberland and I-68 was transferred from municipal maintenance to state maintenance in 2010.
