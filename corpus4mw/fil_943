The Getty is involved in a controversy regarding proper title to some of the artwork in its collection. The Museum's previous curator of antiquities, Marion True, was indicted in Italy in 2005 (along with famed dealer Robert E. Hecht) on criminal charges relating to trafficking in stolen antiquities. Similar charges have been addressed by the Greek authorities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a Geneva, Switzerland, warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market". In 2005 True was forced to tender her resignation by the Board of Trustees, which announced her "early retirement." Italy allowed the statute of limitations of the charges filed against her to expire in October 2010.

As more of Chambliss's men (and General Stuart) arrived on the scene, they were met by additional Federals near the sprawling Karle Forney farm, just south of Hanover. Nearly surrounded in the confused fighting, Stuart and a staff officer made their escape cross-country through the hedges bordering the country lane, at one point leaping their horses over a wide ditch. Hearing the unmistakable sound of distant gunfire, Judson Kilpatrick raced southward towards Hanover, with his horse dying in the town square from the severe ride. The young general began to deploy his men in and around Hanover, barricading some streets with barrels, farm wagons, dry goods boxes, and anything else that might provide cover. Shortly before noon, fighting at the Forney farm ceased as the Rebels broke off contact. Kilpatrick positioned Custer's newly arrived brigade on the farm and awaited developments.

Remy Zero's first album, self-titled, drew from these experiences and received little recognition or sales. The subsequent album "Villa Elaine" caused them to be praised as "the next big thing". "Villa Elaine" was recorded when the band was living in an apartment of the same name in Hollywood. Remy Zero's third album "The Golden Hum" was also received well. A 50 second version of the song "Save Me" from "The Golden Hum" was used as the theme song for WB/CW's "Smallville" during its ten season run. Remy Zero's music has also been on KCRW's "Morning Becomes Eclectic" radio show. Remy Zero's song "Shattered" was used in the films "Crazy/Beautiful" and "Suicide Kings". "Fair" from "Villa Elaine" was used in the films "Garden State" and "Fanboys", "Prophecy" was used in "She's All That", "The Last Kiss", "Gramarye" was used in the film "Stigmata", and "Perfect Memory" was used in the film "The Invisible" and the last episode of Smallville's first season (where the band guest starred on screen and played. They played 'Save Me' as well). Director Bill Draheim documented the making of "Save Me". Save Me from my Half- Life Drive is the result of that edited EPK footage. Remy Zero recorded a version of Art Garfunkel's song "Bright Eyes" for the 2002 album "For the Kids."

Legends from history.
Lieutenant Colonel William Lewis led these men across the frozen Maumee River and along the shore of Lake Erie to the River Raisin. His force consisted of 667 Kentuckians and about 100 local French-speaking militiamen. On January 18, 1813, Lewis charged across the frozen River Raisin to attack the British and Indian camp, which contained 63 soldiers of the Essex Militia, accompanied by a 3-pounder cannon, and about 200 Potawatomi. A brisk battle took place before the Americans forced the British and their allies to retreat. The Canadians charged the American lines several times, supported by the gunfire of the Indians. Fighting continued sporadically for several hours, with the Canadians and natives fighting log to log, after which Lewis reclaimed Frenchtown. Reynolds' brother commented later that the Essex Militia “fought most bravely, retired slowly from log to log.” The skirmish has been noted as one of a few examples when Canadian militia stood fast during the war without the backing of British regulars. 
The Assamese script (অসমীয়া লিপি "Ôxômiya Lipi") is a writing system of the Assamese language. It used to be the script of choice in the Brahmaputra valley for Sanskrit as well as other languages such as Bodo (now Devanagari), Khasi (now Roman), Mising (now Roman) etc. The current form of the script has seen continuous development from the 5th-century Umachal/Nagajari-kanikargaon rock inscriptions written in an eastern variety of the Gupta script, adopting significant traits from the Siddham Script along the way. By the 17th century three styles of Assamese script could be identified ("baminiya", "kaitheli" and "garhgaya") that converged to the standard script following typesetting required for printing. The present standard is identical to the Bengali script "except for three letters".

Newman recalls that Fox had no faith in the film and released it in neighborhood theaters only to disappear in less than two weeks. However, it was a critical and commercial success in the UK and Europe which prompted the studio to re-release it in the United States on a double bill with "The French Connection". After completing its run at the cinema box office, the film gained extended life as it became a second feature favorite in drive-in theaters across the US. A cult following began to develop, due in large part to a broadcast on network television in 1976.

Uruguay took the UFWC into Group D of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and, in a shock result, lost it to in their opening match. Later, an already-eliminated England challenged Costa Rica for the UFWC in their third group-stage game and the UFWC was mooted as a potential consolation prize in the British press, Costa Rica retained the UFWC until their quarter-final loss to the Netherlands. With the UFWC taken into the knockout stages, "unification" of the World Cup and the UFWC was guaranteed, and Germany's victory in the final secured them both. Argentina, the runner-up of the tournament, didn't have to wait long for regaining the UFWC title though, as both teams played a friendly soon after the finals, and Argentina won.

Kotzen would later be expelled from the band following the world tour, after it was discovered that he had been romantically involved with the fiance of drummer Rikki Rockett. Recollections of the album, while no doubt soured by these events, nonetheless appear to faithfully reflect the basic clash between Kotzen's style and that of the band's founding members. Kotzen would later claim that "being in Poison helped me forget I was a musician" while Rockett would lament the loss of the band's original "attitude"

Over twenty skulls have been found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, elaborate bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds what it would have been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. In fact the area's concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.

After 36 BC, he accompanied his father as they left Greece and lived his remaining years in Alexandria, Egypt in the court of Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt.

Language death can be fast, when the children are taught to avoid their parents' language for reasons such as work opportunities and social status. At other times, minority languages survive much better, for example when the speakers try to isolate themselves against a majority population. Often, especially historically, governments have tried to promote language death, not wishing to have minority languages.
