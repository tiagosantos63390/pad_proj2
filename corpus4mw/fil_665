The Triton Le, released in 2002, was a stripped-down, streamlined version of the original Triton (released in 1999). It replaced the oversize touchscreen by a more conventional, smaller, graphic LCD. The ribbon controller and floppy disk drive were omitted in the transition. A Smartmedia slot was offered instead. Other changes were the key bed (lighter and cheaper than those used in the Trinity/Triton range), and the effects section. Taking a step back from the powerful effects sections found on the Trinity/Triton series, the Le's section was downgraded from five insert FX to just one. The MOSS, a Z1-based board, can't be fitted on the Le. The sequencer and arpeggiator remained as powerful as on the original Triton, though. 
She tours regularly with pianist Gilbert Kalish. Richard Goode and Margo Garrett are also long-standing partners. She has worked with the director Peter Sellars many times, including his staging of Händel's "Theodora" at Glyndebourne, his Paris production of Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" (as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen's month-long residency at the Théâtre du Châtelet) (1996), a staging of Bach's cantata "Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut, BWV 199", presented in the 1995-96 season at New York's 92nd Street Y, and the Salzburg Festival production of Olivier Messiaen's Saint François d'Assise (1998). Ms. Upshaw has often performed as a soloist at the annual Ojai Music Festival in Ojai, CA; most recently in 2006, 2008 and 2009. In 2011, she was the Music Director of the festival, where she performed the world premiere of the Peter Sellers' staged production of George Crumb's work, "Winds of Destiny".

Little Canada (French: "le petit Canada") is a name for any of the various communities where French Canadians congregated upon emigrating to the United States, in particular New England, in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A variant of Canadian French known as New England French is still spoken in parts of New England.
The acetylated residue of α-tubulin is K40, which is catalyzed by α-tubulin acetyl-transferase (α-TAT) in human. The acetylation of K40 on α-tubulin is a hallmark of stable microtubules. The active site residues D157 and C120 of α-TAT1 are responsible for the catalysis because of the shape complementary to α-Tubulin. In addition, some unique structural features such as β4-β5 hairpin, C-terminal loop, and α1-α2 loop regions are important for specific α-Tubulin molecular recognition. The reverse reaction of the acetylation is catalyzed by histone deacetylase 6.
The CA3 of the hippocampus plays an especially important role in the encoding and retrieval of spatial memories. The CA3 is innervated by two afferent paths known as the perforant path (PPCA3) and the dentate gyrus (DG)-mediated mossy fibers (MFs). The first path is regarded as the retrieval index path while the second is concerned with encoding.
Charles Algernon Parsons invented the steam turbine in 1884, and, having foreseen its potential to power ships, he set up the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company with five associates in 1893. To develop this he had the experimental vessel "Turbinia" built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at Wallsend on Tyne in the Northeast of England.

Dry-aged beef is typically not sold by most supermarkets in the U.S. today, because it takes time and there is a significant loss of weight during the aging process. Dry-aging can take from 15 to 28 days, and typically up to a third or more of the weight is lost as moisture. This type of beef is served in higher-priced steakhouses and by select restaurants. Dry-aging can be done at home under refrigeration by three means: open air, with the presence of salt blocks, and with the use of a moisture permeable drybag to protect the meat while it is aging.

The first major update came in 1963, with the most visible change being the markers on neck: early models had dots (hence "dot neck"), later models had blocks.
Dreyer had prepared a Danish version of the film which was based on the German version with Danish subtitles and title cards. The distributor could not afford to have the title cards completed in the manner they appear in the German version, which were instead finished with a more simple style. The distributor also wanted to make the pages in the book shown in the film as plain title cards which Dreyer did not allow, saying that "the old book is not an text in the ordinary sense, but an actor. Just as much as the others."

Amtrak service to Metropark began on November 11, 1971. The new station's cost had increased to $2.6 million, shared by NJDOT and the United States Department of Transportation. It consisted of two high-level platforms and had 820 parking spaces. The location was right off of the Garden State Parkway to allow for easy access by automobile and a large business park was built next to the station to entice riders. Commuter trains continued to use a station in Iselin, New Jersey. Commuter trains began stopping at Metropark in 1972 and the nearby Iselin station was closed (and, a few years later, Colonia).
A man awakens from an apparently long sleep. His caretaker, a young woman, wants him to confirm that he was put in cryogenic sleep in June 2023. Then she reveals he's been asleep for 324 years, it is the year 2347. The woman, Sarah, brings the man, Matthew, outside to see a small farm town. He is confused as to why he wasn't brought to a city, but she claims there are no more cities, freeways or factories. Sarah takes him into what she calls the surgery area, where surgery is performed without need of anesthetic or instruments. She and two others use psychic abilities to take out the cause of the incurable disease that required him to be put into the cryogenic sleep. Matthew is overwhelmed when he sees Sarah reach into his body and pull out the cancerous tissue painlessly. Although they are no longer technologically advanced, humans have made progress in 300 years. Theirs is a world in which technology is replaced by advances in human awareness and spiritual growth, where the organic replaces the mechanical, where they live in balance and harmony with all life on the planet in what Sarah refers to as a 'biological gestalt".

Not all installations distinguish the live (phase) and neutral conductors, and reverse wired sockets are quite common, so double pole breaking RCDs and main switches are recommended. When sockets are mounted looking downwards then the connector system is rated for outdoor use in all weather. This is also the standard connector for lighting equipment (up to 16 A) used in the British film and television industry. (often as outlets from a power splitter with a higher rated 3 phase input)
