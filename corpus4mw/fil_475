"The Normal Leader" was created in September 1899 by the Zetesian society, an all-male literary organization. "The Normal Leader" was a monthly newspaper, costing ten cents a copy or fifty cents for a yearly subscription. On September 28, 1936 "The Normal Leader" became what we know today as "The Leader" on its Vol. XXXVI article No. 3 even though the school would not change its name to SUNY Fredonia until 1948. "The Leader" is produced by a team of Fredonia students, some of whom receive stipends from the Student Association. "The Leader" is printed by the "Corry Journal" in Corry, Pennsylvania and is distributed free on campus and in the surrounding community. Today, The Leader features mainly news which is pertinent to the SUNY Fredonia campus and community. This weekly publication comes out every Wednesday during the academic year and can be found around the SUNY Fredonia Campus.
