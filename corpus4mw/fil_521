He was still constantly affected by ill health when he returned to the capital Beijing later.

Sweeney said that he had been interested in game development and computer programming since he was 10 years old. Sweeney finally started making games out of his parents' basement where he lived. Epic got its start when Sweeney created "ZZT", the company's first game. As Sweeney said in interviews, "ZZT"'s success fueled the early growth of his company. The game was released as a shareware in 1991.
