Reception.

Hedwig did not remarry straight away. She returned to her home-place of Żagań where she lived at the court of her brother, Henry VI the Older.
On December 1995, the band released the CD "Strašni sud" ("Judgement Day"), which, with a punk oriented sound combined cataclysmic lyrical style, with the songs "Zanimljiva geografija" ("Interesting Geography"), "Neki drugi grad" ("Some Other City"), "Uradi sam" ("Do It Yourself"), inspired by the current political situation, "Večna lovišta" ("Eternal Hunting Ground") and "Ustani i kreni" ("Stand Up and Go"), which became hits. As bonus tracks appeared five songs from the previous releases. After the album release, guitarist Goran Majkić left the band, first serving the army and then moving to the USA where he got a master's degree at the NASA Center for Autonomous Control Engineering. With former Dead Kennedys and Butthole Surfers members, he formed the band God Dog. Igor Panić took his place in Dža ili Bu.
