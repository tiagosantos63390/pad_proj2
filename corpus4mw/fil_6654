EAAB estimates per capita usage of around 130 L/day. In Latin America, the average water use was estimated in 2005 at about 240 L/day per capita. Total consumption was about 17 m3/s, of which 85% (or 14.5 m3/s) was returned to the Bogotá River downstream. The other municipalities in the basin used about 1 m3/s, for a total of 18 m3/s for the whole basin. This amount increased to 23–25 m3/s by year 2000 and was expected to reach 27–32 m3/s by 2010.
