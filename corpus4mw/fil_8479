The white water rafting here consists of class I, II and III rapids at different parts of the river. Class I is considered easy and smooth, with occasional sand banks, and has gentle curves. The most difficult problems might arise when paddling around bridges and other obvious obstructions. Class II is considered moderate. It has medium-quick water and rapids, regular waves, and open passages between rocks. Knowledge of how to maneuver a raft is required and tour guides are recommended for beginners. Class III is moderately difficult. It has numerous high and uneven waves with rocks and whirls. The passages are clear but narrow and require experience to raft down. Visual inspection is required if rapids are not well known. The class III rapids are located at the end of river for 30 seconds. The Nantahala River is located at the end of the Nantahala National Forest. The white water rafting trip consisted of eight miles of clear water that takes about 3 to 4 hours. The tours were fully guided by professional white water rafters who are trained first aid. The river is dam-controlled river, good water flow at any time of the year. Kayaking also occurs as a recreational sport down this river. A popular form of kayaking in this region is called duckys, or an inflatable kayak to make it easier to go down the river and back up quickly. The duckys are suggested for experienced river rafters who are looking for a more high-performance trip down the river.
