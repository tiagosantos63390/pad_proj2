Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. was a 2007 case in which the US District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that copyright holders must consider fair use before issuing takedown notices for content posted on the internet. Stephanie Lenz posted on YouTube a home video of her children dancing to Prince's song "Let's Go Crazy." Universal Music Corporation (Universal) sent YouTube a takedown notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claiming that Lenz's video violated their copyright in the "Let's Go Crazy" song. Lenz claimed fair use of the copyrighted material and sued Universal for misrepresentation of a DMCA claim. In a decision rejecting a motion to dismiss the claim, the district court held that Universal must consider fair use when filing a take down notice, but noted that to prevail a plaintiff would need to show bad faith by a rights holder.
About half of the collections of the University Library of Potsdam are open access holdings shelved according to the Regensburger classification system (RVK), which is widely used in Germany. An interlibrary loan system allows registered users to request material held at other sites. There are about 430,000 lending transactions annually and 28,000 registered borrowers. An increase in efficiency is a result of the introduction of RFID (radio frequency identification). The open access holdings of each library site are equipped with transponders and the users borrow and return items quickly using self-service machines. At present, 740 seats are available for readers in the whole library system, 160 of which have workstations that enable online catalogue and/or Internet access.
