The main arteries of the village are the old Notre-Dame, Saint-Jacques, Masson, Grenier, Lacordaire, Tessier, Station, and Du Pont. The latter street derives its name from the floating bridge on Lake Croche, which connected the lower village to road St-Michel (north). With the expansion of the village, the names of new streets was a common surname: Bédard street, Veillette, Valley, Piché, Proteau Square, Cloutier Square, Marcotte road, Marchand road ... Centennial Street (rue du Centenaire) was erected during Celebration of the Sainte-Thècle Centennial in 1973-74, in parallel to the Villeneuve street. Several roads were designated according to their geographical context: Chemin de l'Anse (Cove Road), Lake Jesuit, Lake Traverse, Lake Aylwin, Lejeune Township, Lake Button... Finally, "Joseph St-Amant" road in Lejeune Township makes tribute to this businessman of Saint-Tite, who has greatly contributed to the forest industry. He owned a sawmill located on "Ruisseau Le Bourdais" street in the town of Saint-Tite.

The Scottish crossbill, "Loxia scotica", which inhabits the coniferous forests of the Highlands, is Britain's only endemic bird and, with only 300 breeding pairs, one of Europe's most threatened species. Its shape, red/green hue and habit of hanging upside down has led to comparisons with parrots. St Kilda has a unique subspecies of wren, the St Kilda wren "Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis", which has adapted to perching on the rocks and cliffs of this treeless Atlantic island, and consequently has developed larger and stronger feet than the mainland variant. It is also slightly larger, has a longer beak, a drabber though more varied colouring, and a "peculiarly sweet and soft" song. The subspecies was recognised in 1884 and was protected by a special Act of Parliament in 1904 to prevent its destruction "at the hands of ornithologists, egg-collectors, taxidermists and tourists".
