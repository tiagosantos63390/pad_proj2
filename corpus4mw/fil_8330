Model organisms have been used in the study of OSBPL9 function. A conditional knockout mouse line, called "Osbpl9tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi" was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program — a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists — at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
