Paul and Beth have sex finally, after Beth's initial reluctance. Afterwords, Beth begins to question Paul's motives for returning to Wisteria Lane when she finds out that he is letting his old cellmate move into his old house. He refuses to tell her why. The next day when Paul is out, Beth goes over to his old house and confronts his cellmate. She shows more of her disturbed and personality when she threatens to tell the police that he attempted to rape her if the guy does not comply with her wishes (to tell her what Paul's up to). Later, Beth confronts Paul about what his former cellmate told her (it is not revealed to the viewers at what the guy told Beth). Paul tries to defend himself, but finds there is no need, as Beth tells him as before that she supports her husband in all his endeavors. He calls her the "perfect wife", but it is proved she is not when it is revealed at the end that Beth's mother, to whom she is always whispering on the phone, is none other than Paul's equally demented and sworn enemy: the imprisoned Felicia Tilman.
The expedition started in late July 1959 in Montmelian, France. It followed the valley of the Arc river and then ascended towards the Col de Clapier. However, the route up to the pass had become narrowed and dangerous due to rockfall. The group retracted down into the valley and crossed the Col du Mont Cenis, another pass suggested for Hannibal's route by none less than French emperor Napoleon. After 10 days of travel, the expedition successfully "invaded" Susa in Italy.
