We then see Nicole in her black and peach bikini lying down on the sand. Her lover is filming her from above. Nicole then is seen semi nude, with her hands covering her breasts. Then she is seen playing around with her lover in the sea. They splash around and Nicole then is seen on the edge of the boat, in a blue dress. More semi nude appearances follow. But then we return to the bed, which was seen at the start. Nicole is now kneeling on top of her boyfriend, in her white bra and panties. She sings to him whilst he strokes her hips and touches the sides of her panties. She then leans down to kiss his cheek softly. He kisses her arm. The video ends with Scherzinger making one final semi nude appearance, covering her breasts with her hands. She giggles and the scene fades.

Beaufighter production proceeded more smoothly than its forebear, as might be expected when the same sub-contracting companies took part in both programmes. The RAAF had considered the type as early as February 1939 and placed an initial order in June that year, before the prototype had even flown. The same supply problems that delayed the Beaufort ended any chance of the RAAF acquiring Beaufighters for the time being, and it wasn't until the end of 1942 that plans began to be laid for Beaufighter production. The Australian Government gave the go-ahead for manufacture of 350 Beaufighters on 30 January 1943 and preparations got underway in earnest. As the supply of engines from Britain was still uncertain at that time, a Bristol-built aircraft was re-engined with Wright GR-2600 Cyclones as insurance; in the event all Australian-built Beaufighters were fitted with imported Bristol Hercules engines. The first DAP Beaufighter flew for the first time on 26 May 1944 and production and deliveries slightly overlapped those of Beauforts, with the first two dozen Beaufighters being built and delivered concurrently with the last fifty-or-so Beauforts. Orders were increased to 450 but with the end of the War the programme was terminated after 365 had been built, with another 21 partially built airframes not delivered.
Many elements of the design, such as the striking colors used for the coordinated body panels, the Space Age instrument panel, translucent passenger grab handles, and slickly serviceable storage compartment had a consumer appliance feel and appearance, "remind you of current computer peripherals such as HP ScanJet printers." Its small transparent wind screen seemed "iMac-inspired", and the use of translucent polycarbonate elsewhere hinted at Apple's style at the time. The addition of superfluous oblong slots with incongruous rubber inserts along the sides of the aluminum frame led "Rider" magazine to quip that it was "overstyled". BMW "ripped a page from the strategy book of Apple Computer Inc" with its three "youth-oriented" color choices, azure blue metallic, golden orange metallic and beluga blue.
