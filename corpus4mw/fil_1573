But Hume agrees with the Whigs about the right of resistance when govern­ments become tyrannical. Our "interest" in government consists in "the security and protection, which we enjoy in political society", and therefore disappears as soon as the authorities become intolerably oppressive. And though our "moral" obligation to allegiance might be expected to linger on stubbornly due to the influence of general rules, our familiarity with human nature and the history of tyrants will give us additional general rules marking out exceptions to the common rule. And thus public opinion ("perfectly infallible" in ques­tions of morality) is not wed to any exceptionless rule of "passive obedience", but is perfectly willing to "make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression".
The Jacobite Standard was raised above Glenfinnan by the Party, 260 years after Bonnie Prince Charlie did so in 1745.

The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit featuring an advanced navigation and fire control suite. The tandem seating placed the pilot in the rear seat, and the gunner in the front seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner facing the same direction as the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.

His real name is Toshio Eto, and he was a history professor prior to becoming a superhero. One day, Eto was struck by a beam of light sent by the New Gods of New Genesis, who were trying to create more superheroes to defend the world from Darkseid.

He led a split within the Forward Bloc in 1948, and his faction constituted a separate All India Forward Bloc (Ruikar). In December 1948, he became the president of the Hind Mazdoor Sabha trade union federation. Later his party was disbanded and he joined the Praja Socialist Party.
In 2011, the decision was made by the University to phase out the Deaf Studies Program. Though the administration recognized that the program greatly benefited the ASL students, giving them great advantage in their field, and that the program helped train ministers and missionaries to an unreached group that needed the Gospel as much as any other person, the University could no longer financially support the program. Just days before the 2010-2011 school year ended, however, it was announced that the University had received a donation that would keep the program open for many years to come and the University reversed the decision to phase out the program. The program was later phased out.

After Gibbs leaves at the end of season 3, he personally appoints Tony has team leader. As leader, he tries to emulate Gibbs' leadership style, but he did make some changes. These included calling "Campfire" discussions (an impromptu sharing of current information among his fellow agents, which his peers found annoying), and reorganizing the equipment in the field truck. When Tony is offered his own team in Rota, Spain, he turns the offer down claiming that he wanted to keep an eye on Gibbs, whose memory has still not completely returned after the blast at the end of season 3. Gibbs indicates his belief that Tony is ready for his own team, unaware of the fact that Tony has already been offered this opportunity.
