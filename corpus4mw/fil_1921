When Hourman met Rick Tyler, son and heir of the original Hourman, they fought. They would eventually make amends when Amazo, disguised as a future version of Hourman, cures Rick of the disease he had contracted thanks to his Miraclo addiction. After spending some more time with the Society, Hourman left to explore the timestream more, but not before giving Rick two gifts: an hour with his father in the Timepoint before Rex would give his life to fight Extant- using a special gauntlet, Rick could travel to and from the Timepoint to talk with his father, with time not existing for Rex while Rick was absent, but once an hour had elapsed Rex would have to leave to fight Extant-, as well as an hourglass filled with tachyons that allowed Rick the occasional 'vision' of the future that would take place in an hour's time.
