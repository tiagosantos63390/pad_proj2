This project embedded all Taglioni's technical beliefs and evolved from his dissertation written in 1948 that concerned a 250 cc 90° V4 engine: Bipantah was the most "oversquare" engine he designed (78mm bore x 52mm stroke = 994cc displacement), in order to reduce overall length and height for a better accommodation inside the frame, but in spite of this it was only 100 mm wider than a "single" Pantah. Rear cylinders were bolted almost vertically to the crankcase, with front ones were almost horizontal, this because they were tilted 20° backwards to provide room for front wheel to move during compression under braking. They were also widely finned because Taglioni preferred air cooling for thermodinamical, weight and size reasons.

Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock already was a devout patriot as a youth, as is shown by a "War Song" written in 1749 honouring the Prussian king Frederick the Great. When the king, however, did not patronize German artists and poets but declared his love for French culture, Klopstock thought that it was up to him to defend German poetry.
On October 3, Serpe launched "22 Ideas for District 22," a series of policy proposals for the District that she planned to highlight, one idea per day, on her website. Said Serpe, "These 22 ideas are a starting point for a community discussion about the needs of our district.

Svimon was married twice; he first married, in 1712, Gulkan (Guka; died 1717), daughter of Bardzim, Duke of Aragvi, and then, already a widower, Ana (fl. 1724 – 1745), daughter of Prince Paata Amilakhvari. Svimon had two sons by his first marriage—Beri (fl. 1724) and Archil—and two sons by his second marriage—Stepane (1727–1744) and Dimitri (1729–1745). Svimon's first wife and many of his household died in an outbreak of plague in 1717 and the prince built a church in Tbilisi in their honor. His son of the second marriage, Prince Dimitri married in Russia, in 1743, as her third husband, Princess Stepanida Rzhevskaya (1705–1762), former wife of Prince Aleksandr Galitzine and of Colonel Iakinf Alymov.

The commission itself was announced in August 2006 and sought to establish "the conclusive truth regarding human rights violations to have occurred prior to, immediately after the Popular Consultation on 30 August 1999" as well as "prepare recommendations that can contribute to healing wounds of the past and strengthen friendship". The timing of the commission's creation was criticized by some, as it was believed that it was created to intentionally subvert calls for an international tribunal to deal with the events surrounding the 1999 plebiscite. The commission's mandate allowed it to review documents pertaining to four other inquiries surrounding the events that predated it: "The Indonesian National Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights Violations in East Timor in 1999", "The Indonesian Ad Hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor", "The Special Panels for Serious Crimes", and "The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation".

When a new courthouse was built in 1964, county officials planned to demolish the old courthouse; however, local outcry convinced the county to temporarily save the building. The courthouse sat disused and neglected until 1967, when the Iroquois County Historical Society formed and purchased the building for a museum. The museum is the home of the county's genealogical records library and includes collections of minerals and fossils, Native American artifacts, antique dolls, and numerous other historical items. The original courtroom is now used as a theater and concert hall.
