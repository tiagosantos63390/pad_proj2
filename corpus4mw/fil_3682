Lee Long was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 2001 to represent the seat of Tablelands. Tablelands had before 1998 been a safe seat for the National Party, but fell at the 1998 election to Shaun Nelson of the One Nation Party. Lee Long was a campaign worker for Nelson during this election. Nelson subsequently left the party in 1999 amid internal tensions, and recontested the seat at the 2001 election as an independent, losing out to Lee Long. By this point, support for the One Nation party had sharply declined from the party's high point, and Lee Long was one of only three One Nation MPs in the Legislative Assembly.
Powderfinger announced the "Across the Great Divide" tour on 12 June 2007. The band were accompanied on the nationwide concert tour by Australian rock group Silverchair.

According to Fanning, "the idea is to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation Indigenous Australians."
