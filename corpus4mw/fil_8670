Grinderman was formed by vocalist and guitarist Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey and drummer Jim Sclavunos, as a side project to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, in 2006. The band released its debut eponymous album, "Grinderman", in 2007 on Mute Records. The album charted in ten countries upon its release and reached number 1 on the US "Billboard" Heatseekers Albums. Following a short break to focus on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds fourteenth studio album, "Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!" (2008), the band released its second studio album, "Grinderman 2" in 2010. A major critical success, the album resulted in five singles and extensive touring over a two-year-period. Grinderman disbanded in December 2011 following a performance at the Meredith Music Festival in Victoria, Australia to focus on The Bad Seeds upcoming material. However, Jim Sclavunos has since said: "I can't predict what the future of Grinderman is â€“ if there is a future."
