History.
Caldwell High School's cross country team had one of the most dominant runs by any Ohio High School Athletic Association team, winning small-school state championships every year from 1985 to 1992 and the National Championship in 1986. During several of these years, they were also arguably the best team in any division, since they beat the best large-school state champions from those years in regular-season races. Mah Dugan Hill, who was also on a 1973 state title team at Caldwell, coached those teams, and in still coaching at CHS continues to produce many solid state-qualifying teams. The Ohio Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches elected him to their Hall of Fame in 1996 and awarded him the Ed Barker award in 2006 for these outstanding accomplishments.
