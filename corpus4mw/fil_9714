Senior career.
Charles Henry Brownell, who purchased the present house from Rawlings in 1867, is better attested than he. Born and raised in Chautauqua County, New York, Brownell settled in Washington Court House in 1866 and at once became interested in the buying and selling of eggs and poultry. Before long, he and his brother began a partnership that continued until the brother's death in 1892; from 1872 until 1882, they were engaged in the retail grocery business, but their poultry business grew so fast that they chose to specialize in it while leaving the grocery business. By 1914, the business had grown to be one of the largest of its kind in a wide region of the state.
