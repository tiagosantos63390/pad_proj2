Tao Fong Shan Christian Centre (Chinese: 道風山基督教叢林) is situated at Tao Fong Shan, Sha Tin, in Hong Kong. The Centre was founded in 1930 by the Norwegian missionary Karl Ludvig Reichelt (1877–1952). Reichelt was sent to Hunan province in China in 1904. There he gradually developed an idea to share the gospel with Buddhists. In 1929, he established Jing Fong Shan in Nanjing. In 1930, due to the chaos of the Chinese civil war, Reichelt moved his work to Sha Tin, Hong Kong, and asked a Danish architect, Johannes Prip-Moller to design the buildings. Reichelt died on 13 March 1952 and was buried at the Tao Fong Shan cemetery.
