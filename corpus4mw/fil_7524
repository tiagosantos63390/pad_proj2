Seppmann, with help from some fellow masons, built the first of the walls before being interrupted by financial difficulties and the outbreak of the Dakota War of 1862. He resumed work the next summer, joined now by neighbor Herman Hegley. Using a ramp and a wheelbarrow to convey material up the growing structure, they finished construction in 1864. Seppmann carved most of the wooden machinery himself with an axe, except for two metal cog wheels and the millstones, which had to be purchased from St. Louis for $600.
