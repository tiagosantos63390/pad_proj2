On June 11, 2010 Detective Bryan Yant, was involved in a controversial fatal shooting of Trevon Cole. He was reassigned to duty as a desk officer following findings that officer Yant had violated several police department policies regarding the preparation and serving of the warrant, in addition to several minor violations. Yant had shot at least three other people in the line of duty up to that point. On January 18, 2012, the family of Trevon Cole (who had been killed by Yant) received a settlement from the LVMPD Fiscal Affairs Committee of 1.7 million dollars (which is the highest amount ever awarded by LVMPD). In addition, it was shown that Bryan Yant made several mistakes when he focused on Trevon Cole and that David Roger (former District Attorney for Clark County, Nevada) and other prosecutors did not believe Bryan Yant's accounting of the shooting.
During the Catalan Revolt, in 1641 he won the important Battle of Tarragona (August 1641) against the French fleet under Henri de Sourdis, thus lifting the siege of the city.
