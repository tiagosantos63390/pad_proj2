â€œLady Gladys Herbert and Later Countess of Lonsdale was superbly beautiful, with brilliant colouring and the features and carriage of an ideal Roman Empress. We were great friends and at one time almost inseparable. I spent part of one summer with her at Lowther Castle soon after her first marriage and she met me at Carlisle Station with her pony car to drive me to the Castle. As we wisked through the Park and the impressive walls of Lowther loomed before us she intimated that the one thing she was most anxious for me to see was the emu strutting about the grass."

Though Bangalore is a hub for both classical and contemporary music, the dominant music genre in urban Bangalore is rock music. All sub-genres of rock, varying from classic rock n' roll to extreme metal can be heard in Bangalore.

Rock 'N India, Great Indian Rock, Deccan Rock and Summer Storm Festival are the primitive rock festivals in India. In early 2012, the Bangalore Open Air metal festival (powered by Wacken Open Air festival), to be headlined by Iced Earth and Kreator, and to be held on 16 June was announced.

As our age produces new data and experiences, we require a new, expanded rhetoric which takes into account technology. The modern world has progressed quite far but it has not yet found a "logos" which is able to make sense of "techne" (technology = "techne" + "logos"). The sciences alone cannot hope to be productive without reincorporating rhetoric otherwise they would only be analytic. For McKeon a new rhetoric is the only means of bridging the gap between arts and sciences. Incorporating rhetoric may permit the further development of new fields of arts and sciences. Rhetoric is able to navigate among the various kinds of arts and sciences providing an opportunity to interrelate them and set new ends which makes use of both spheres. The new rhetoric can order all the other arts and sciences resulting in new discoveries. Mckeon deemed a very forceful rhetorical strategy capable of avoiding relativism as with a very forceful rhetorical strategy a solidarity is gained as people are supposedly unified via a forceful rhetoric. Relativism is avoided according to McKeon via the force of a rhetorical strategy rather than via access to a Platonic realm.

Nuclear sclerosis appears as a bilateral bluish-grey haziness at the nucleus, or center of the lens, caused by an increase in the refractive index of that part of the lens due to its increased density. It is often confused with cataracts. The condition is differentiated from a cataract by its appearance and by shining a penlight into the eye. With nuclear sclerosis, a reflection from the tapetum will be seen, while a cataract will block reflection.

After a few hours left alone, Milla goes to the law office to find Matt. After discovering he's out being Daredevil, Foggy volunteers to take Milla home, accompanied by Lily Lucca, toward whom Milla has extremely hostile tendencies. While in the subway station, Lily attempts to be helpful, only to be met with an exclamation of, "Just die, bitch!" before Milla tries to push her in front of an oncoming train. Lily bumps into an older man, who ends up falling in front of the train and dying instead (Daredevil's plot as this happens involves a drug whose effects have yet to be fully explained, and Milla is acting strangely). Milla seems appalled by what she's apparently just done. Meanwhile, Daredevil is being incapacitated by Mr. Fear, who claims to know Milla, and has given her the drug. Milla was then put under house arrest, awaiting a trial, then hospitalized in a mental institution, where she has been completely isolated from Matt.
