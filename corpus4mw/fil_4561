Based on light δ13C values, the origin of the hydrate gas is biogenic. Researchers also noted that some of the hydrates appeared to occur in the sandy layers of the cores.

Early life and education.
In 1917 Amy stayed for seven weeks with Florence Cunningham (1871–1950) at her home in Bayswater. Florence was a mystic who believed herself to be a prophet whom the voices she heard addressed as “Mary”: she compared herself to Abraham, Isaiah and The Messiah, but it should be said that she was later, for a short period, committed to the care of the Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey. Florence's daughter was Edith Cunningham, then 18, whom Amy had met at St Paul's Girls' School.
