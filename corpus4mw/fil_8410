Funds for party activity (be it campaigning or routine operations) can be solicited via "grassroots fundraising" as party membership dues or other voluntary contributions from individuals (e.g. direct mail fundraising) or as "plutocratic funding" from wealthy people and/ or the business community as corporate donations. Since the 1960s an additional source of political revenue, public subsidies, is spreading among the democracies. Despite such multitude of promising options political fundraising via political corruption (e.g. influence peddling, graft, extortion, kickbacks, embezzlement) is still around.

Leslie Street, which has four separate sections, begins at Lake Ontario at the foot of the Leslie Street Spit. Just north at Lake Shore Boulevard East was the former eastern terminus of the Gardiner Expressway. It continues north to the railway tracks north of Gerrard Street East, where the first segment ends. Donlands Avenue, which runs from the north side of the railway tracks to north of O'Connor Drive, was originally another segment of Leslie Street. The second segment is represented by a one-block stretch of road between Wicksteed Avenue and Vanderhoof Avenue in the Leaside Industrial land area. It is separated from the third segment by the Ernest Thompson Seton parklands.
