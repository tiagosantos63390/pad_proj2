Beer production continued for forty years until Prohibition began in 1920, forcing breweries to close their doors or change production. Luckily Fitger's was able to find demanded products other than beer to produce, and was one of the few brewers in the entire country that remained open throughout Prohibition. Fitger and Anneke sold their shares and retired in California. Percys son Victor H Anneke, who had taken over from his father in 1920, wanted to keep as many employees as possible working at Fitger's, but the beer product sales alone could not justify the employment level. In order to keep employees, he decided to get into soft drink and candy manufacturing, and cigar distributing. Fitger and Anneke had set out a strategy several years prior in order to keep the brewery open during Prohibition, which they only expected to last a short time. The company produced five cent candy bars such as The King Bee Nougat, the Flapper, the Spark Plug, the Nut Goodie, and the Skookum. Candy sales steadily increased for several years, but did not prove to be profitable for the company. 
The first cornerstone for the new college was laid in June 1888, and the building was completed in September 1889. The building cost almost half a million dollars and was a gift from local merchant and banker, John Crouse, and his son, D. Edgar Crouse. The elder Crouse was a trustee of the university and built the college as a memorial to his wife. The architect, Archimedes Russell, exceeded the original budget.
It lies approximately south-west of Trzebnica, and north of the regional capital Wrocław.

The Tigers captured their first state championship in 1924 in boy's track. This win ended a four year streak held by the Albuquerque Bulldogs who took second place.
