B â€“ 5+6 = 11
Stunned, Wolverine tries to calm her down as her powers begin to destroy the hospital wing around them, Jean unable to control her impulses. She tearfully begs Logan to kill her before she kills another person. Logan refuses, reassuring her that she'll be alright if she lets Charles help her. But the Phoenix, enraged, blasts Wolverine into the wall hard enough to break the wall and exits the room, disintegrating and blasting the heavy metal doors out of her way. When Xavier and Storm find Wolverine, he tells them that Cyclops is dead, which shocks Storm but seems to confirm Xavier's fears. Despite Phoenix trying to block him out, Xavier manages to locate her. Meanwhile, one of Magneto's new followers who can sense mutant powers tells Magneto that a Class 5 mutant, more powerful than anything ever sensed, has come into being. Understanding immediately, Magneto demands to know where she is.
