In October 2009, Chocolate Lab Records was involved in a minor dispute regarding iTunes' new iTunes LP format. Label owner Brian McKinney contacted his distributor in order to get information on creating and submitting iTunes LPs for their artists and was told that indie labels were not being considered for iTunes LPs and that if they were the cost of entry would be $10,000. He reported his findings to tech website Gizmodo who posted a blog about the situation. A week later Apple reps began contacting websites and blogs to dispute McKinney's claims and to announce that iTunes LPs would be available to everyone soon. It's unclear whether McKinney was involved in changing an Apple policy or if it was just a misunderstanding and/or coincidence.

Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the nuclei in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70% when there is a deficiency which affects a person’s abilities for higher cognitive function. In a study by the University Of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a Radial arm maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15 day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had Vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here it was found that the Retinoid receptors which help transport Vitamin A were of normal function.
