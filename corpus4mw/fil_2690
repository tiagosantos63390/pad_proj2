In the 2012 election incumbents Gary Peters and Hansen Clarke faced off against each other with Southfield Mayor Brenda Lawrence and two other Democrats also running. The district had been redrawn, including very little of the old district, but covering a good portion of Detroit, Grosse Pointe, Southfield, Farmington Hills, Pontiac and a few other places in Oakland County, Michigan. Preliminary reports showed Peters winning with 47% of the vote to Clarke's 35% and Lawrence's 13%.
