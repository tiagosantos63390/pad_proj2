Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman came to San Diego for Goldman to give her speech "An Enemy of the People" on May 15, 1912. When the two arrived at the train station the same women that allegedly needed protection from the soapbox orators yelled "Give us that anarchist; we will strip her naked; we will tear out her guts." Mayor of San Diego James E. Wadham offered a warning, but no help to the two activists. Reitman was abducted by vigilantes from his hotel room and tortured. He later recalled,

After the end of the inconclusive War of 1812, the militia system in Ohio abandoned its regimental formations and reverted to multiple small units representing the various municipalities throughout the rapidly growing state. With the last Indians expelled from the state's borders and peaceful relations along the Canadian border, there seemed little need for a fully armed and trained militia. With the brief exception of a border dispute with Michigan that caused the Governor to issue a militia call up, meaningful local militia musters and drills again became more the exception than the rule. The Mexican-American War in 1848 saw a renewed interest in vitalizing the militia throughout the entire country. With the regular U.S. Army at a strength of just over 13,000, it became evident that any successful military campaign against Mexico was going to require extensive militia involvement. Ohio played a significant role, raising several regiments of infantry and artillery batteries from existing militia units and volunteers. The 1st Ohio Volunteers comprised part of the army under Gen. Zachary Taylor and took part in the battlefield victories of Monterrey and Buena Vista.

Muscle coactivation is a phenomenon in which a muscle is activated coordinately with another muscle. The EMG shown demonstrates the antagonistic muscle activity in the biceps and triceps of a relaxed and seated subject, with the elbow bent at 90 degrees increase in the activity of the triceps. Likewise, there is a minor increase of activity in the biceps trace when the triceps is activated. Coactivation of the muscles stabilizes a joint, although the mechanism is not well understood. Muscular coactivation is thought to be required for fine movements.
Under its porch is a chapel containing the oven said to have been used for St. Lawrence's martyrdom.
