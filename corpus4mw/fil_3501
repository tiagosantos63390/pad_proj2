Discussing Boko Haram and its strategy to incite retaliatory sectarian violence, Azazi said, "Have we thought of what their ultimate intentions are? Why will somebody go on to bomb Christians on a Christmas Day? Look at the ultimate intentions. Do they want to really raise tempers elsewhere?" Boko Haram terms Nigeria an "enemy of Islam" and seeks the disintegration of Nigeria as a country.

The old stadium that used to sit on the same lot, McDermott Field, was at risk of being closed down in 2005 due to a lack of funding and viewed unsuitable to continue to serve as a public stadium. The City of Idaho Falls began a fund raiser called "Step Up To The Plate" in 2004 in an attempt to save the ballpark, but the funds fell far short of the needed $1.3 Million as the fundraiser approached its deadline. A last minute saving donation of $600,000 by Melaleuca, Inc delivered the day before the fund raising deadline providing the required remaining funds necessary to move forward with the renovation. The city of Idaho Falls renamed the ballpark "Melaleuca Field" as a thank you to Melaleuca for the $600,000 donation that saved the ballpark.
"A Song of Summer" derived from an unpublished 1918 symphonic work, originally called "Poem of Life and Love". In 1921, Delius told Peter Warlock that he had misplaced most of that score. Delius resumed work on this composition after becoming blind, dictating the notes to his amanuensis, Eric Fenby, to whom the score was dedicated. 
"Don't You Ever Leave Me" made its first appearance on Hanoi Rocks' first album "Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks", but it had more punky atmosphere and faster tempo. They remade the version, which the band loved much more. It is usually considered one of the best songs by Hanoi Rocks. The band's guitarist Andy McCoy commented on the song in Finnish Soundi magazine in 1984: "Well, yeah, we screwed up that song so bad back then, that we had to remake it now. As a song, I think it's fucking great and this version is what the original should have been.".

At one point, a group called the Shiva Lila became part of the commune until they were asked to leave by the other members. "The New York Times" describes them as a "nomadic cult of acid-taking, baby-worshiping hippies looking for the perfect place to bring up children" and they were led by a man called Gridley Wright.
is not a proper distance metric as it does not possess the property of triangle inequality. The simplest counterexample of this is given by the three sets {a}, {b}, and {a,b}, the distance between the first two being 1, and the difference between the third and each of the others being one-third. To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of "any" two of these three sides must be greater than the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1.
