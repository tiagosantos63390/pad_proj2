Yumie is a katana-wielding Japanese nun. She is a fanatical Catholic and seems to genuinely enjoy killing people with her almost superhuman sword skills. She knows various Batto-jutsu (sword drawing) techniques and is adept enough to kill even from outside the room where her victim is, but is quite capable of smashing men's heads into walls with her bare hands as well. Yumiko has commented how hard it is for her to "get Yumie to sleep" after she has been provoked into action. Her personalities switch places, either by duelling for control inside of their mind, or a strong blow. Heinkel uses this technique to awaken the latent Yumie and have her brutally kill several terrorists in the first volume of the manga's extra Crossfire feature.

Born in Sarajevo, Sušić emigrated with his family early in his life to Belgium. He started training with the second-tier C.S. Visé, before moving to the youth side of KRC Genk. At the age of 16, he moved to Standard Liège. In August 2010, he was called up to the Belgium U19 side, featuring in two matches as a substitute, playing a friendly match for the Standard Liège first team as well. Not breaking through, he continued playing for the team's U21 and reserve sides.
In November 2006, Wu's car was involved in a speeding offence, travelling at more than 90 kph on a road where the speed limit was 60 kph. He was eventually charged with abetting his clinic's maintenance technician, Kuan Yit Wah, in providing misleading information to the police about which of them was driving the car at that time. In June 2012, he was fined S$1,000 for abetment. Some members of the public, including Hri Kumar Nair (a member of parliament and a Senior Counsel), expressed surprise that he was given only a fine instead of a prison term. There was also a short debate over the case in the Singapore Parliament between K. Shanmugam (the Law Minister) and Sylvia Lim (a member of parliament from the opposition Workers' Party). The Attorney General's Chambers said the charge and sentence were appropriate based on the law that was in force in 2006.
