From the car park in Penicuik follow the signage crossing the Bowstring Bridge through Beeslack Wood then cross the Firth viaduct.This bridge has 10 arches, is 66 feet high and each arch spans 35 feet. Roslin Glen Country Park will soon be reached followed by the disused Rosslyn Castle station. Shortly after this the route passes the small town of Rosewell then after a mile or so Bonnyrigg is reached. A few miles further on the town of Eskbank is passed. After crossing the Glenesk viaduct the route finishes close to the A 720 City of Edinburgh bypass. It is,of course, possible to do the walk in the opposite direction.
