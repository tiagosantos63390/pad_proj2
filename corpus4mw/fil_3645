The route is still considered an important corridor by the Metropolitan Council. In the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Transportation Policy Plan, West Seventh Street and East Seventh Street are two of nine arterial streets that are recommended for bus rapid transit. The arterial bus rapid transit ways are located in built up areas that have limited right of ways, making light rail or dedicated bus ways not feasible. The corridors would have limited stop service and use technology improvements to shorten trip times. The Metropolitan Council plans to build six of the nine by 2020 and the rest by 2030. Some of the corridors are also being studied for other transit modes. On January 23, 2013, the Saint Paul City Council voted in favor of requesting the Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority to conduct a new transit study of the Riverview Corridor.
