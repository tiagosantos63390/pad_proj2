GamesRadar editor Brett Elston praised Raticate as a great Pokémon early in the game, but criticized it for losing its usefulness later in the game. While she found it to be a Pokémon that has difficulties later in the game, IGN's "Pokémon of the Day Chick" called Raticate a "nasty surprise" for opponents. She also called Raticate "one of the single most underrated Pokemon in existence". 1UP.com's Michael Vreeland commented that Raticate's "Super Fang" technique was annoying for players when another trainer had it use it on their Pokémon. IGN wrote that while it has the same problems as Rattata does, it has a high attack power.
In 1991, he played on the Laois team beaten by Meath in the final of the Leinster Senior Football Championship but 12 years later (in 2003) he was part of the Laois team that ended a 57 year wait for the title. He also won O'Byrne Cup medals in 1991 and 1994.
