Islam used to write from his childhood. While reading in class six, he published his writing in a magazine, "Shikkhok Samachar". During his university days as a student, his friend's father fell sick and died in pain. This emotionally affected Islam and led him to write his first story, "Bishal Mrittu" in 1973. It received a positive response; but he abstained from publishing anything during his days in Canada. On his return to Bangladesh, he returned to writing and began contributing a regular column "Olosh Diner Hawa" in the literary section of the "Dainik Sangbad". He wrote on issues including art and literature. In 1989, Islam started writing for the magazine "Bichinta", which published many of his post-modern stories.
