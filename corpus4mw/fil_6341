Missouri fought a hard battle and barely won the time of possession battle, at one point drawing within 6 points, but a 57 yard interception return for a touchdown opened the game up a bit as Nebraska gained enough room to finish the game ahead by 10.

In the college's first academic year (2008-2009)it accommodated from the original school year ranges of both schools, 5-8. The next year the range increased by 1 to include a year 9 and the school took in a new year 5 (this was the College's final whole year intake until 2012). Each year until 2013 a new higher year was added to the College's age range. At the beginning of the college's academic year 2013-2014 it had reached its goal to become a full secondary school and sixth form. As the lowest year progressed to the consecutive years above them the lower years they had finished were removed from the college's range. It was unique in the United Kingdom in accommodating these age ranges, a reflection of its transformational status from middle to high school.

Aside from providing the "Monkey Island" license to Telltale, LucasArts' role in the game's development involved collaboration and approval of the game's script, character concept art and puzzle design. As the remake of "The Secret of Monkey Island" had begun development before "Tales of Monkey Island", LucasArts shared their art style guide with Telltale, so that the two products' art direction would be similar. In particular, LucasArts wished that the character of Guybrush would be comparable to the appearance of the character in the special edition. LucasArts largely based their vision for Guybrush's new visuals in "Tales of Monkey Island" on how the character appeared in "The Curse of Monkey Island", integrating various aspects from "LeChuck's Revenge" that commonly resonated through fan art, such as the character's blue coat and beard, in addition to using their own stylized art direction. Telltale concept artist Ryan Jones worked closely with LucasArts' Jeff Sengalli on developing the appearance of Guybrush and other characters, Sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes, facial features and clothing. Vanaman noted that LucasArts was open to Telltale's creative direction for the game, and did not "put their foot down" over any aspects of their vision.
