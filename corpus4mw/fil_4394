The song first entered the UK Singles Chart at 46 in 2007. However, following her death the song re-entered the chart at a new peak of 33.
In the cases of "Rush" and "The Bottom Line" this had the effect of condensing the songs into simpler pop song structures. "The Bottom Line" for example in its single edit did not feature the introductory 'Horses are on the track' section.

The edit featured removes the entire 'Rhythm and Melody' breakdown.
