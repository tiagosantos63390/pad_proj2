History.
In the original film, Bakekang had only one child; in the series, Bakekang has two, one beautiful and one ugly. Nadine Samonte was supposed to play the role of Bakekang’s beautiful daughter Kristal, but she couldn’t sing. Jackie Rice was also considered to play Kristal, but she was suspended by the network for attitude problems. GMA Network was going back to their original choice, Yasmien Kurdi, but they decided to give her a more challenging role. Kurdi was given the role of Charming, the ugly daughter and the role of Kristal was given to newcomer singer Lovi Poe, the daughter of the late acting legend Fernando Poe Jr.. In addition, Nadine Samonte was given the role of Lorraine, the rival of Lovi Poe in fame.
