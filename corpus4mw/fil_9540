Jonny Cruz was born Jonathan Willie Hernández in El Paso, Texas on December 1, 1982 and is the son of Maritza Pagan and Orlando Hernández, younger brother of two children with his sister Sharlene. Jonny chose to use Cruz as his last name in honor of his Grandmother Nayda Cruz. He attended School in El Paso TX and studied abroad in Würzburg, Germany in early grade school. Jonny started acting and performing in his early years in the fourth grade with his first rôle as Brom Bones in the play “"Sleepy Hollow"”. He continued his studies and never lost the chance to keep performing at Eastwood High School and went on to study acting and filmmaking at the University of Texas at Arlington. The ability to be so completely lost in the moment and find perfection through performance and filmmaking attracted Jonny to the art form. Jonny found himself fascinated with Improv Comedy performance and joined the well known "Four Day Weekend Performance Team " in Fort Worth. Nevertheless, while performing, Jonny continued to shoot short videos to showcase his comedic and technical talents.
