During his Papacy, Gabriel VIII decreed that the Fast of the Apostles must start on 21 Paoni and end on 5 Epip, and that Advent must start on the first of Koiak. He also cancelled the Fast of Jonah, and left the Fast of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary optional. All the Copts at that time approved of these decisions, but reverted to the old tradition of fasting after his departure.

Practitioners of the Chöd ritual, "Chödpa," use a "kangling" or human thighbone trumpet, and a Chöd drum, a hand drum similar to but larger than the ḍamaru commonly used in Tibetan ritual. In a version of the Chöd "sādhana" of Jigme Lingpa from the Longchen Nyingthig "terma", five ritual knives ("phurbas"), are employed to demarcate the "maṇḍala" of the offering and to affix the five wisdoms.

On 25 July 1999 the Special Clerical Court convicted Khoeiniha as Salam's publisher "of defamation and spreading false information in connection with the alleged memo". He was sentenced to three years in prison and a lashing. However, the court suspended this sentence and reduced his sentence to a fine of 23 million rials (US$13,000), "because of his sterling revolutionary credentials". Less than two weeks later the Clergy court "imposed a five-year ban on Salam and banned Musavi-Khoeiniha from practicing journalism for three years". The court ruled that the journalist was "guilty of disseminating untruthful and distorted news aimed at harming public opinion."
