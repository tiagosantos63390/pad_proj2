Björk — "It's Oh So Quiet" (Choreographer: Michael Rooney)
Event.
On 21 March 1945 the ship sailed for Mobile, Alabama where she was placed out of commission on 31 March to be fitted out as a landing craft repair ship by the Alabama Drydock & Shipbuilding Company. The conversion was completed that summer, and USS "Bellerophon" (ARL-31) was recommissioned on 21 July 1945 at Mobile with Lieutenant Samuel H. Alexander, USNR, in command. On 31 July the ship began a fortnight's shakedown cruise that took her to Galveston, Texas. She returned to Mobile on 14 August and began preparations for an overseas deployment. On 1 September "Bellerophon" departed Mobile and headed for the Pacific Ocean. After transiting the Panama Canal, she headed up the west coast toward San Francisco. She made a stop at San Diego before arriving at Treasure Island on 3 October. There, the ship began duty as the repair ship for a newly formed boat pool. When a strike by civilian workers paralyzed civilian yards during the latter part of October, "Bellerophon" began making voyage repairs to Operation Magic Carpet ships while also carrying out some conversion work to enable attack cargo ships to serve as passenger carriers.
