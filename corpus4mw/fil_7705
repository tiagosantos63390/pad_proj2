Wynebald de Ballon (variously spelt Baalun, Baalan, Balun, Balodun, Balon etc.), (c.1058–c.1126), was an early Norman magnate. He was a son of Drogo (or Dru) de Ballon and appeared in England accompanied by his brothers, Hamelin de Ballon, later created 1st Baron of Abergavenny, and Wynoc de Ballon, about whom little is recorded. Whether any of the family fought at Hastings is unknown, but the two well-known brothers certainly assisted in the process of subjugating the English and Welsh which followed the Norman Invasion, as their many grants of land, given in gratitude for their services, attest.

In mathematics, the rational points on the unit circle are those points ("x", "y") such that both "x" and "y" are rational numbers ("fractions") and satisfy "x"2 + "y"2 = 1. The set of such points turns out to be closely related to primitive Pythagorean triples. Consider a primitive right triangle, that is, with integral side lengths "a", "b", "c", with "c" the hypotenuse, such that the sides have no common factor larger than 1. Then on the unit circle there exists the rational point ("a"/"c", "b"/"c"), which, in the complex plane, is just "a"/"c" + "ib"/"c", where "i" is the imaginary unit. Conversely, if ("x", "y") is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system (i.e. "x" > 0, "y" > 0), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides "xc", "yc", "c", with "c" being the least common multiple of "x" and "y" denominators. There is a correspondence between points ("x","y") in the "x"-"y" plane and points "x" + "iy" in the complex plane which will be used below, with ("a", "b") taken as equal to "a" + "ib".
