Relatively little of Bartolomeo's music has survived. Only fifteen pieces are found in sources of the period: ten secular songs, a lauda, and four instrumental compositions. The songs are in the characteristic style of the popular music of the period, with simple rhythms, homophonic texture, clear phrasing, and they are in strophic form. Eight are ballatas. In spite of his close association with Ss Annunziata, only a single sacred composition has survived, the lauda "Sguardate il Salvatore", and that is probably an adaptation of a secular song.
