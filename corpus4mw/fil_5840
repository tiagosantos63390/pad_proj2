He was born in Vancouver. At the 1960 Summer Olympics he was the stroke (Captain) of the Canadian boat that won the silver medal in the eights event. This was the only medal the Canadians won that year.
Following his study in Rome, between 1817 and 1821 Huyot traveled in Asia Minor, Egypt, and Greece.
Adults of "Cyclemys" also develop a joint in the middle of their plastrons (known as a plastral hinge), enabling them to articulate the front and rear halves to some extent. Unlike the closely related "Cuora", which can completely close its shell because of the hinge, "Cyclemys" plastral hinges only close the shell partially. The plastral hinge may also play a significant role in facilitating egg-laying in adult females.
