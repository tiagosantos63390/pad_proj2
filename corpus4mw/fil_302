also expressed concerns about these changes. A former Director, Betty Churcher, was particularly critical of the building and reportedly told a Sydney journalist that "the dead hand of an architect cannot stay clamped on a building forever". When Ron Radford became Director, he expanded the brief to include a suite of new galleries to display the collection of indigenous art and a new Australian Garden fronting King Edward Terrace.

HEAT warheads become much less effective if they are rapidly spinning, which became a challenge for weapon designers: for a long time, spinning the shell was the most standard method for obtaining good accuracy, as with any rifled gun. However, the centrifugal force of a spinning shell disperses the charge jet. Consequently, most hollow charge projectiles are fin-stabilized and not spin-stabilized. The round could be fired from smoothbore barrel, losing some accuracy.
Various versions of the alleged message exist.
In contrast, philosophers who define the right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant, and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species "Homo sapiens" is in itself morally relevant).
Fontane changed myriad details so as not to imperil their privacy. He also made changes for the sake of drama. Elisabeth married at age 19 instead of 17, with Ardenne being five and not twenty years her senior. She fell in love with Hartwich after twelve years – not twelve months – of marriage, and Ardenne did not kill her paramour years after the dalliance, but when they were still courting. Fontane knew that Elisabeth did not retreat like Effi; instead, she began to work and devote herself to the needy. Elisabeth died at 98; Effi dies at 29.
The philosopher Hayashi Razan lists the greatest of these "daitengu" as Sōjōbō of Kurama, Tarōbō of Atago, and Jirōbō of Hira. The demons of Kurama and Atago are among the most famous "tengu".

The introduction of Vladislav's charter says: "Stefan Vladislav, with the help and grace of God, crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime Lands"; while the signature reads: "Stefan Vladislav, by the grace of God, the King and Autokrator of All Serbian and Maritime Lands". He also sometimes signed as "Stefan Vladislav, with the help of God, the Serbian King". One seal of his reads "King of all "Rascian" lands. With the canonization of Serbian royalty, some had their born names used by the church, such as Stefan Vladislav ("Св. Стефан Владислав, краљ српски"), Milutin, Stefan Uroš I, Stefan Uroš II, Urošica, and others.
The elder of these two works, the "Shijing" (also familiarly known, in English, as the "Classic of Poetry" and as the "Book of Songs" or transliterated as the "Sheh Ching") is a preserved collection of Classical Chinese poetry from over two millennia ago. This anthology received its final compilation sometime in the 7th century BCE. The collection contains both aristocratic poems regarding life at the royal court ("Odes") and also more rustic poetry and images of natural settings, derived at least to some extent from folk songs ("Songs"). The "Shijing" poems are predominantly composed of four-character lines( 四言), rather than the five and seven character lines typical of later Classical Chinese poetry.
Despite the wars and unrest, Galați developed based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Galați was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, James Buchanan, the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Galați and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Galați was also a trading port for German lands. When the Crimean War (1854–1856) finished, Galați became a seat of the Danube European Commission. In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V. A. Urechia library opened.
