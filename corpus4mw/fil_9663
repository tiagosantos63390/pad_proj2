To figure out who shoots first, players usually throw or role a baseball to a certain object (usually at close range) and whoever is closest shoots first. The first person then gets to choose the first hole and tees off. To tee off (and for most shots) players hit the ball like they were playing Baseball, but depending on the distance from the hole the player may choose to ‘putt’ the ball instead of hitting it. To putt the ball, the player places the ball on the cup (the end of the Fungo Bat), and can toss the ball from the cup in hopes of getting a more accurate shot In shooting or putting, the player must have one foot where the ball landed during the entire duration of their swing or putt, failure to keep the foot planted results in a loss of a stroke. Scorekeeping is identical to traditional golf, the player with the least amount of strokes essentially wins the hole Players traditionally play nine or eighteen holes of Fungo Golf, and at the end the person with the least amount of strokes in the set amount of holes wins the game
