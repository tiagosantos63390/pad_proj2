Design and development.
The university incorporated its four campuses in 1984 under the University of Ulster banner; these are located in Belfast, Coleraine (site of the administrative headquarters), Magee College in Derry, and Jordanstown. A fifth distance learning campus, "Campus One", delivers online programmes; mainly at graduate level.
The adult male has a bizarre wing ornament during the breeding season, with a broad central flight feather on each wing elongated to 38 cm, much longer than the bird's body. 20 cm or more of this is bare shaft. In normal flight, these feathers trail behind, but in display flight they are raised vertically like standards. Outside the breeding season, there are no plumage distinctions between the male and female.

Decommissioned in the 1980s, "Ponchatoula" was placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as USNS "Ponchatoula" (T-AO-148) where she served with the Seventh Fleet in the Persian Gulf during Operation Fiery Vigil, Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. She was badly damaged in a collision with the guided missile cruiser "USS Chancellorsville (CG62)" in August of 1991. The "Chancellorsville" suffered a steering casualty during underway replenishment operations and heeled sharply to port, ramming the "Ponchatoula's" starboard side at the Bridge, then sliding down the starboard side of the ship, buckling the upper deck plates of the "Ponchatoula" to the engine house and damaging the "Chancellorsville's" hurricane bow and sonar dome. "Ponchatoula" was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1992; her title was transferred to MARAD on 1 May 1999 for lay-up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. MARAD listed "Ponchatoula" still at Suisun Bay in February 2007. She was towed from Suisun Bay on June 5th, 2014 to be dismantled in Brownsville, Texas. Her final voyage is chronicled at http://navy.memorieshop.com/Ponchatoula/Last-Voyage.html. 
More generally, the GNS construction shows that every state is, after a suitable representation, a vector state.

This safeguard was required due to the forcible "re-Catholicization" of Astruc's Languedoc homeland in the frame of the Counter-Reformation, when the Protestant "Camisards" were being deported or sent to the galleys, was a very recent memory. In Astruc's own times the writers of the "Encyclopédie" were working under great pressure and in secret, for the Catholic Church did not offer a tolerant atmosphere for biblical criticism. This was somewhat ironic, for Astruc saw himself as fundamentally a supporter of orthodoxy; his unorthodoxy lay not in denying Mosaic authorship of Genesis, but in his defence of it. In the previous century scholars such as Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza had drawn up long lists of inconsistencies and contradictions and anachronisms in the Torah, and used these to argue that Moses could not have been the author of the entire five books. Astruc was outraged by this "sickness of the last century", and determined to use modern 18th century scholarship to refute that of the 17th. Using methods already well established in the study of the Classics for sifting and assessing differing manuscripts, he drew up parallel columns and assigned verses to each of them according to what he had noted as the defining features of the text of Genesis: whether a verse used the term "YHWH" (Yahweh) or the term "Elohim" (God) referring to God, and whether it had a doublet (another telling of the same incident, as for example the two accounts of the creation of man, and the two accounts of Sarah being taken by a foreign king). Astruc found four documents in Genesis, which he arranged in four columns, declaring that this was how Moses had originally written his book, in the image of the four Gospels of the New Testament, and that a later writer had combined them into a single work, creating the repetitions and inconsistencies which Hobbes, Spinoza and others had noted.
Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans, which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending. Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.

With the waning of Seleucid Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into Characene or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 127 BC. A building inscription found in Bahrain indicate that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mentions his wife, Thalassia). From the third century BC to arrival of Islam in the seventh century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties of Parthians and Sassanids.
A dive brake was fitted aft of the tail, with rear-hinged single dorsal and ventral "petals" to deploy using a jackscrew during anticipated dive bombing missions. These features increased the design's weight to . Dornier had intended the speed to be in the region of .

On June 13, 2011, THQ announced the closure of Kaos Studios (the developer of "Homefront") and THQ Digital Warrington (formerly Juice Games).

In the same year on August 9, 2011, THQ announced it would shift its development focus away from licensed kids and movie-based titles by closing down THQ Studio Australia and Blue Tongue in order to focus on "high-quality owned IP." The company also closed down THQ Digital Phoenix (formerly Rainbow Studios), thus dropping the "MX vs. ATV" franchise.

Jing'an District was named after Jing'an Temple, an ancient traditional Chinese Buddhist temple, today's temple is a new replica of the old one, located in the southern part of the district. An Art Deco "dancehall" is just across the street; around the neighborhood are bar streets, although some areas develop and other close through the years. The Jing'an park, located opposite to the temple, is quite popular among locals; it used to be a graveyard for foreigners in the old Shanghai. 
In 1976, Léo Ferré signed with CBS Records International. From this date until the end of his career the majority of his recordings would be made with the Milan-based RAI National Symphony Orchestra under his conducting. CBS would quickly get rid of Ferré, whose commercial potential was estimated too low (his new aesthetics of symphonic down-tempo being against the current of all musical trends, it was complicated now to put the artist on radio and reduced the possibility of a hit). Being dropped by the "professionals", disgusted for good with being "a merchandise for producers", Ferré decided in 1979 to become his own producer, renting studio, orchestra and technicians at his own expense, which would lead him to a kind of "never-ending tour" of his own, in order to pay the price for his liberty in the making of his albums.
