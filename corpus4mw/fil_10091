The temple has all the basic elements of a standard Hoysala temple and comprises a sanctum which is connected to a closed hall by a square vestibule ("sukhanasi"). The entrance into the hall from the outside is through a porch ("mukhamantapa"). Typically, a closed hall in a Hoysala temple has no windows. The porch consists of a awning supported by two decorative half pillars with two parapets on both sides. The shrine has a tower (called "sikhara"). The vestibule has its own tower (also called "sukhanasi") which appears like a low extension of the main tower over the shrine. Art critic Gerard Foekema calls it the "nose" of the main tower. From the outside, the walls of the vestibule are inconspicuous and appear like a short extension of the shrine wall. The ceiling of the closed hall is supported by four lathe turned pillars. These pillars divide the ceiling into nine highly decorated bays. Between full pilasters, the outer walls of the hall and shrine are decorated with turrets and miniature towers on half-pilasters (aedicula). Below these, forming the base of the temple, are the five horizontal moldings.

"Haunted" is a two-part song, consisting of "Ghost" and "Haunted" respectively running for a length of approximately six minutes. Its composition was described as ranging from contemporary R&B to "straight up experimentalism". "Mojo" Priya Elan compared the song's composition with works by English band The xx. The song features sexually explicit and frank lyrics in line with a prominent theme of the album about sexuality also present in other songs. Its instrumentation consists of "murky" keyboards and a "creeping", pulsating bassline.
