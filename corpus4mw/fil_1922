Payroll accounts also verify that the unit remained activated through 1765.

King Adora recorded their second album throughout 2003 at Hijack Studios in Redditch with Dodgy singer Nigel Clark. The band set a tentative release date for the album of late October 2003, to be preceded by single releases in June and August, but all the dates were later pushed back. Despite the record label problems, Grimmit said "the album we’re going to release eventually is much better than what we would have done if things hadn’t have happened". Putting the album out to the highest bidder, the band signed a contract with Discovery Recordings and cancelled their deal with MH Records. The first official single from the album, "Drag/9" Of Pure Malice", was finally released on 24 November 2003, reaching 85 in the charts. The single was backed by an 11-date UK tour, featuring support from The Glitterati and corporation:blend. Browne stated during the tour that "we’re just more resilient than we thought we were and we’ve come back out and this tour especially has been really really good".
