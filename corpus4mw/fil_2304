Dungeon Fighter Online utilizes a guild system. Any player not already part of a guild can create a guild and then invite other players. The benefits of guilds are two-fold. First, when multiple members of the same guild are logged in to the same channel, all members gain additional experience in dungeons. Secondly, when guild members gain experience, the guild itself gains experience, and can level up as well. When a guild levels up, additional abilities are made available, such as increased stats for the whole guild or additional experience gains. Eventually, the guild can obtain a "Guild Hideout".

It was a contest; they played three songs and the one that got the most requests over the phone was the one they would add to the playlist. We were screamin' in the street, and knockin' on everybody's door, 'We got a record on the radio!'...That was the biggest high ever. Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face.
