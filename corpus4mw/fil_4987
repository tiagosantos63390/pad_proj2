Overview & Discussions

In 1879, having deflected the attempt of the Education Board to lower the status of the school, another scheme was promulgated by those connected with St. Bees. The school ceased to be a "Free" one, and the structure of the board of governors was altered for the first time in centuries. Queen's College, Oxford and Pembroke College, Cambridge now appointed two governors each onto the board; one governor was appointed by the magistrates of Cumberland and one by the Trustees of Whitehaven (Town and Harbour).

During the war the diamond mines where constantly being fought over making it unsafe for miners to work, and usually after the mine was taken by the other side there would be land mines planted everywhere. This made it difficult to extract the diamonds but did not prevent the MPLA or UNITA to use the diamonds to help fund the war. The constant military spending due to the vast amount of diamonds and oil in the country could have funded the war for another 27 years but the UNITA leader Savimbi was killed by MPLA soldiers in 2002 which led to an almost immediate cease fire.
By the end of 1845 it became clear that no peace was possible between LDS church members and antagonized locals. Mormon leaders negotiated a truce so that the Latter Day Saints could prepare to abandon the city. The winter of 1845-46 saw the enormous preparations for the Mormon Exodus via the Mormon Trail. In early 1846, the majority of the Latter Day Saints left the city. After the departure of the Mormons, the temple stood until destroyed by arsonists on November 19, 1848.
Though the country is rich in mining resources its exploration and extraction has contributed only about 1% of its GDP with an investment of 14 billion birr. To give a boost to the five-year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) for the mining sector launched by the government, incentives are proposed to be offered in terms of tax reduction from the present level of 35% to 25%. During 2013, a draft document has been placed before the House of Peoples’ Representatives for approval so that the sector becomes more competitive vis-à-vis those offered by neighboring countries.
