Mother Mary had to return to Rome in 1880 to resolve some legal difficulties for the congregation. She had to return yet again in June 1882, and this visit was to provide pivotal in the identity of the congregation. Firstly, she was given approval to open a house in Rome itself, which was a great honor. Secondly, she came into contact with the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor. As a consequence, she was able to return to her Franciscan roots, and was received into the Third Order of St. Francis at the Franciscan Church of Ara Coeli on the following 4 October, the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi.

He is also identical in appearance to Marin. The gangsters repeatedly mistake Marin for Juvett, while Juvett and Marin constantly exchange suitcases by mistake, leading to numerous farcical situations.
