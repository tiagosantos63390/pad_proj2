The 2010–11 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Tom Izzo who was in his 16th year at Michigan State. The team played their home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, MI, and competed in the Big Ten Conference. The Spartans finished the regular season with a 17–13 overall record, and went 9–9 in conference play. After beating Iowa and Purdue in the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans fell to Penn State in the semifinals. Michigan State was seeded No. 10 in the Southeast region of the 2011 NCAA Tournament, and faced the No. 7 seed UCLA Bruins in the second round. The Spartans trailed by as much as 23 points, only to rally late in the game and lose 76–78.

The Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) - full name 'Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)', is a Synthetic Aperture Radar which was launched from the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April (STS-59) and October (STS-68) of 1994. The radar was run by NASA's Space Radar Laboratory. SIR utilizes 3 radar frequencies: L band (24 cm wavelength), C band (6 cm) and X band (3 cm), allowing for study of geology, hydrology, ecology and oceanography. Comparing radar images to data collected by teams of people on the ground as well as aircraft and ships using simultaneous measurements of vegetation, soil moisture, sea state, snow and weather conditions during each flight.
The signals use the CP and PP pins with a 12 Volt potential from the charger. The analog signal protocol is simple enough to not require any digital electronics. The CP-PE loop is connected through a resistor to a +12 volt source through a 2740 ohm resistor. Connecting a compatible vehicle drops the voltage at the CP pin to 9 volts; this activates the wave generator. The vehicle activates the charger by adding a parallel 1300 ohm resistor (dropping the voltage to +6V), or a parallel 270 ohm resistor for ventilation (dropping voltage to +3V). A detector in the charger is triggered by the voltage level on CP-PE alone. The PP-PE loop is connected in the plug of the adapter cable specifying the wire cross section; if it is connected through to the vehicle then the it is pulled down with 2700 Ohm and additional resistors in the vehicle charging control can be used to set the current from the charger.
The aircraft also owes some of its design to the Midget Mustang. The fuselage is of aluminum construction rather than the popular tube and fabric for the type. The wings are similar to the Stolp Starduster. Roll rate is 240 degrees per second.
The wingspan is about . Both the fore wings and hind wings are composed of feather-like plumes. These are buff with brown marks. When resting, the moth sits with its abdomen curved up into the air and its wings held at right angles to the body with the plumes folded.
