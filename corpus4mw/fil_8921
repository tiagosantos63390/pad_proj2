They were so successful that at the same time that the Wellcome Trust established the Sanger Centre with Sulston at its head, Waterston received funding from the National Human Genome Research Institute to undertake large-scale human sequencing at his Washington University lab. The partnership became the first to complete the sequence of a multicellular organism when the worm genome was published in December 1998, and both labs played key roles in the sequencing of the human genome, with Waterstonâ€™s lab contributing more of the finished sequence than any other US lab. The partnership went on have leading roles in the sequencing of both the mouse and chimpanzee genomes.
