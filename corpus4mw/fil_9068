In 1973, the four home countries of the United Kingdom, namely Wales, Northern Ireland, England, and Scotland, were allowed for the first time to enter their own National Teams into the European ‘All Styles’ Championships, but could only continue to compete in World ‘All Styles’ Championships as part of a British Team. At this juncture, Hamish was appointed the Coach of Scottish National Karate Squad and the same year Scotland entered its first European Championships. The Team was not only coached by Hamish, but he also competed as one of its five fighters. They won the Gold Medal in the Team category, and repeated this achievement in 1984, and again in 1987, when the Team coached by Hamish won a further two team Gold Medals in the same prestigious European Championships. In addition he has coached two Scottish fighters who have attained the highest individual achievement in the sport of World ‘All Styles’ Karate Champion, namely Pat McKay in 1982 and again in 1984, and Jim Collins in 1984.
