Slowey is considered to be a control pitcher and his repertoire includes a low 90s fastball considered to be his best pitch, a good changeup, a good slow curveball, and a tight slider. He is known for his exceptional control and command of the strike zone and is often compared to former Minnesota Twins pitcher Brad Radke, due to his excellent control. Slowey's delivery is much simpler than Radke's, however, mainly due to the absence of Radke's high leg kick.
