About the Project.
“ART Frankfurt” (Germany)
German Youth Movement.
During Fontana’s pregnancy in Los Angeles she started her own jewellery design company “Chanson de Tangier,” which consisted solely of men’s and women’s beaded chokers. The designs were influenced by the style of her favourite fashion icon and musician, Brian Jones. The pieces were constructed of antique and vintage beads. Fontana would combine trade beads from Italy from the 1700s with sterling and African beads, some over 1,000 years old. The pieces were sold at top Los Angeles boutiques, including Lorenzo’s on Sunset Plaza Drive, the trendy Kitson on Robertson Boulevard, and many more shops from West Hollywood to Venice. Before her expat status she began creating art nouveau influenced pendants using black Czech Glass and Miriam Haskell beads from the 1920s.

At present, the GHQ-HSC serves as the Camp Administrator of Camp Aguinaldo and provides communication services, command & control services, and security for the higher echelons of the Philippine Military.
