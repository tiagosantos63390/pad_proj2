Fortrose Cathedral was the episcopal seat ("cathedra") of the medieval Scottish diocese of Ross. It is probable that the original site of the diocese was at Rosemarkie, but by the 13th century the canons had relocated a short distance to the south-west to the site known as Fortrose or Chanonry. According to Gervase of Canterbury, in the early 13th century the cathedral of Ross was manned by "Céli Dé" (culdees).

After the Navy discharged MacMitchell, he returned to competition in January 1946. Following third- and first-place finishes, respectively, in the Metropolitan AAU (indoor) and Grover Cleveland events, he made a successful comeback to the mile run, winning an event sponsored by "The Philadelphia Inquirer" in a time of 4:14.1. In February, he recorded a victory in the AAU national championship. MacMitchell had eight straight indoor victories in the mile, a streak ended with a second-place finish at the Chicago Relays, in which he fell during lap nine. Despite his wins, MacMitchell remained unsatisfied with his performance; he later attributed this to his military service, saying "Running on the steel deck of a light cruiser is not the best way to train." He later attempted to qualify for the 1948 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful; he retired from competition afterward.
