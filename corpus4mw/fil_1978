Returning to Japan, Prince Cuong found help from the Pan-Asian movement, including Toyama Mitsuru and was given a monthly allowance by his old friend Inukai Tsuyoshi. However, he was devastated by news of the arrest of Phan Boi Chau in Shanghai in 1925, followed by the assassination of Inukai in 1932. Prince Cuong founded the Phuc Quoc ("Restoration Party") in 1938, which also had an armed wing, as a monarchist alternative to the ("Association of Young Revolutionaries") movement created by Ho Chi Minh.

Interestingly enough, Hawk's final game with the Buckeyes was the 2006 Fiesta Bowl against Notre Dame, where Quinn was playing at the time.

Hawk managed to sack his future brother-in-law twice during the game and become co-MVP of the bowl which ended with an Ohio State victory.
