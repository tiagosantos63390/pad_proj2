In the 2009-10 season, the league grew to 7 teams, and the Underdogs were coached by Jay Armstead and Alan Hearn. Captained by Itamar Levin, Niv Medlinger, Roei Ziv, and Shahar Yeshurun, the Underdogs got off to a good start to the season with a 4-1 record good enough for first place midseason. Nevertheless, the Underdogs couldn't get another victory for the rest of the season, losing their final five regular season matches and the wild card game against the Judean Rebels.
