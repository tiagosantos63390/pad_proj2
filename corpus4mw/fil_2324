Wipo of Burgundy (also Wippo; c. 995 – c. 1048) was a priest and writer. He was a chaplain to the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, whose biography he wrote in chronicle form, "Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris". Present at the election of Conrad II, he most likely followed the emperor on his campaigns into Burgundy (1033) and against the Slavs (1035), both of which he wrote with extensive clarity.

To some the promotion was simply "Lucha Libre from El Toreo de Naucalpan", after the promotion's home base and a building Flores had promoted wrestling in for years before the split. El Toreo (a former bullring turned into an arena in 1968, now demolished and formerly located near Metro Cuatro Caminos station) became UWA's main venue, used for major title matches, their anniversary shows and significant "Lucha de Apuesta" (bet matches) matches. UWA's more relaxed approach to wrestling, combined with their willingness to promote younger wrestlers made the promotion a quick success as they drew repeated sell-out crowds at El Toreo. The promotion was the first to elevate wrestlers such as El Canek, Dos Caras, Fishman, Perro Aguayo and Villano III to main event status. El Canek became the "face of the UWA", holding the UWA World Heavyweight Championship no less than 13 times during the promotion's life span, drawing full houses when he "defended Mexico's honor" against foreign wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Tatsumi Fujinami or Big Van Vader.

Two reasons have been offered as to why, after Kim Il-sung's death, North Korea shifted to "songun" as a major ideology. One strand of the debate points to North Korea's desire to increase its military strength due to its precarious international position. In this sense, "songun" is perceived as an aggressive, threatening move to increase the strength of the North Korean military at the expense of other parts of society.
