Party System.
Hermenegild II ("floruit" 899–922) was an auxiliary bishop or coadjutor of the Diocese of Oviedo during the episcopates of Gomelo II, Flacinus, and Oveco. He was long mistaken for a senior bishop, as by Carlos González de Posada, who interposed his episcopate in that of Oveco for the years 915–22, and Manuel Risco, who placed it in 921–26. 
"Gocol" was named for its commander, Major R. E. S. Gooch. The column comprised B Squadron of the Household Cavalry Regiment, six Royal Air Force armoured cars, two 3.7 inch howitzers, and Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) transport.
