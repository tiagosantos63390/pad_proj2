The Okomu Forest Reserve is a forest block covering an area of 1081 km² in Edo State, about 50 km west of Benin City, Nigeria. The Okomu National Park lies within the reserve. The park holds a small part of the forests that once covered the region, and is the last habitat for many endangered species.

However, as referenced, Edward Twycross was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin on 18 October 1819 age 16; and is listed as the son of John, Aurarius ( goldsmith ); born in Dublin, graduating in 1824 Spring commencements with a B.A. Vern, and in 1832 as a Master of the Arts. The age links him to Edward’s Death certificate and the degree to the 1851 Census entry, both found in London, England. So, the three references refer to the same man. In the Admission Papers to King's Inn, Dublin is an entry "Twycross, Edward, 3rd son of John, Dublin jeweller and Sarah Clarke. Ed. York Street, Dublin". King's Inn, Dublin was an Inn of Court for lawyers. This accords well with his occupation as solicitor. York Street was in the parish of St Andrew’s, Dublin.
