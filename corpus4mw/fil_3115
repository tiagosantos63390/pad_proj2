In 1999, after several tours, Brian left the band and settled down. The band continued as a three-piece touring throughout the summer of 1999, and recorded their second album, "Madison Road", as a trio. While touring to support the album, Jason Roach joined as the new rhythm guitarist. Shortly afterwards, Larry Rox quit, and "The Name" joined to play keyboards for the group. After a few months, "The Name" left the band. Mitchell Gooden joined as the band's new rhythm guitarist, and the band began touring again. Around this time, Hero met his wife on a Rockers tour at a show in Mississippi, and they now perform together under the name Justin Hero.

Vicente López was a Neo-classicist painter but he retained certain traces of the Rococo style. He had the Neo-classical emphasis on masterly drawing, though with less rigidity. López is considered the best Spanish painter of his time, second only to Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes. One of his rivals was Agustín Esteve Marqués.
The tight development schedules associated with most new automotive, aerospace and defense programs do not allow embedded system testing to wait for a prototype to be available. In fact, most new development schedules assume that HIL simulation will be used in parallel with the development of the plant. For example, by the time a new automobile engine prototype is made available for control system testing, 95% of the engine controller testing will have been completed using HIL simulation.
