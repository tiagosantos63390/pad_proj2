After performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of laxative, forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his "centipede". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim’s car and births her child, which is clearly shown, who then gets onto the road. As the engine starts, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal but still manages to escape.

There were various artistic movements and their proponents in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that took an interest in the enrichment of book design and illustration. For example, Aubrey Beardsley, an proponent of both Art Nouveau and Aestheticism, had a great influence over book illustrations. Beardsley specialized in erotica and some of the best examples of his drawings were for the first English edition of Oscar Wilde's Salomé (1894).
