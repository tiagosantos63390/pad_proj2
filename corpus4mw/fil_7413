The Suzuki Fronte 800 was a 2-stroke subcompact car built by the Suzuki Motor Corporation in the latter half of the 1960s.

The first new wing in the late 1950s was built along the railway line with a new assembly hall and stage. The new science lab was in this building.
Olivares was well known for his passion for work. Early on, Olivares would rise early, go to confession, wake Philip IV and discuss the day's events with him, before then working throughout the rest of the day, often until 11 o'clock at night. Initially, Olivares would meet with him three times a day, although this declined over time until he met with the king only once a day. Whilst living a private life of 'spartan austerity' himself, Olivares was skillful in using the formal and elaborate protocol of the court as a way of controlling the ambitions of Philip's enemies and rivals. Determined to attempt to improve the bureaucratic Castilian system of government, during the 1620s Olivares began to create "juntas", smaller governmental committees, to increase the speed of decision making. By the 1630s, these were increasingly packed with Olivares' own placemen, tasked to implement his policies. Olivares placed tight controls on the use of special royal favours to circumvent tight spending controls. The result was a very particular combination of centralised power in the form of Olivares, and loose government executed by small committees.
