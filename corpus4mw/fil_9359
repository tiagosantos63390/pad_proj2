By the Permian period the sea had left completely. Local bodies of water were then lakes and rivers rather than saltwater. Southeastern Ohio was a swamp-covered coastal plain. Ferns and horsetails were among the state's rich flora. Ohio was only about 5 degrees north of the equator. Sand and mud deposited on local river deltas gradually filled in the swamp. Later in the Permian Ohio was subjected to geologic uplift and its sediments were eroded away. Permian fossils aren't especially common in Ohio, but include snails, clams, fishes, plants, amphibians, and reptiles. Marine fossils from this period are rare.
