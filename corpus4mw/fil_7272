The "Tempest Pack" downloadable content received high praise from critics. In its first week of release, the "Tempest Pack" sold over 5,300 copies. Jim Cook of Gamers Daily News gave the pack an 8/10. He praised the new course design, stating it was a major draw for "Hurricane" players. He also gave high marks to the game's two new boats, as well as the addition of refitted Expert class versions of the game's Novice and Pro boats. Cook was critical of the high unlock points of these boats, stating that " may take a while to unlock unless you’ve been very active with the game." John Laster of XBLAfans gave the "Tempest Pack" a "Buy" rating and called the content a great value for fans of the game. He also felt the courses were exceptional, stating they were "on par, if not better than the tracks released with the game." He stated that the two new boats were well matched with the other expert boats, and that the upgraded Expert versions of the Novice and Pro boats were "a necessity and something we wish had been included in the original game."

Stephen Thomas Erlewine with Allmusic gave it four stars, and said it wasn't a traditional bluegrass album, saying "The very presence of a U2 song suggests that this is not a traditional bluegrass album, either in its content -- or in its approach, as he sometimes puts picking in the backseat, letting the instruments strum sweetly as he croons." Wade Jessen with "Billboard" called it "a thrilling ride from start to finish" and called the track "Down in the Mine" "the standout track".
