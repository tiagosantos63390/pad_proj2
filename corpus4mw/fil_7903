In September 1862 Stokoe joined the staff of the newly founded Clifton College in Bristol, becoming the first schoolmaster recorded in the school register. He left Clifton in 1863, having served for a year as second master, the equivalent of deputy headmaster.
The heroine of Sampson's early books was Robin Ballantyne, a British TV journalist working for "the Corporation" (possibly a veiled reference to the BBC, for which Sampson herself had once worked, and which was also her husband's employer during the 1980s and 90s). In "Falling Off Air" (2004), Ballantyne witnesses the death of a celebrity neighbour and gradually discovers how it mysteriously relates to her own professional and private world. In "Out of Mind" (2005), Ballantyne goes in search of a missing camerawoman, and becomes embroiled in "Corporation" intrigues. Ballantyne is less central to the action in Sampson's third novel, "The Pool of Unease" (2007), in which she shares the main role with Song Ren, a private detective. Both are trying to unravel the murder of a British man in Beijing. In the fourth novel, "The Slaughter Pavilion" (2008), Ballantyne is mentioned only briefly and Song becomes the protagonist. His investigations explore the gritty and lawless world of rural China.
