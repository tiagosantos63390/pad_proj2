In order to better understand the growth kinetics associated with CBE, it is important to look at physical and chemical processes associated with MBE and MOCVD as well. Figure 2 depicts those. The growth kinetics for these three techniques differ in many ways. In conventional gas source MBE, the growth rate is determined by the arrival rate of the group III atomic beams. The epitaxial growth takes place as the group III atoms impinge on the heated substrate surface, migrates into the appropriate lattice sites and then deposits near excess group V dimers or tetramers. It is worth noting that no chemical reaction is involved at the surface since the atoms are generated by thermal evaporation from solid elemental sources.
His twin brother, Vernon, also played first-class cricket for Victoria.

On 23 March 1972 she married Zbigniew Tucholski. Their son, Zbigniew, was born on 27 November 1975. 
Sievers began his career in 1930 for the Colts, at 17 years of age. Sievers was a useful right-handed lower order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Victoria in the seasons leading up to the Second World War. He made a lot of useful 50s for the state team, but his bowling was inclined to be expensive.
