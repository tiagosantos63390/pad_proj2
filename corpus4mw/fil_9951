Reyes’ career has spanned over five decades, and he is best known for his printmaking. Much of that career is tied with his studio Taller Libre de Grabado Mario Reyes, founded in 1965. The workshop produced more than one thousands works of art during its forty five years of production. This production has since been cataloged and published in book and interactive CD form under the title of "Taller Libre de Grabado Mario Reyes". Reyes did work such as the production of books and other publications for artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, Francisco Toledo, Rodolfo Nieto, Francisco Corzas, José Luis Cuevas and others.
