The white shell is ovate.Its length measures 2.8 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are somewhat inflated, constricted at the sutures and feebly shouldered at the summits. They are marked by four equal well incised, spiral lines between the sutures and numerous very retractive lines of growth, with a few feeble indications of axial ribs, at and near the summit, which renders the first and sometimes the second space between the incised lines below the summit feebly nodulous. The sutures are strongly impressed. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are somewhat inflated, well rounded, and marked by seven incised spiral lines, which decrease regularly in spacing from the periphery to the umbilical area. The aperture is broadly oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is quite strong, strongly curved, provided with a strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.

NerdaCon is a multi-genre fan convention (first seen as a "gaming, popular arts, and crafts convention") held annually since 2007 at Columbus State University by the school's "Campus Nerds" group, a campus organization that describes itself as "an organization that embraces all special interests and gives its members a community of like minded invidiviuals". Each year, the con is titled "NerdaCon vX", where "X" is the number of the con (The first was "v1", the second was "v2", etc.). As it is a multi-genre convention, it has no general focus other than that of the Nerds, in that the panels, guests, and dealers each add a focus toward anime, manga, science fiction, gaming, comic books, zombie apocalypse, or a combination of these or other generally nerdy or geeky things to add to the atmosphere. Also unlike other conventions, admission to NerdaCon is free, and, as it is hosted on an open campus, parking for the convention is, as well. Instead, the convention makes its money through donations, in-con sales, et cetera. However, the Campus Nerds do not keep all the money; much of it is donated to such organizations as Children's Miracle Network and the Hero Initiative.

The SSSI encompasses the entirety of the tidal regions of the Tamar; from Gunnislake down to the Tamar Bridge in the south, where it forms the Hamoaze, and the River Tavy from Lopwell to its discharge in the Tamar.

The position of the output, measured by the potentiometer, is continually compared to the commanded position from the control (i.e., the radio control). Any difference gives rise to an error signal in the appropriate direction, which drives the electric motor either forwards or backwards, and moving the output shaft to the commanded position. When the servo reaches this position, the error signal reduces and then becomes zero, at which point the servo stops moving.

The Military Road School was established in 1864 to educate free-people of color. The site was formerly occupied by the barracks of Fort Stevens and was located on what was then Military Road, which connected Washington’s Civil War forts. Many freedmen and women settled near forts for protection and employment. It was one of the first schools in Washington to open after Congress authorized the education of African Americans. The students who attended school came from the neighborhood, traveled from other parts of upper Northwest Washington as well as from Montgomery County, Maryland. The school remained open until 1954 when the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision desegregated public schools in the United States.

In South Africa Van Wyk continued working on his "Kersfees Kantata" (Christmas Cantata), a work he had begun composing in London that promised him financial security with yearly state-sponsored broadcasts. To avoid any further connections with the Afrikaner Nationalists, Van Wyk accepted an appointment as lecturer in Music at the English-speaking University of Cape Town, a post that "promised security while allowing some time for composition and piano playing". He completed his Second Symphony (Sinfonia Ricercata) during this time, a work commissioned for the 1952 Van Riebeeck Festival, as well as his orchestral work "Rapsodie" (1951).

After the events of "The Scorch Trials", protagonist Thomas is held in solitary confinement, but is eventually released. He, along with some others, soon learns from Assistant Director Janson that the claim of a cure for the Flare (a deadly disease) was a lie. However, while many of the people present are immune, not all are, and many in the outside world despise the immune. The Gladers are offered the chance to restore their memories, and it is also revealed that the controlling device in their brains will be removed in the process. This means that Thomas, Teresa, and Aris will no longer be able to communicate telepathically. Most accept the procedure except Thomas, Minho, and Newt, who are later forced into the process but escape with the help of Brenda. It is revealed that Newt is not immune to the Flare.
