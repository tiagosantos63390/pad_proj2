Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann regarded both "Hard Times" and "Summer's Here" among the better songs on "Dad Loves His Work", helping Taylor bounce back from his previous "spotty" album "Flag". "Musician, Player, and Listener" described it as sounding "more personal - especially as regards marital problems - than anything committed to wax in years." Web critic David Bertrand Wilson called it a "charming low-key tune." "Michigan Daily" critic Ari Roth stated that "Hard Times" "assert[s a dependency and will to achievement that Taylor has never previously articulated." Michael Hochandel of "Schenectady Gazette" reported that "Hard Times" received as much applause in 1981 live performaces as Taylor's classics.

100 Cult Films is a 2011 book written by Ernest Mathijs and Xavier Mendik, who selected one hundred cult films to discuss. The two authors often disagreed with each other and were forced to make concessions; for example, Mathijs opposed the inclusion of "Cannibal Holocaust", which he called an initiation ritual and not a film with a devoted cult following. He relented and allowed its inclusion so that he could convince Mendik to include "Begotten". Mathijs wanted to include "The Princess Bride", but Mendik wanted to focus on including more transgressive films, and it was not included. As a result of its necessarily arbitrary choices, the book attracted controversy from cult film fans. In order to choose the final film, the authors performed a public survey; the resulting winner was "In Bruges". A mobile app was released to allow readers to mark each of the films that they've seen. The app features appearances by Eli Roth and Joe Dante.
