In September 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard published its final investigative report on the accident. In essence, that report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident. The report consists of two volumes. Volume I contains the report of the US Coast Guard. That volume states that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its Deepwater Horizon crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster.

Los Mazatlecos gang were formed in the coastal city of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, from where they take their name. Initially, the gang was at the service of the drug lord Alfredo Beltrán Leyva ("El Mochomo") until he was arrested by the Mexican authorities in 2008. After his arrest, Los Mazatlecos shifted their alliance to Alfredo's brother Héctor Beltrán Leyva, the current leader of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. The group is one of the largest gangs working for the cartel's criminal umbrella.

The 1984-85 French Rugby Union Championship was won by Toulose that beat Toulon in the final.
The Patriots first loss of the season came in Cincinnati, as the Patriots struggled to gain any offense against a great Bengals defense. Brady's consecutive games with a TD pass streak ended at 52, two games short of Drew Brees' record, against the same team which he had started the streak in 2010. From start to finish the Bengals defensive line led by Geno Atkins made mince meat of the Patriots offensive line. Brady was hit and sacked early and often on the day. Both teams' defenses played extremely well in the day. On the Patriots final drive, Brady led the Pats to the Cincinnati 27 yard line before throwing a final fade in a gargantuan downpour. The ball was wet, wobbly, inaccurate, and intercepted. 
With the win, the Broncos improved to 8–1.
