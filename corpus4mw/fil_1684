One of the main features of gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join the player character (Blake) throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair fuse boxes, which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, are better shots than engineers or medics, and are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. Blake can issue basic commands to each member of the team, such as ordering them to follow him, ordering them remain where they are, ordering them to give him their weapon, and, in the case of engineers, ordering them to fix a fuse box.

The Treasurer, in the throne room, tells the player the fund reserve in his or her castle treasury. Development of new equipment and spells, and establishment of services in Avalon will consume funds. The Treasurer also fills the Emperor with walking about funds if the player needs it. Also in the throne room is the Accountant. He tells the player how much money he or she collects per battle. When the player controls more land on the map, the amount increases. In the southeast corner of the throne room is the Chancellor. He tells the player what problems need to be solved in the world and where to solve them. Solving the problems he points out aids the player to advance to the next generation. The Fighters are the default characters that join the player early in the game. They are not the best characters, but as the player advances through the game, he or she will get other characters who specialize in areas that the Fighters are weak in. The Formation Soldiers demonstrate any battle formations the player happens to know and will collaborate with the player to make new formations. If the heir the player chooses knows a formation, it is recommended that the player consult the Formation Soldiers.
The area of Sarno was inhabited since Neolithic times, and in pre-historical times housed Oscan and Samnites settlements. Later it was acquired by the Romans, who held it until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD.

In 1985, Endino and Daniel House started the influential grunge band Skin Yard. Though originally a drummer, Endino played guitar and Matt Cameron played drums until he left for Soundgarden. In 1986, Skin Yard contributed two songs to C/Z Records' legendary grunge compilation "Deep Six". In July 1986, Endino left his basement recording studio to found Reciprocal Recording with Chris Hanzsek, the "Deep Six" sound engineer, where he used his self-taught recording skills to produce, engineer, and mix Skin Yard's 1987 debut album "Skin Yard". His skill and low fees meant that he was soon an engineer of choice for up-and-coming Seattle grunge bands, and in 1988, he recorded Nirvana's debut album "Bleach" in a mere 30 hours for $606.17, using a rather primitive reel-to-reel 8-track machine. The album did well in the underground, and after the success of 1991's "Nevermind" it went platinum. After Reciprocal Recording closed in July 1991, Endino continued as a freelance producer and engineer, producing several albums including Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks. He appeared in the 1996 grunge documentary Hype!, where he's humorously referred to as "the godfather of grunge." Endino was also interviewed at length for the 2009 book, 'Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music' [http://www.ecwpress.com/book/grunge-dead].
