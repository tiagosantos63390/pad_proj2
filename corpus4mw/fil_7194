Crichton strongly supported the Barry M. Goldwater presidential candidacy: "In my opinion Goldwater would have made a great president. He would either have withdrawn our presence in Vietnam or gone whole hog to win it, instead of the piecemeal strategy of the Johnson administration that so hampered our military leaders as they in effect were not allowed to win the Vietnam conflict."

Plot.
In order to accommodate the purchasers of American Publishing Company's uniform editions (issued from 1899–1903), Harper and Brothers bound Volume 24 to match the previous bindings of the earlier editions. Each volume for previous American Publishing Company customers contained the following statement: "This edition is printed by Harper & Brothers, the exclusive publishers of Mark Twain's works, as an accommodation to purchasers of earlier volumes with a view to making their sets uniform". It was up to the former buyers of the American Publishing uniform editions to continue adding volumes to their sets. However, a number of buyers stopped collecting the books. Any set found now that contains more than twenty-two volumes from American Publishing Company is considered rare.
During Friday afternoon's qualifying session, forty-six cars were entered, but only the fastest forty-three were able to enter the race. Kurt Busch clinched his second pole position of 2010, with a time of 37.898 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jamie McMurray. Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne shared the second row in the third and fourth position, while Jeff Burton, with a time of 38.00 seconds, qualified fifth. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Dave Blaney, Michael Waltrip and Johnny Sauter.
Johnson's lead—13 seconds over Truex, Jr. by lap 54—was reduced to nothing when the safety car was deployed on the fifty-eighth lap. Dave Blaney had spun out and his car stopped in the middle of the track. After pit stops were completed, the top five positions were filled by Boris Said in first, Stewart in second, Ambrose in third, Ekström in fourth, and David Ragan in fifth. Said made a good restart, but because of his older tires, Ambrose passed him. One lap later, Johnson had all ready passed four cars and was in the third position when Truex Jr. spun going through turn eleven. The third caution flag was waved because Brad Keselowski turned sideways at turn ten; he had major damage to the splitter from going through the dirt off the track. Said made a slow restart, making cars collide with each other, prompting a red flag on lap 67.
