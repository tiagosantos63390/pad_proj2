2009 - Tallman Volunteer Fire Department (TVFD) celebrates its 100 anniversary. The TVFD organized in 1909 as a bucket brigade. The first horse-drawn piece of equipment came in 1910 and not until the mid-1920s did they use motor vehicles. Today the company uses high-tech engine, ladder and rescue equipment. The Department now has about 60 active members, a ladies auxiliary and a junior firefighters program for teens. W. H. "Jiggy" Brucker, who has served the department since 1938 and still responds to almost every daytime call, says "It's a 70-year-old habit".
Much of the land is composed of soft mudstones, that are easily eroded, particularly in areas without bush cover.
