Le Chant du monde is the oldest French record label and music publishing house in activity. It has been created in 1938 by Léon Moussinac and has been supported in the beginning by such allied as classical composers Georges Auric, Arthur Honegger, Charles Kœchlin, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Albert Roussel, and such conductors as Roger Désormière and Manuel Rosenthal.

Macrae enlisted the support of the king of the island and engaged the pirates once more. But injured in his head and with a price upon him set by Edward England, Macrae was forced to escape. Ten days later, however, Macrae surrendered to England and after a heated debate on his fate, the pirates finally pardoned him (which incidentally sealed the fate of England) and left the island on September 3, 1720. Macrae, himself, left five days later arriving at Bombay on October 26, 1720.
