Laurie becomes able to astrally project. Meanwhile, people close to her start to have accidents. When Laurie, via the astral projection, finds out that Lia is in a mental hospital after having killed her last foster parents' daughter, she knows Lia is responsible for her friends' accidents. She then finds herself unable to return to her body; hovering over it she sees it rise and walk, and realizes that Lia's soul is inside it. She must then figure out how to get Lia out of her body so she can return to it.
