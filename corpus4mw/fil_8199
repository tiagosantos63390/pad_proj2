Colla belonged to the Parmesan merchant class. In 1599, her royal lover Farnese married Margherita Aldobrandini. After a decade of childless marriage, Farnese accused Claudia Colla and her mother Elena for having caused the lack of offspring by the use of sorcery. The accusation of sorcery was unusual for someone of her class. She was judged guilty and sentenced to be executed by burning.
Pollard began her career by collaborating with other Detroit musicians, such as Billy Mitchell (and Elvin Jones, in the house band at the Blue Bird Inn), Johnny Hill, and the Emmitt Slay Trio. She was discovered by Terry Gibbs and toured with him in the early 1950s, playing piano and vibraphone. She recorded an album with him, "Terry Gibbs Quartet - Featuring Terry Pollard". Pollard appeared with Gibbs on an episode of "The Tonight Show" hosted by Steve Allen. Her collaborations with Gibbs from 1953 to 1957 marked the height of her career.

On the front-side of the chassis there is a small hidden LCD screen with 3 buttons: one 4 way directional button allowing one to navigate through the menus on the screen and two "on/off" push buttons which work as an "OK" or "Escape" button. The screen can be used to check the status of the enclosure and the modules in it: you can for example check active alarms on the system, get the IP address of the CMC of KVM, check the system-names etc. Especially for an environment where there are more enclosures in one datacenter it can be useful to check if you are working on the correct enclosure. Unlike the rack or tower-servers there are only a very limited set of indicators on individual servers: a blade server has a power-led and (local) disc-activity led's but no LCD display offering you any alarms, hostnames etc. Nor are there LED's for I/O activity: this is all combined in this little screen giving you information on both the enclosure as well as information over the inserted servers, switches, fans, power-supplies etc.
