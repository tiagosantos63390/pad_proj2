The Southern Synod administers Gomshall United Reformed Church; the Wessex Synod is responsible for Guildford (Portsmouth Road and Westborough), Normandy and Worplesdon churches. The Anglican/United Reformed shared church of St Peter's on the Bellfields estate in Guildford is also part of the Wessex Synod.
In 1900, after his son died at Carlisle, Wheelock resigned his post to move his career elsewhere. He worked as a newspaperman in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and then a disciplinarian at the U.S. Indian School at Flandreau, South Dakota. Wheelock performed as guest bandmaster at Willow Grove Park, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This premier venue featured Sousa and his band at the music pavilion every year but one between 1901 and 1926. On one occasion, Wheelock drew 70,000 people to a concert. He was later awarded a gold medal and a silver cup for his brilliant conducting.
