Medwin had also embarked on what may be regarded as his finest achievements, the translations of Aeschylus's plays into English. It was a prodigious piece of work with "Prometheus Unbound" and "Agamemon" appearing in companion volumes in May 1833, followed by "The Seven Tribes Against Thebes, The Persians, The Eumenides" and "The Choephori". He did not translate "The Suppliants", apparently because he disapproved of "its corruptions". The translations were enthusiastically reviewed by important literary magazines, including The Gentleman's Magazine, and published in Fraser's Magazine but there was some criticism that he had strayed from the original meaning, which Medwin had intentionally done when he felt the occasion demanded. Medwin's skill lay in bringing alive Aeschylus's characters through believable dialogue that uses traditional metres and measure.

Career.
The two teams have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970, the lone exception being 1982, when the annual matchup in Cincinnati was canceled due to the player's strike; the teams only met in Week 2 in Pittsburgh that season just before the start of the strike. Originally placed in the AFC Central following the AFL–NFL merger, the two teams currently compete in that division's successor, the AFC North.
The puppets or marionettes are made of wood, silk and brocade or embroidered cloth. They are operated by strings and push rods from within the yatai. “Karakuri (mechanical) puppet plays performed on a stage are superb”. The puppets like the Yatai represent the skilled craftsmen of the area. The puppets or The three marionettes “on Hotei Tai (the god of fortune)” require 9 puppet masters to manipulate the 36 strings which make the marionettes move in a lifelike manner, with gestures, turns and other movements. A problem with the puppets are parts needed to repair the puppets. The springs in the puppets are made of Right whale baleen and cannot be replaced with steel springs or the baleen of other whales. Other materials used to make the springs cannot duplicate the movements of the springs made with Right whale baleen.

The Catholic Church's response to the scandal can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at all three levels in parallel with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. The United States' National Conference of Bishops passed a "zero tolerance" policy in June 2002.

In Cantonese, Aberdeen is known indigenously as Hong Kong Tsai (香港仔), which means Hong Kong Minor, Son of Hong Kong or Little Hong Kong. It is believed that Aberdeen is where the name of Hong Kong (more accurate transcription, Heung Kong) originates. Heung Kong Tsuen (香港村, Hong Kong village) on Ap Lei Chau was mentioned in Ming maps. Another walled-village Heung Kong Wai in Wong Chuk Hang was also founded during Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. Hong Kong means 'fragrant harbour' and it was Aberdeen where incense trees (aquilaria sinensis) from the New Territories used to be transferred for export to other cities in China. One alternative Chinese name was 'Shek Pai Wan' (石排灣).
The language Volapük itself quickly acquired support since it had appeared, both in Europe and America. There were three international congresses: the first was in 1884 in Friedrichshafen, the second in 1887 in Munich and the third in 1889 in Paris. By 1889 there were 316 textbooks available in 25 languages, 283 clubs and around 25 magazines. In 1887 the American Philosophical Society established a commission for the evaluation of the scientific value of Volapük. It can be said that at the end of the 19th century there were nearly a million volapükists in the world.
Poteria fasciatum is a species of tropical land snail with gills and an operculum, a terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Neocyclotidae.
Christian pilgrims wrote of their visits to see the house and church of Mary Magdalene from the 6th century onward, but little is known about the village in the Mamluk and early Ottoman period, indicating it was likely small or uninhabited. In the 19th century, Western travellers interested in the biblical history of Palestine documented their observations of Al-Majdal, generally describing it as a very small and poor Muslim village. In 1910-11, Russian Zionists founded Migdal adjacent to Al-Majdal. Just prior to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Al-Majdal was depopulated and then largely destroyed. The Israeli town of Migdal has since expanded onto part of the village's former lands.
The young Ismail began playing football using tennis balls which he got from a neighbour in Al-Karkh who was working with the British before he started school. It was at Dar Al-Mualamin Primary in Al-Karkh where he was taught by Egyptian PE teacher Safwat Al-Ameiri. One of his fellow students was Abdul-Ghani Askar, who Ismail still says possesses the strongest shot that he has seen to this day. Ismail played in several school tournaments involving other schools from Baghdad; one game was against the Al-Tahera Primary, where one of Baghdad’s best players Nassir “Chico” Yousef was studying. 
In January 2014, he was named in the England starting XV for the 2014 Six Nations Championship opening game away to France on 1 February, where he scored his first international try in a 26-24 defeat, running onto a pass to go over and score under the posts.

Charles R. Spencer (generally called the "Spencer") was a steamboat built in 1901 to run on the Willamette and Columbia rivers from Portland, to The Dalles, Oregon. This vessel was described as an "elegant passenger boat".

Meanwhile on 29 January D Company, 7 RAR contacted a battalion concentrating in bunkers during a two and half hour battle that saw nine Australian casualties, including one killed, while seven Viet Cong were also killed. On 31 January Viet Cong overran the village of Trang Bom, just south-west of FSB Andersen. The Australians reclaimed it that afternoon only for the communists to attack again the next day. Once again the Australians recaptured it, this time in savage house-to-house fighting involving D Company, 2 RAR/NZ and A Squadron, 3 CAV. C Company, 3 RAR was subsequently inserted to assist with the protection of FSB Harrison. In response to the attack on Trang Bom, D Company, 7 RAR was dispatched forward to search the area. The lead platoon advanced on a Viet Cong camp—later found to be battalion-size—and was almost destroyed in the ensuing fire-fight. With half the platoon soon becoming casualties, another platoon was moved forward to aid their extraction. Close support from artillery protected the Australians from further casualties however, and the Viet Cong was eventually forced to withdraw. Six Australians had been killed and 36 wounded in the engagements up to that point, while one New Zealander had also died and one wounded. More than 40 Viet Cong had been killed and nine wounded.
