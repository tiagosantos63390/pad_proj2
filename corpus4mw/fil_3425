Days of working time in Israel are Sunday through Thursday (for a five-day workweek), or Friday (for a six-day workweek). In observance of "Shabbat", in places where Friday is a work day and the majority of population is Jewish, Friday is a "short day", usually lasting till 14:00 in the winter, or 16:00 in the summer. Several proposals have been raised to adjust the work week with the majority of the world, and make Sunday a non-working day, while extending working time of other days, and/or replacing Friday with Sunday as a work day.
Various media outlets initially characterised the issue as 'girlish rivalry' but later blamed it on bullying and racism. As time progressed, the majority of media coverage of Jade became negative, although accusations of racism were superseded by those of bullying. An editorial published by "The Daily Mirror" on 18 January 2007 called 'Beauty v Bigot', deplored what they referred to as "disgraceful racist bullying of "Big Brother"'s Shilpa Shetty", and criticised Channel 4 management for maintaining that there was not a racial element to the bullying. The British tabloids mostly concentrated on the comments made by Jade, rather than those made by Jack, Danielle and Jo and the bullying from them. For instance, when Jade and Shilpa were arguing over Oxo cubes, Shilpa pleaded with Jo for assistance by saying "Jo, I mean, are you going to say something here what is happening here?" - to which Jo responded by bursting out laughing. Jermaine Jackson, another housemate witnessing the situation, later said, "When all this was going on I saw Danielle and Jo laughing and then branded them as 'the allies'".

The Liberals suffered the double indignity of losing the seat contested by their leader Bruce McDonald to an independent, and of being reduced to the same number of seats in parliament as their ostensible junior coalition partner. In fact it was the second election in a row in which the sitting Liberal leader had failed to be elected to Parliament after Peter Coleman in 1978.

However, Kanakuri is best known for disappearing during the marathon race in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. The race was held at Sollentuna Municipality, in Sweden, in unexpected 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) heat, and over half of the runners in the event suffered from hyperthermia. Kanakuri, weakened by the long journey from Japan, and suffering from problems with the local food, lost consciousness midway through the race, and was cared for by a farming family. He returned to Japan without notifying race officials. Swedish authorities considered him missing for 50 years before discovering that he was living in Japan and had competed in intervening Olympic marathons. In 1966, he was contacted by Swedish Television and offered the opportunity to complete his run. He accepted and completed the marathon in 54 years, 8 months, 6 days, 5 hours, 32 minutes and 20.379 seconds, remarking, "It was a long trip. Along the way, I got married, had six children and 10 grandchildren."
