Subitizing concerns the ability to instantly identify the number of items without counting. Collections of four or below are usually subitised with collections of larger numbers being counted. Brian Butterworth designed an experiment that ran as an interactive exhibit at the Explore-At-Bristol science museum to find whether subitising differed between women and men. Participants were asked to estimate as fast as they could between one and 10 dots and press the answer on a touch screen. How long they took—their reaction time—was measured. Over 18,000 people took part—the largest number ever to take part in a mathematical cognition experiment. He announced his finding that women were better than men at subitising at the British Association for the Advancement of Science's 2003 annual science festival. He also found that people were six per cent faster on calculating the number of dots if they were presented on the left side of the screen (and so right sided lateralised in the brain) but only if there were five or more and so counted.

Once opposition had ceased Basil showed considerable statesmanship in his dealings with the Bulgarians. He wisely accepted Bulgarian taxes in kind rather than in coinage, as a full monetary economy was not established in Bulgaria. Many of the Bulgarian elite were integrated into Byzantine society, being given military or civil positions within the Byzantine state. This integration is illustrated by the last Bulgarian tsar Ivan Vladislav being an ancestor of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.

Taub shows House the MRI results and says there is no tumor in the brain, so Thirteen suggests a biopsy. Amber tells House to do a comparison of slides from when Seth broke his nose years ago. House goes into Wilson's office while Wilson's talking to Chase about the bachelor party House is planning for him. House has the two MRIs with him, and shows them to Wilson, who confirms that there is evidence of NF2 in the scans and that a brain biopsy is needed. House and Amber watch the biopsy from the gallery. Chase tells House that the biopsy shows nerve inflammation, not cancer. Amber pushes House to have Chase insert a cochlear implant into Seth, which causes him to freak out once he discovers it. His mother demands the removal of the implant. As a result, Foreman now leads the group, and the team discusses Seth's post-operation fever. Taub wonders if Seth's (deaf) girlfriend gave him the Epstein-Barr virus. Foreman has the team treat the virus with ribavirin.

Calder’s design for "La Grande Vitesse" was consistent with other monumental sculptures he was commissioned to create during this period in his career.

The sculpture is a popular gathering place for residents and tourists alike, and it is the centerpiece of the city’s annual Festival of the Arts.
