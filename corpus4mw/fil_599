Roach appeared as several burly villains in the Indiana Jones series in the 1980s. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Roach played two roles. He first played the Giant Sherpa who fights Jones in the bar in Nepal, and later played the shaven-headed German mechanic who eagerly boxes with Indiana Jones before being killed by propeller blades on the airstrip in Egypt. Thus, he is killed twice in the film. In the next film, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", Roach plays the gigantic Thuggee overseer who fights with Jones before being pulled in to a rock crusher. His final appearance in the series was as a Gestapo officer in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"; however, he appears only briefly, because his main fight scene with Jones was cut. The physically imposing Colonel Dovchenko in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008) was a character very much in the tradition of Roach's "Indiana Jones" characters from the original three films.

The low solubility of most polymers presents challenges. Some researchers have addressed this through the formation of nanostructures and surfactant-stabilized conducting polymer dispersions in water. These include polyaniline nanofibers and PEDOT:PSS. These materials have lower molecular weights than that of some materials previously explored in the literature. However, in some cases, the molecular weight need not be high to achieve the desired properties.

PPV is a diamagnetic material and has a very low intrinsic electrical conductivity, on the order of 10-13 S/cm.The electrical conductivity increases upon doping with iodine, ferric chloride, alkali metals, or acids. However, the stability of these doped materials is relatively low. In general, unaligned, unsubstituted PPV presents only moderate conductivity with doping, ranging from «10-3 S/cm (I2 doped) to 100 S/cm (H2SO4-doped).[1 Draw ratios of up to 10 are possible. Alkoxy-substituted PPVs are generally easier to oxidize than the parent PPV and hence have much higher conductivities. Longer side chains lower the conductivity and hinder interchain hopping of charge carriers.

The three remaining districts continued to be used for a number of decades, but as control over the territory was moved from departments of the federal government to a centralized government in Yellowknife starting in 1967, they began to have far less use. Although the Districts of Franklin, Mackenzie and Keewatin continued to appear on many maps (and were technically still extant), by the 1980s the actual practical governance of the Northwest Territories was divided into four administrative regions: Inuvik, Fort Smith, Keewatin and Baffin. A fifth region, the Central Arctic Region and subsequently called the Kitikmeot, was later carved out of the Fort Smith Region.

Twenty-eight years later, in 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire. Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman), a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate. He and his crew, Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler (Kevin Spacey), and new recruit Major Salt (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) gain information about the virus and return to the United States, where Daniels asks his superior, now-Brigadier General William Ford, to put out an alert. Ford knows that the virus is not new, but he tells Daniels it is unlikely to show up. Meanwhile, one of the host animals, a white-headed capuchin monkey named Betsy, is illegally brought to the United States. James "Jimbo" Scott (Patrick Dempsey), an employee at the Biotest animal holding facility, steals Betsy and takes her to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market. During the trip, Jimbo is infected with the virus.

Salary review controversy.
In game one of round five, every game ended in a win for white. Top seeds Topalov (who had won every game apart from one draw going into this round) and Adams won as expected, but the other two wins were slight upsets. Radjabov lost to Dominguez after a complicated opening after which white emerged with three connected passed pawns for a bishop, and Grischuk lost to Kasimdzhanov in an exchange Ruy Lopez. In the position shown in the diagram, which appears to be better for Black, Grischuk slipped up with 46. ... Bc2? allowing 47. Ne6+. This forks the king and bishop on c5, so 47. ... Rxe6 is forced, but this deflects the rook from defence of d7, allowing 48. R3d7+ Kb6 49. Rb8+, a skewer which picks up the rook on b2. Grischuk fought on before resigning on move 73. The match Radjabov-Dominguez ended 3½–3½ with Radjabov only advancing by virtue of drawing with black in the final Armageddon tie-breaker.

Since the end of the Civil War, the United States had experienced panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions—the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during both the 1884 and the 1890 panics. A bank crisis in 1896, in which there was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.
Thanks to the oil sector, commercial activity was developed. A big number of foreign people, and from other provinces of Argentina, moved to the city to set up their shops. For this reason Comodoro Rivadavia is considered one of the cities with the highest rate of consumption. This has helped different businesses to develop. This progress is reflected in the downtown: there is a lot of commercial activity, different options in entertainment, restaurants and very busy four-star hotels.
"Kangaroo" and "Holocaust" were both covered by This Mortal Coil on the band's debut LP, "It'll End in Tears".

"Holocaust" was also covered by Placebo on the band's single for "Slave to the Wage" in 2000 and can also be found on their compilation "Covers". "Take Care" was covered by Yo La Tengo on "Summer Sun". "Kangaroo" was released by Jeff Buckley on his posthumous live album Mystery White Boy; another version can be found on the legacy edition of his album Grace.

In the three issue miniseries "Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey" (1994), Superman journeys to Apokolips and Calaton to find Doomsday's body. Assisted by Waverider, he confronts Darkseid and Hank Henshaw, finds that his killer is still alive, and discovers the details of Doomsday's origin as a genetically-engineered life-form created by the Kryptonians of the distant past, inspiring the planet's interest in genetic engineering. In "Superman: The Doomsday War" (1998), Doomsday's mind is under the influence of Brainiac, forcing Superman to fight two of his most powerful enemies at once in order to rescue Lana Lang's newborn child, Doomsday easily defeating the current Justice League before Superman is able to force Brainiac's mind out of Doomsday and trap him in four teleporters locked in a perpetual loop to prevent him being integrated enough to think of a way to escape.
