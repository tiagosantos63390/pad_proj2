Fascinated with the adventures of Ghana, he decided to organize a 6-day tour with his faculty mates in September 2012. Planning for this tour began in April and by May he took a 7-day market evaluation of the tour by going to Ghana himself. On his return he set up a six-man committee to handle the marketing and organization of the trip. In May, the faculty decided to pull out from subsidizing the trip and Chijioke had to put in N42,000 of his personal money or the trip will be called off. As Murphy’s Law will have it, things got worse at the worst possible time when the University of Lagos went on a two weeks sudden break and planning had to be suspended till June 16. On July 3, he had an emergency surgery that kept him hospitalized for 6-days; but he kept getting daily planning updates. First payment for the trip came August 14 and subsequent payments followed. With 33 people on board at N35,000 a head, the trip took place between September 27 – October 2, 2012.
