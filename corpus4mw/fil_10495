Variety described the song as "the exuberant second act opener", yet noted "it’s impossible to miss the poignancy of inchoate feelings of loss and hope flooding beneath the surface". The Hollywood Reporter wrote "Only the most chronic misanthrope could fail to get misty-eyed when these mistreated kids glide back and forth on long rope swings singing “When I Grow Up.” That song’s soul-stirring mix of yearning and escape encapsulates what makes Matilda such a joy." New York Magazine wrote "It must be a relief for the young actors — I know it is for the audience — when at the beginning of act two they get to sing a lovely, simple, Beatles-like tune called “When I Grow Up” while flying on rope swings high above the stage". The New York Times noted many adults said they cried during this song, "the show’s most conventionally pretty number". New Jersey Newsroom described it as "jubilant". Chicago Tribute said the song was the "most remarkable moment" of the show, "simple", and "gorgeous". TimeOut wrote "“When I Grow Up” is a particularly affecting, wistful number that captures kids aching for adulthood, blissfully ignorant of its pains and burdens.". Entertainment Weekly named it "the second-act show-stopper", and said the song "takes a simple, round-like melody and artfully sketches a pint-size perspective on the supposedly absolute freedoms of adulthood". Out named it "the barn-raiser song".
