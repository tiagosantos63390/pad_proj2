The third season of Happy Endings continued the series' critical acclaim. In regards to the premiere, David Sims of the "The AV Club" stated "In a TV landscape increasingly dotted with low-concept ensemble comedies that are trying to be all whip-smart and funny, it’s nice to have "Happy Endings" back to put ’em all in their place." Verne Gay of "Newsday" said that "Happy Endings", cast and all, has now officially jelled. The show exists on the same cosmic (and comic) TV plane as "Scrubs," "Arrested Development" and that other late bloomer, "Cougar Town." Maureen Ryan of "The Huffington Post" stated that "Happy Endings" has so many things going for it that the occasional weak story line or meh scene is not a big deal at all. It's one of the sharpest and warm-hearted comedies on the air, and I enjoy it a lot more than "Modern Family..." Clay Sublett of "Splitsider" said that "If ABC is willing to give them a chance, Happy Endings can come back in season four and fill the hole "30 Rock" will leave in our hearts."
