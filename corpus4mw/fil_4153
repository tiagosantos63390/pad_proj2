At the start of X-Men, a preteen Magneto was separated from his parents by Nazi soldiers in a concentration camp, and it was during this moment that his powers begin to manifest (twisting open a metal fence separating him and his parents). In the present time, Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use her as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Robert Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor that does he care. In the end, he is incapacitated by Cyclops after being distracted by Wolverine and locked up in a plastic prison.
