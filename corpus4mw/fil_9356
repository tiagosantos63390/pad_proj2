Whether thrusting her crotch towards the crowd, or simply standing smiling down at them, when Rihanna is in front of you, you can’t take your eyes off her. Whether you agree with her morals or not, one cannot deny that the woman knows how to own a stage." Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the concert three out of five stars and concluded that although the concert was a "nonetheless a well-honed show that had its moments" including a 70,000 crowd singing "We Found Love" and "Only Girl (In the World)", it lacked shocking moments and spontaneity that "let her down".
