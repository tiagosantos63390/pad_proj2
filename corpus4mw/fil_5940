In "Dark Fire" David is ordered by the elder dragons of Ki:mera to seek out and destroy a spark of dark fire, even though doing so will mean sacrificing the beloved housework dragon, Gwillan. Also, David's first girlfriend, Sophie, died in Africa while David was there trying to stop a mutation called a darkling from destroying the entire facility. He uses Gwillan's and Grace's fire tears to attempt to revive the fallen clay dragons back to their original selves. As David struggles to reach a compromise, dragons all over the world begin to wake, and the Earth enters a new Dragon Age.
