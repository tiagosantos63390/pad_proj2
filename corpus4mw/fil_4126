Bertrand de Jouvenel made the link between the Non-Conformists and the supporters of "planisme", a new economical theory invented by the Belgian Henri de Man, as well as with the technocratic "Groupe X-Crise". They influenced both Vichy's "Révolution nationale" ("Jeune France", Ecole des cadres d'Uriage, etc.) and political programs of the Resistance ("Combat", "Défense de la France", OCM, etc.) In November 1941, René Vincent, in charge of Vichy censorship services, created the journal "Idées" (1941–44) which gathered the Non-Conformists who supported Marshal Philippe Pétain's regime.
