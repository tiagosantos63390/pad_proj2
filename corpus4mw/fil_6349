Tyrell accidentally crashes one of Ivan's inventions, a soarwing, so Isaac sends him out with Matthew and Karis to retrieve a feather of the mountain roc to build a new one. Along the way they encounter the villains Blados, Chalis, and Arcanus. After Rief gets separated from Kraden and his sister Nowell, he joins the party to meet up with Kraden. After activating two Alchemy Machines (a Forge and a Well) they come to the country of Morgal, where beastmen live. Shortly after they obtain the roc feather, they were tricked into activating the Luna Tower, triggering the Grave Eclipse and causing death and suffering across much of the continent. The children then fight to end the eclipse by activating Apollo's Lens, an alchemy machine powered by the Alchemy Forge and Alchemy Well, and defeating Blados, Chalis and a dark monster, who was in secret Sveta's brother. After activating the Apollo's lens and stopping the Grave Eclipse they parted ways from their new friends to return home. However, they return to find an unusually large Psynergy Vortex greeting them. Finally, Arcanus reveals himself to be Alex, who survived the rising of the Golden Sun at the end of The Lost Age and is still at large with unknown intentions.
