The 2013 Edmonton municipal election was held Monday, October 21, 2013 to elect a mayor and 12 councillors to the city council, seven of the nine trustees to Edmonton Public Schools, and the seven trustees to the Edmonton Catholic Schools. Two incumbent public school trustees had no challengers. From 1968 to 2013, provincial legislation has required every municipality to hold elections every three years. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta passed a bill on December 5, 2012, amending the Local Authorities Election Act. Starting with the 2013 elections, officials are elected for a four-year term, and municipal elections are moved to a four-year cycle.
"Regina Maris" was built to ply the Iceland-to-Baltic codfish trade. The original wooden hull was completed in 1908. It was the 100th hull produced by the shipyard of J. Ring Anderson in Svendborg, Denmark. The ship was at one time believed to have been involved in the rescue of Danish Jews during World War II, but this was later disproven.
