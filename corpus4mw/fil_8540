In 1921, a boiler room was added at the back of the building and a bathroom installed. Bucket lavatories (situated by staircases and emptied daily) were still in use, however, and whilst education was now an option, children had to make the majority of their uniforms themselves. Conditions did improve during the 1920s though, to the extent that by 1930, the building was little more than a hospital caring for sick townspeople, mainly the elderly. Subsequently, the workhouse closed and fell into dereliction. Nearby Coates school used part of the building between June 1937 and April 1938 whilst their own was extended and renovated to cope with overcrowding.
The population of Mbuji-Mayi grew rapidly with the immigration of Luba people from other parts of the country.
