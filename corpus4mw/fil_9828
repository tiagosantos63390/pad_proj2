Specifically, the act specifies that students attending schools labeled as under-performing by state standards now have the option to transfer to a different school in the district, whether it is a state, private, or charter school. The act also suggested that if a failing school cannot show adequate yearly progress, it will be designated a charter school.

During the following two years Frank Kraaijeveld established his own band, in collaboration with Cees Brouwer. Pleines and van Schie, meanwhile, toured under the name 14all (read "one for all"). In 1988 Decca rereleased two Bintangs albums, "Travelling in the USA" (1970) and "Ridin' with the Bintangs" (1972), under the title "Original Tapes". The Bintangs reunited the following year, with Gus Pleines, Frank Kaaijeveld, Jack van Schie, Jan Wijte and Cees Brouwer. Although initially intent on doing a concert in each of the 12Â provinces of the Netherlands, this lineup lasted 13 years; Frank Kraaijeveld described his experience outside the Bintangs as "unsatisfying". Covering the reunion, "Het Vrije Volk" described the Bintangs as "the most underrated live band from Netherlands" while Jacob Haagsma of the "Leeuwarder Courant" wrote "it's good that the Bintangs came back to us".

The first state elections after the 2nd World War were held on 30 June 1946, when 180 delegates were chosen. The main task of those delegates was to draft a new Bavarian constitution. The new constitution was accepted by a public vote on 1 December 1946, the same day the first bavarian parliament after the 2nd World War was elected.

Though Bogard would presumably have mostly agreed on matters of faith and biblical interpretation with J. Frank Norris, the controversial Baptist fundamentalist figure from Fort Worth, he claimed that Norris was vain and prone to exaggerate Norris' ministerial success. Though he accused Norris of failing to preach the fundamentals of the faith, the two in time developed a begrudging friendship. Bogard said, "When I get to heaven I expect to find Frank Norris there in spite of that wicked streak that runs through him." In 1941, Norris faced a $25,000 libel judgment rendered in San Antonio, Texas, payable to another Baptist minister, R. E. White, because of remarks about White in a Detroit, Michigan, denominational paper, "The Fundamentalist". The publicity about the suit weakened Norris' hold over his fellow fundamentalists.
