Following the departure of Sean Connor from his post at Dundalk, 24 hours after the final game of the season, Ian Foster sought permission from Galway United CEO Nick Leeson to speak with Dundalk, but was denied. He subsequently resigned his position and was appointed team manager at Dundalk on 4 December 2009. Foster cited alleged payment problems during the season as justification for his contact with Dundalk and his subsequent appointment there.
"Hybrids" are a cross between a wood and an iron, giving these clubs the wood's long distance and higher launch, with the iron's familiar swing. The club head of a hybrid has a wood-inspired, slightly convex face, and is typically hollow like modern metal woods to allow for high impulse on impact and faster swing speeds. The head is usually smaller than true woods, however, not extending as far back from the face, and the lie and shaft length are similar to an iron giving similar swing mechanics. These clubs generally replace low-numbered irons in a men's set (between 2 and 5, most commonly 3â€“4), which are typically the hardest clubs in a player's bag to hit well. By doing so they also generally make higher-lofted woods redundant as well. However, some manufacturers produce "iron replacement" sets that use hybrid designs to replace an entire set of traditional irons, from 3 to pitching wedge. Ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature a combination of high-lofted woods (up to 7w) and hybrids to replace the 5, 6 and 7-irons, allowing these players to get greater carry distances with slower swings.
