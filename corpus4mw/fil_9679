Fell Historic District is a national historic district located at Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware. It encompasses eight contributing buildings in a steeply sloped area along Red Clay Creek. The area developed in the 19th century as a wealthy gentleman's country manufacturing/farming estate. It includes the stuccoed fieldstone, Greek Revival style Fell Mansion (c. 1835); a Romanesque Revival stone carriage house (1893); a Carpenter Gothic frame gatehouse (c. 1860); two frame tenant houses (c. 1860), one of which was built in a, "Swiss Chalet" style; a stone barn and a stuccoed stone miller's residence (c. 1800); and a stone Georgian Revival dwelling dating from 1925.
