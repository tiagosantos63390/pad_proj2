Maungatautari is an eroded andesitic volcano. It was chosen as a suitable site for the project for a number of reasons, including the diversity of its terrain, the relative integrity of natural areas in spite of some human engineered changes, the commitment of surrounding communities, and the feasibility of fence-construction given surrounding developed terrain. 

The Labrador Hotel was built circa 1881 by Fredrick Shaw on land originally part of Robert Muirs' selection. The hotel had fifteen bedrooms and three sitting rooms, out houses and stables sufficient for regular use by Queensland coach service "Cobb and Co". Passengers arriving by boat from Brisbane were also taken to the hotel by the Cobb and Co. In 1844 the hotel lease was taken by John Langdon who secured a Country Publican's licence with liquor licence. The hotels business declined when another Hotel opened at the northern tip of Labrador, Deepwater point, in 1886. Mr Langdon sold the Labrador Hotel to a Maria Matilda Crooke at auction in April 1888. The hotel was completely destroyed by fire later in 1888.
At the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War Linevich was temporarily in charge of the Russian Manchurian Army until the arrival of General Aleksey Kuropatkin on March 15, 1904. He was again placed in command of the First Manchurian Army from October 1904 to March 3, 1905. After the Russian defeat at the Battle of Mukden, General Kuropatkin was relieved of his command, and Linevich was promoted to succeed him as commander in chief of the Russian armies in the Far East. However, once promoted, Linevich procrastinated, irking Tsar Nicholas II with never-ending demands for reinforcements, insisting that he had to have a 1.5:1 numerical superiority before he would be able to go on the offensive against the Japanese positions. He opposed peace negotiations with Japan, advising Tsar Nicholas that victory on land was certain once the requisite reinforcements arrived. After the Treaty of Portsmouth ended the war, Linevich oversaw the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria, hampered by strikes and revolutionary agitation by the railroad workers. He refused to take action against the workers, and when a portion of his troops revolted as part of the Russian Revolution of 1905, he was in no hurry to put down the risings. As a result, he was relieved of his duties in February 1906.

The "Latigo y Daga" system was formulated in 1987 by Tom Meadows. Through his research and experience working with various whips in conjunction with multiple martial arts systems and styles, he formed "Latigo y Daga" and developed a standardized vocabulary for whip techniques. The primary aspects of "Latigo y Daga" are the use of the 4-ft. whip, the combination of using a dagger with whip, and using the empty hand with a whip. 
A tile substitution with respect to the prototiles P is a pair formula_12, where formula_13 is a linear map, all of whose eigenvalues are larger than one in modulus, together with a substitution rule formula_14 that maps each formula_7 to a tiling of formula_3. The tile substitution formula_14 induces a map from any tiling T of a region W to a tiling formula_18 of formula_19, defined by

First generation migrants are those who, as adults, themselves made the move from one country to another. Second generation migrants are the children of migrants, who were either very young at the time of migration or were born in the country of arrival. The perspectives across the generations can differ enormously. Some critics have even used the term "third generation migrants", though it is highly questionable whether this is meaningful: if a third generation is still culturally distinct it is probably more useful to speak of an established ethnic minority.

According to Firmicus Maternus (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named Nechepso and his priest Petosiris. The Hermetic texts were also put together during this period and Clement of Alexandria, writing in the Roman era, demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:
