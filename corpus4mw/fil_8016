In 1989 a GDR publication put the membership of the VdgB at 632,000 persons. During the Peaceful Revolution the VdgB suffered due to its extensive connections with the ruling Socialist Unity Party. In February 1990 it changed its name to the Farmers Association of the GDR, but was unable to make the transition from East German society to that of a reunified Germany.
