The parish was created in 1931 by combining the former civil parishes of "Little Ponton" and "Stroxton".
The creature in portrayed in the film is a "Vittra", a creature from the Swedish folklore that is believed to live underground. The belief in Vittror (plural form) predates the introduction of Christianity in Scandinavia. The word "Vittra" (which also is the Swedish word for "wither" hence the English title) is derived from the Norse word ""Vættr"", which is also used as an umbrella term for creatures similar to the Vittra. A Vittra is essentially a nature spirit and one of the animistic elements of the Norse religion. Vättern is believed by some to possibly be named after the Vættr, which would mean the original name meant something along the lines of ""lake of the Vættr"".
