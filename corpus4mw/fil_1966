The Professor begins the cloning process and his computer informs him that Seymour died at the age of 15, meaning he lived for twelve years after Fry was frozen. Fry has a change of heart, and aborts the cloning process, believing that Seymour must have moved on with his life, found a new owner, and forgotten about him, saying "I had Seymour until he was three. That's when I knew him, and that's when I loved him. I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago." A flashback then shows that in the years that passed after Fry left, Seymour had faithfully obeyed Fry's last command, which was to wait in front of Panucci's Pizza until he returned. Seymour stays there as the years pass and he, the pizzeria, and Mr. Panucci begin to show their age. In the final shot, Seymour lies down and closes his eyes.

The Entomopter performs obstacle avoidance and altimetry through the use of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) acoustic transmission created from the waste gas product from fuel decomposition within the RCM. This waste gas is also used for gas bearings (dry lubrication) of all moving parts as well as the circulation controlled "blowing" of the wings for stability control and navigation.

The same mechanism operates in the case of negatively charged phosphate groups on a DNA backbone: even though positive ions are present in solution, the relatively weak net electrostatic force prevents them from forming stable ionic bonds with phosphates and precipitating out of solution.

He handed over the Magpies captaincy to Nathan Buckley at the end of 1998, despite his willingness to keep the leadership role. As his career was coming to an end, he continued to play brilliant football in 1999 despite the team's lack of success, and was impressive with the youngsters around him, with another top three finish in the best and fairest. He retired at the end of 2000.
An Inhibition is a writ that prohibits a debtor from selling or burdening his or her property and an Adjudication is a transfer of property to a creditor in payment of a debt. The purpose of this register is to give notice to the public that the persons inhibited are unable to grant a good title.

Indeed, since all official communications emanating from the Canadian government must be available in French and English, because of the official bilingual services act of 1968, and weather bulletins represent a large amount of translation in real time, junior translators had to spend several months of purgatory producing first draft translations, then revised by seniors. That was in fact a quite difficult job, because of the specificities of the English and French sublanguages used, and not very motivating, as the lifetime of a bulletin is only 4 hours.
