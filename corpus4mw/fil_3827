Although Stems IIB and IA can bind Rev in isolation, a full-length RRE (at least ~250 nt) is required for viral function. Multiple molecules of Rev bind to the full RRE in a specific and co-operative manner through a combination of Rev-RNA and Rev-Rev interactions. It is believed that IIB acts as an "anchor point", with the Rev molecules bound at secondary sites (such as IA) stabilized by protein-protein interactions with other Rev molecules (in addition to the RNA-protein interactions). Biochemical studies on a 242-nucleotide RRE have established a ratio of 6 Rev monomers to each RRE.
It is predicted to guide 2'O-ribose methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 28S residue A1511.

The glacier is one of four on Mount Rainier that are known to have released debris flows. Similar flows have stemmed from the Nisqually, Kautz, and Winthrop glaciers as well. The glacier has at least 23 recorded debris flows since 1967, with 15 reported between the years 1986 and 1992. The floods have caused damage and disruption to the roads and picnic areas downstream.

The African river martin ("Pseudochelidon eurystomina") is a passerine bird, one of two members of the river martin subfamily of the swallow family, Hirundinidae. When discovered, it was not initially recognised as a swallow, and its structural differences from most of its relatives, including its stout bill and robust legs and feet, have led to its current placement in a separate subfamily shared only with the Asian white-eyed river martin. The African river martin is a large swallow, mainly black with a blue-green gloss to the head and a greener tint to the back and wings. The under-wings are brownish, the underparts are purple-black, and the flight feathers are black. This martin has red eyes, a broad orange-red bill and a black, square tail. Young birds are similar in appearance to the adults, but have browner plumage. This species has a variety of unmusical calls, and displays both in flight and on the ground, although the purpose of the terrestrial display is unknown.
