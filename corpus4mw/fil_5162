The family was poor and struggled to pay the fees to send Jelimo to secondary school — her two older siblings had already dropped out as they were unable to meet the costs. She refused to quit and began selling milk from the family cattle to pay her fees, traversing steep slopes on foot to sell it at Chemase market. The school headmaster Daniel Maru donated money for track suits and running shoes so that Jelimo could attend Kenya's centre of excellence for distance running. By 2004, Jelimo had reached the local provincial championships in the 400 m. Maru continued his generosity, allowing the young athlete to graduate while she still owed one year's worth of fees.

As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view." A 12-month systematic review commissioned by the FSA in 2009 and conducted at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine based on 50 years' worth of collected evidence concluded that "there is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content." There is no support in the scientific literature that the lower levels of nitrogen in certain organic vegetables translates to improved health risk.

Ronzi returned to Italy in 1825, her marriage fell apart, and she might have had problems with her voice. For the next five years she worked hard to refine her technique and extension until she became a soprano sfogato like Grisi, Ungher, Malibran, and Pasta. On 13 April 1831 the Milanese newspaper "L'Eco" announced her return to Naples to restart her operatic career. She was engaged at the San Carlo in Naples, where she also won considerable acclaim in roles Donizetti wrote specifically for her. Ronzi's biggest triumph in Naples was her performances as the title character in Rossini's "Semiramide"; in Rome, in 1834, she earned an equally remarkable success in her first "Norma" at the Teatro Apollo. Her debut at Milan's La Scala took place in 1834, when she successfully sang the title role in Donizetti's "Gemma di Vergy". She had repeated curtain calls and a critic wrote that her "demeanour was noble, natural and dignified without exaggeration and affectation, her accent was beautiful, crisp and expressive; her singing all Italian and of the best school."
