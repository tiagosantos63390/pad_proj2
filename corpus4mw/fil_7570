Bhabani Charan started with the Sambad Kaumudi, which was first published on 4 December 1821 under his editorship. It was actually the main vehicle of Ram Mohan Roy's campaign against Sati. Although Ram Mohan Roy was the owner, Sambad Kaumudi was published in the name of Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay. The latter soon found Ram Mohan's ideas too radical and parted company to start a rival newspaper called Samachar Chandrika, which became an organ of orthodox Hinduism. According to a different source, Kaumudi was started by Tarachand Dutta and Bhabani Charan Bandopadhyay. Though Bhabani Charan Bandopadhyay was nominally in charge of this weekly till the publication of its thirteenth issue, Ram Mohan was its promoter, and for all practical purposes, also its editor. After Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay, Harihar Dutta was the editor for some time, followed by Gobinda Chandra Kongar. Due to lack of sufficient patronage Sambad Kaumudi had to stop publication in October 1822.

The program, which has been compared to "Punk'd" and "Candid Camera", featured celebrities such as actress Asia Kamal and comedian Jassim Sharaf, who were ostensibly invited to the headquarters of al-Baghdadia for an interview. While the celebrities were en route, fake bombs were placed in their cars, without their knowledge. They were then stopped at an apparent military checkpoint, by soldiers in on the prank, who "discovered" the fake bomb and accused the celebrity of being a terrorist or suicide bomber. The soldiers then threatened the celebrity with detention and execution unless he or she told what he or she knew, while a hidden camera filmed the celebrity's reaction.

The Banglabandha port was formally inaugurated in May 2004 but has not been fully functional owing to the absence of a transit agreement for the use of Indian territory as a transport route for Bangladeshi, Nepalese and Bhutanese trade cargoes. Nepali transport trucks are not allowed entry into Bangladesh and must exchange their cargo at the "zero point" of the Indo-Bangladesh border. Indian authorities also limit transport from Nepal to Bangladesh to only two hours a day. The existing Indo-Nepalese agreement provides for cross-border transport between the two countries, but no arrangement for use of Indian territory to link Nepal and Bangladesh. But in 2010, a joint communique issued by the Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh and the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed said both countries would cooperate to provide Nepalese and Bhutanese cargo access to the Bangladeshi ports. The commerce secretaries of Nepal and Bangladesh also held high-level talks to form an agreement resolving the transit issues between the two countries.
Dr. Pica has concentrated his research on the notion of parameters in linguistic. He has also shown that the respective properties of reflexive pronouns could be derived from their morphological properties. He is currently studying the distinction between the internal and external aspects of the Faculty of language and is also working on a fine grained distinction between competence and linguistic performance.
