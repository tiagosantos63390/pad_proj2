Inter Standard Roaming refers to roaming between two standards. This term is now widely used in mobile communications where especially CDMA customers want to use their phone in areas where there is no CDMA network or there is no roaming agreement in place to support roaming on the used standard.

The CDMA customers arriving in Europe can register on the available GSM networks.
