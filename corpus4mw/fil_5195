Almost all kura started as a full primary school. Kura Arongatahi teach from Years 1 to Years 13. The age of children ranges from 5 years old to 18 years old, although in New Zealand the compulsory leaving age is 16. Students enrolled from Year 11 to Year 13 undertake NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement). However, before a composite school can award NCEA qualifications, the school must be an accredited provider with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. A kura can only become a composite once the Minister of Education has approved its change of class application. Approval to become a kura arongatahi can take many years, usually at least two years. Funding and staffing of these kura is different from those of kura tuatahi. In 2008 there were 15 Kura Kaupapa Maori Te Aho Matua composite schools. A composite school in New Zealand can also be classified as an Area school. In recognition of becoming an area school or composite school, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Mangere, in Mangere, Auckland, changed its name to Te Kura Kaupapa Maori a rohe o Mangere. Sometimes the Minister of Education will not approve a change of class application to become a full composite school, instead the minister will approve the application so that the kura can become a restricted composite school. A restricted composite school usually allows a kura to teach children from Years 1 to 10. Gaining restricted composite school status does not limit a kura from eventually gaining full composite status in the future, whereby the kura is able to teach up to Year 15.
