Recording for "John B. Sebastian" was completed during the autumn of 1968. By December, Kama Sutra and MGM began planning the album’s release, assigning it a catalog number (Kama Sutra no. KLP/KLPS 8069) and commissioning album cover artwork. The album’s first single, "She’s a Lady" b/w "The Room Nobody Lives In," was also issued in December 1968 (Kama Sutra catalog no. KA-254). The single’s release was accompanied by photo advertisements in the music industry trade papers "Billboard " and "Cashbox" that called "She’s a Lady" the first of "an incredible new series of songs now being written by one of the most creative composers of contemporary rock." The single performed disappointingly despite the advertising campaign, peaking at #84 on the "Billboard" chart.

Frank Borelli, a use of force expert in Maryland said that the scene as shown in the video moments before the shooting would be as important to understanding what happened as the shooting itself. "The four officers have to be operating under a high level of stress given the relatively confined setting and the people on the BART train who are expressing, in a very loud vocal fashion, their displeasure with the officers' actions. Those officers, should things go bad for them, are vastly outnumbered by a group of people who have already voiced their unhappiness with the police."
Another limitation, of course, is that although the right of fair procedure (if applicable) clearly requires something slightly less than procedural due process, it does not require the affected party to be afforded "more" rights than would be available under procedural due process. Thus, when the plaintiff's professional association had clearly given him the benefit of far more procedural protections than he would have been entitled to from any government entity, he had received the benefit of fair procedure and had no cause of action for the mildly adverse action that resulted. 
The analysis of Op Barga carried out in 1986-88 in the 3 districts mentioned above concluded that Operation Barga, while partly successful in bringing about a change in the tenancy pattern, did not succeed in augmenting production and productivity on the barga land where the bargadars had been receiving the stipulated crop share. Furthermore, entrepreneurship continue to remain low because of the inherent conflict of interest in crop sharing mechanism coupled with the fact that the bargadars were not adequately trained in this area. 
In paper making, the most widely used detackifier is talc, anionic dispersants, ethoxylated surfactants, and cellulose based detackifiers. The chemical formula of pure talc is magnesium silicate Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. Talc is a soft mineral with a relatively water-hating surface. These two attributes, softness and hydrophobicity are easy to observe when one pinches some talcum powder and then releases it onto the surface of water in a sink. In addition to talc, there are a number of proprietary chemical products that also are marketed as detackifiers. The common feature of these chemicals is that they are weak polyelectrolytes (sometimes cationic), and they have a tendency to form a film at the surface of tacky or hydrophobic suspended matter.
