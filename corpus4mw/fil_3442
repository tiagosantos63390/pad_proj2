The song was performed fifth on the night, following Austria's Carmela Corren with "Vielleicht geschieht ein Wunder" and preceding Italy's Emilio Pericoli with "Uno per tutte". At the close of voting, it had received the dreaded "nul points", placing 13th (equal last) in a field of 16. This was the first occasion on which Norway had failed to score a point in Contest history, and the country would go on to claim the unwanted record of the most zeroes.
A cascade is basically a differential amplifier with one input grounded and the side with the real input has no load. It can also be seen as a common collector (emitter follower) followed by a common base. Since the input side has no load there is no gain on that side and the Miller effect does not come into play. In addition, Vds or Vce stays fairly constant which reduces distortion. Its advantage over the cascade is that it does not require as much voltage headroom. Its disadvantage is since it has two legs it requires twice as much current as a cascade for similar performance.
