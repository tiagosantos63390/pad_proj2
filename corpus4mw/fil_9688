Gap5 were a five-piece girl group from Auckland, composed of Alex Foster (21), Hannah-Jane Thorne (22), Taiva Ioane (18), Nicole Hedder (18) and Nica Israel (19). At their audition they performed an a capella version of Estelle's "American Boy". The group was formed after the girls were introduced to each other by their singing teacher in December 2012. As explained to the judges at their audition, Gap5's name comes from their belief that "there's a space in the market for a girl group right now and we feel like we can fill that gap." Hedder's previous band Greatwhitebuffalo won the Manukau regional final of the 2012 Smokefreerockquest. Gap5 were in the bottom two three times, finally eliminated in week seven after losing the judges' vote against Cassie Henderson.
