When Labor re-gained power in 1952, Galvin became Chief Secretary and Deputy Premier. He was acting Premier in 1953, while Cain attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. During the Australian Labor Party split of 1955, Galvin remained loyal to Cain and the traditional party, although his support wavered to William Barry when he heard that Cain preferred Ernie Shepherd to be deputy leader. At the 1955 election, Galvin was defeated in Bendigo by the Liberal and Country candidate, John Stanistreet, by just twelve votes. His defeat removed him from the running to lead the party, and Shepherd was elected leader when Cain died in 1957. Although Galvin regained Bendigo in 1958, he was once again denied the leadership when he was injured a car accident days before the leadership ballot, which saw Clive Stoneham voted leader.
