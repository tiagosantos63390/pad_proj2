Launched in 1992, Communique was a software-based Unix teleconferencing product for workstations that enabled video/audio/data conferencing. Communique supported as many as 10 users, and included revolutionary features such as application sharing, audio controls, text, graphics, and whiteboarding which allowed networked users to share and manipulate graphic objects and files using simple paint tools.
Amnesty International called the conviction “a bitter blow for freedom of expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict ... distort both the facts and the law... These women should never have been charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled "Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom" to raise funds for the legal defense team.
