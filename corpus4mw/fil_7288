A bent entrance is a defensive feature in mediaeval fortification. In a castle with a bent entrance, the gate passage is narrow and turns sharply. Its purpose is to slow down attackers attempting to rush the gate and impede the use of battering rams against doors. It is often combined with means for an active defence, such as machicolations, in effect confining intruders to a narrow killing zone. Its defensive function is related to that of a barbican in front of the gate.

Geologists usually account for the isolated potholes, now high and dry, by the plunging of melt water through vertical cracks or crevasses in the glacial ice. These cracks, called moulins, caused water, boulders, cobbles, and gravel to churn with intense cutting power, drilling into the slope of a granite ledge. The three giant potholes at Plummer's Ledge are not only very large and very deep, to across and enclosed depth, but they were cut straight down into a ledge on its 45-degree side slope. The depth is an interesting puzzle. "It is hard to see how either moving or stagnant ice could hold in position a plunging torrent long enough to drill a cylindrical hole ten or more feet deep in rock."
