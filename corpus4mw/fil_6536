The lowermost reach of San Juan Creek begins after it crosses underneath Interstate 5. After passing beneath the interstate, it is abruptly diverted into a trapezoidal flood control channel, with concrete levees and an earthen riverbed. The creek flows southwest, arcing gradually south, and very soon receives the underground discharge of El Horno Creek on the right bank. A few hundred yards past El Horno, San Juan Creek receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, on the right bank. Trabuco Creek begins in the northeastern corner of the watershed and drains most of the watershed's north half. It flows primarily west then south-southwest, through a valley that is generally more developed than that of the mainstem. For much of its lower third, it winds alongside Interstate 5. At river mile 4 (river kilometer 6.4) it receives its major tributary, Oso Creek, on its right bank. In its final course, it flows into a south-flowing flood control channel that meets San Juan Creek inside San Juan Capistrano.
Paleozoic molluscs of uncertain systematic position. This family has no subfamilies.
In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and some areas of the gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.
