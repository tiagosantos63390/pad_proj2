Laserbeak was one of the original ten Decepticons that fell to Earth in the "Ark". Being reactivated and given the Earthen mode of a condor, Laserbeak would participate in many of the early battles against the Autobotsâ€”until a disastrous raid by Megatron led to Buzzsaw, Starscream, Skywarp, Thundercracker, Rumble and Frenzy, getting deactivated by Omega Supreme.
Waters of the park are calm and rich in biodiversity. "Cano Island Biological Reserve" is one of featured reserves along the coasts. These coasts, such as at Drake Bay, are wintering and breeding grounds for the Humpback Whales that come each winter. Ballena National Marine Park is specially designed for this species. Dolphins such as Spinner and Rough-toothed, and smaller cetaceans such as False Killer Whales and Killer Whales are seasonal residents/migrants to these areas. Whale Watchings for these species are also available. Manatees have been hunted historically in Costa Rica, resulting in today's small numbers left. These gentle mammals can be observed occasionally at areas like Manzanillo Beach, Talamanca, and Limon.
