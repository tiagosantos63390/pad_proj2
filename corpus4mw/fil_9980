The government does not know the local population, local population knows the government. Therefore, the government cannot attend to the local population’s needs or is unaware of it. As shown in the book, the government decided to replace the rural area with a town without the locals consent. Thus, the locals were unprepared and were forced instead of voluntarily move out. As shown, this relationship is one of mistrust and unjustness. At the very least the government should have offered relocation, free housing and support (financial and emotional).
Adult "Campsicnemus popeye" has a body length between 3 to 3.2 mm, and wing length of 3.1 to 3.6 mm. Its head is black in colour with dark-brown toward the front face. It has a pair of antennae and a pair of compound eyes, which are distinctively red. The antennal segments are a mixture of black and yellow patterns. The main body (thorax) is yellow, while its setae are black. The mid-tibia is particularly enlarged towards the apical region, somewhat like the swollen forearms of Popeye. The wing membrane is uniformly pale-smoky coloured. The abdominal segments (tergites) are largely brown, with yellow stripes on the sites of tergites II and IV. Each tergite has numerous short black hairs on the dorsal side, and few long hairs on the side. The main difference of a female from a male is absence of large spiny setae on the legs, and the swollen legs.
