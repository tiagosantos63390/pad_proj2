Legacy and influence.
The solution for Earth is a giant ring, called The Arch, which the Hypotheticals transport to Earth and bury halfway in the Indian Ocean. Bringing the Arch to earth requires the Hypotheticals to temporarily lower the spin membrane. After the Arch is in place, the membrane reasserts itself but with changed settings. This new membrane synchronizes Earth time to that of the universe and allows the stars to be seen once again. However, it also filters the light of the sun to survivable levels.
