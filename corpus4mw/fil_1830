"Ciudad del Saber" was born from the idea of converting some military areas located in the former Panama Canal Zone into a center for knowledge exchange. The project was supported by former presidents Nicolás Ardito Barletta and Ernesto Pérez Balladares, and was presented by the later one at the Summit of the Americas held in Miami, Florida in December 1994. The non-profit foundation that manages the park today was created in 1995. The current facilities at Fort Clayton were officially handed over to the foundation by president Mireya Moscoso in November 1999, during the final stage of the implementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Today, the institution provides facilities and support to programs in education, research, technological development and innovation, while promoting integration of institutions, business, and programs.

During game day, the inmates, now calling themselves "Mean Machine", with gear provided by the late Caretaker, overcome a rough start, and Crewe has to help the team realize that winning the game is more important than their personal grudges. The first half ends with the score tied. The angered Hazen informs Crewe that if he does not lose he will be framed for the murder of Caretaker. Crewe acquiesces to Hazen's threat, only asking that the guards take it lightly after getting a comfortable lead, to which Hazen agrees to do so after they obtain a two touchdown lead. After faking an injury in order to leave the field, Crewe's teammates voice their displeasure over his obvious deserting over the team.
