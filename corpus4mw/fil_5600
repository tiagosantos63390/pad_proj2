In September 2014, the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and The Center for Development Studies (CDS) at Birzeit University organized a conference entitled, "Alternatives to Neo-Liberal Development in the Occupied Palestinian Territories â€“ Critical Perspectives". Rosa Luxemburg Foundation regional head and keynote speaker Katja Herrmann stated that she would not have agreed to be present at the international conference had she known about the discrimination that got Israeli left-wing Haaretz journalist Amira Hass ejected from the international pro-Palestinian conference simply for being a Jew. Later, the University officially stated, that "The administration has no objection to the presence of the journalist Hass (..) The University distinguishes between friends of the Palestinian people and its enemies (..) and works with every person and institution who opposes the occupation." However, Hass stated that she was "not told" about the official policy and that "Palestinian citizens of Israel who teach at Israeli universities are not subject to the same policy", meaning that this discrimination is only against Jews - not Israeli Arabs. Hass is known in Israel and in Arab and left-wing politics' circles for her anti-Zionism, and justified life-threatening rock attacks against Jews in 2013.
During the Vietnam War (1956-1975) he was known for giving Saint Christopher medals and Rosaries and giving them out to American G.I.s on R & R in Japan (also to GI's stationed as peacekeeping forces in South Korea). The medals were inscribed with the Veterans Initials.
