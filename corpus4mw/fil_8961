The iLAND project (middleware for deterministic dynamically reconfigurable networked embedded systems) is a cross-industry research & development project for advanced research in embedded systems. It has been developed with the collaboration of 9 organisations including Industries, SMEs and Universities from Spain, France, Portugal, Netherlands and a university from United States. The project is co-funded by the ARTEMIS Programme related to the topic: 'SP5 Computing Environments for Embedded Systems'.
"With NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the support of local, state and federal governments, we hope to develop a safe, affordable and reusable spaceplane by integrating established technologies, such as the RS-88 engine," said Bob Seto, Rocketplane's vice president of engineering systems and analysis. According to Seto, the craft completed a preliminary design review in March 2005, and it was in the detail design phase.

At the end of the 19th century the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) was seeking to extend its railway into a more central location in Paris: an extension from the Gare de Austerlitz to the new Gare du Quai d'Orsay was constructed, including covered sections; the new section was similar to the recently constructed Baltimore Belt Line (USA), constructed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and operated by electric locomotives built by General Electric, which had worked well, and achieved speeds of 80 km/h.
Four months later, Lockhart promotes a heavily pregnant Carrie to Station Chief in Istanbul, but refuses her request to give Brody a star on the CIA Memorial Wall. Carrie accepts the job, but later tells her father and sister that she won't be taking the baby - a girl - with her to Istanbul. Carrie admits she is terrified and sad and can't keep the child, so Frank tells Carrie that he will take the baby. Later, Carrie draws a star on the wall for Brody after a memorial ceremony for the victims of the Langley attack.

The St. Michael of Scarborough was a ship of the Atlantic that was set to transport Scottish prisoners to the Thames, so that they could be transported by Ralph Williamson to Plantations of America and was mastered in 1678 by Edward Johnston. Williamson was likely headed for West Indies in 1679, but due to the longer than expected journey from Leith to the Thames, when he arrived, Williamson was nowhere to be found. It is of some belief that the voyage never took place, and is said that the majority of the prisoners were released and made their way back to Scotland, and some were rearrested at a later date. 
Operational Duties: 1988–1989.
Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF began classifying aircraft at SFTSs as Second Line (Reserve) elements in the defence of Australia. No. 70 (Reserve) Squadron was formed at No. 6 SFTS, and was tasked with army cooperation, meteorological survey, and photo reconnaissance duties in the Adelaide vicinity. The RAAF rationalised its EATS facilities in March 1942, dividing the personnel and equipment of No. 3 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, between No. 6 SFTS and No. 1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. The last course at No. 6 SFTS concluded in September 1945, by which time 2,178 pilots had graduated. The school disbanded on 1 January 1946, re-forming as Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Mallala. CMU Mallala was one of 40 such units across Australia responsible for the storage of surplus aircraft awaiting sale, scrapping or stripping for spare parts. From June 1947, the base facilities constructed for No. 6 SFTS were occupied by RAAF units supporting the Long Range Weapons Project at Woomera Rocket Range.
