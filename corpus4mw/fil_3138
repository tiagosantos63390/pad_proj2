In many of those conflicts, the bright red tunics worn by British infantry regiments had proved to be a liability, especially when faced by enemies armed with new rifles firing smokeless cartridges (this had been exacerbated by the white carrying equipment worn by the line infantry, the cross straps of which formed an X on the soldier's chest). The term "Khaki" (Urdu for "dust") had come from India and was used to describe the 'Drab' uniform first worn in 1848 by the Corps of Guides which had been raised in December 1846 as the brain-child of Sir Henry Lawrence (1806–1857) Resident at Lahore, and Agent to the Governor-General for the North-West Frontier. Lawrence chose as its commandant Sir Harry Lumsden supported by William Stephen Raikes Hodson as Second-in-Command, to begin the process of raising the Corps of Guides for frontier service, from British Indian recruits at Peshawar. Initially the border troops were dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pajama trousers, made of a coarse home-spun cotton and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. For the first year (1847) no attempt was made at uniformity; in 1848 Lumsden and Hodson decided to introduce a drab (khaki) uniform which Hodson commissioned his brother in England to send them - as recorded in Hodson's book of published letters: "Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India" (first published in 1859). It was only at a later date, when supplies of drab (khaki) material was unavailable, did they improvise by dying material locally with a dye. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857 many British regiments took to staining their white tropical uniforms with tea leaves or other makeshift dyes in order to camouflage them. Rifle regiments had long used dark green uniforms (with blackened badges, buttons, and carrying equipment) as camouflage and some units of the Volunteer Force London Regiment had adopted Hodden grey uniforms for the same purpose. Numerous khaki uniforms were adopted by units in the field over the turn of the century but the standardised Service Dress uniform was not adopted until after the Second Boer War.
In the history of the Indiana State Police, 43 troopers and three civilian employees have died in the line of duty. The agency honors its personnel who have given the ultimate sacrifice at its own memorial consisting of an eternal flame and three granite tablets inscribed with their names at a site located on the east side of Indianapolis just off of Post Road at Interstate 70. Their troopers are also honored on the Indiana Law Enforcement and Fire Fighters Memorial located at Government Way and Senate Avenue in Indianapolis which was dedicated in 2001 to the memory of the state's fallen public safety officers as well as in Washington at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial which honors the nation's law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty and was dedicated in 1991.
Governor Dennis Dugaard appointed Craig Price a former Trooper to the rank of Colonel in 2011.

On 11 November 1918, Emperor Charles I of Austria relinquished power and, on 12 November, the ethnic German areas of the empire were declared the Republic of German Austria, with the intent of unifying with the German Reich. The Province of German Bohemia was formed from the part of Bohemia that contained primarily ethnic Germans (however, ethnic German areas of southwestern Bohemia in the Bohemian Forest were added to Upper Austria instead of German Bohemia). The capital of the province was at Reichenberg.

During the late 1830s and early 1840s he lived intermittently in Goshen, New York, where he ran a store. By the mid-1840s he had settled at the family home on Delancey Street in Manhattan. There Riker studied informally for the Presbyterian ministry and began the genealogical and historical research that would occupy him for much of his life. He collected original documents from the colonial era, copied extracts from documents in state and local archives and corresponded extensively with historians, relatives and old family friends. In 1848 Riker moved with his father to a new family home near to the corner of Fifth Ave. and 125th Street, Harlem. Two years later, having given up his plans for a religious career, he began work as a teacher in New York's Ward School 24. James Riker's first publication, a pamphlet genealogy that traced the Riker family to their early Dutch origins, appeared in 1851. He followed it with a substantial volume of local history, "The Annals of Newtown" (1852). Riker married Vashti Wood Horton in 1853, and the couple had several children. Vashti died in 1864, and Riker was re-married in 1867 to Anna C. Clute. Several years later Riker moved to Waverly, New York where he established the Waverly Library and Museum, and wrote two additional historical works, "Harlem (city of New York): its origin and early annals" (1881) and "Evacuation Day, 1783, with Recollections of Capt. John Van Arsdale, of the Veteran Corps of Artillery" (1883). In his later years Riker struggled financially and was forced to auction off a substantial portion of his library. James Riker died in 1889. James Rikers' younger brother was the Civil War Colonel John Lafayette Riker who organized the New York Volunteer Regiment known as the Anderson Zouaves.

The riot occurred because Electrica (electricity provider) decided to cut the electricity of some blocks, due to energy theft and consumer debts. However, whole blocks were cut the electricity, including few consumers without debts. In those blocks there was no central heating and people were using electric radiators (which are energy inefficient). There were also some apartments with air conditioners, so the total debts (not including the stolen energy) rose to €400,000. The stolen energy was estimated to €430,000 per month.

Toni & The Finish announced that they will do a very special "warm up" show at the Gaelic Club Surry Hills on the 5/7/2007 for the basis to have fun before Live Earth. This also was the mark of Glenn Richards on guitar reuniting with the band to perform live as on the band's Look Up tour Richards was unable to tour with them because of recording commitments with Augie March.

The novel was generally well-received by critics. A reviewer for "The New York Times" said that "Burger's Daughter" is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel", and a review in "The New York Review of Books" described the style of writing as "elegant", "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class". A critic in "The Hudson Review" had mixed feelings about the book, saying that it "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless". "Burger's Daughter" won the Central News Agency Literary Award in 1980.

Nymphidius is significant not only because he played an instrumental part in the downfall of Nero, but also because he illustrates the heights to which even men of low birth could rise on their own initiative, as well as the tremendous importance of Praetorian loyalty for imperial succession in the turbulent Year of the Four Emperors which followed the death of Nero.
