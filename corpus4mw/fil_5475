Whereas "hypokrisis" applied to any sort of public performance (including the art of rhetoric), "hypokrites" was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens in the 4th century BC, for example, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed his rival Aeschines, who had been a successful actor before taking up politics, as a "hypocrites" whose skill at impersonating characters on stage made him an untrustworthy politician. This negative view of the "hypokrites," perhaps combined with the Roman disdain for actors, later shaded into the originally neutral "hypokrisis."
