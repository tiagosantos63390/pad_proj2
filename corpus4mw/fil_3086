It was produced as a drama by the BBC in 2006, as "The Haunted Airman", and aired on BBC Four on 31 October 2006, at 22:00 GMT. The Stage praised the production, considering it a "very disturbing, beautifully made and satisfyingly chilling ghost story." Horrorbid.com, however, panned the film, calling it "an excruciatingly boring junker". The script of the film vastly simplifies the plot of the book and drops the whole Satanist subtext of the novel - Helmuth Lisicky of the novel is here the oily Dr Hal - leaving the apparently supernatural manifestations open to question, as to whether they are genuinely supernatural or simply a result of Toby's paranoia.

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.

Since the Dress Act of 1746, Scots were not allowed to wear the dress of their forefathers, ""the Highland Dress"," including Kilts, Trews, and other Tartan clothing. However, the act did not apply to those involved in His Majesty's armed forces. The act had been in effect for a full 10 years by the time the 78th was raised, and Simon fought quite hard, on several occasions, to ensure that his men would be dressed in full Highland military garb.

Dari is a term long recommended by Afghan authorities to designate the Persian dialects spoken in Afghanistan, in contrast to the dialects spoken in neighboring Iran. Although still widely known as "Farsi" ("Persian") to its native speakers, the name was officially changed to Dari in 1964. Dari must not be confused with the dialct of Kabul, which is the dominant Persian dialect in Afghanistan. Apart from a few basics of vocabulary, however (and more Indo-Persian calligraphic styles in the Perso-Arabic script), there is little difference between formal written Persian of Afghanistan and of Iran. The term Dari is often loosely used for the characteristic spoken Persian of Afghanistan - in general the dialect of Kabul - but is best restricted to formal spoken registers (poetry, speeches, newscasts, and other broadcast announcements).
