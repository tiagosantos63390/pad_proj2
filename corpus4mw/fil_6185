Scott told a story of his daughter’s relationship with God and why it is important to him as he continues to mourn her loss.

This was the year known as the Republican Revolution, in which members of the Republican Party captured majorities in the House of Representatives, Senate and governors mansions. Republicans were able to gain eight Senate seats, fifty-four House seats, and ten governorships. The 1994 elections turned out to be an "epic slaughter" of the Democratic Party, with Republicans winning 54 House and 9 U.S. Senate seats, increasing the number of Republican governors from 20 to 30 (out of 50), and flipping many state legislatures from Democratic to Republican control.
