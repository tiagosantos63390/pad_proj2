In the second Detour, teams had to choose between Eyes ("Mát Mắt") and Ears ("Mát Tai"). In Eyes, teams traveled to the Martial Arts Training Center, where they had to learn a series of Martial Arts moves. They then had to perform these moves to the satisfaction of a master to receive their clue. In Ears, teams traveled to the University of Film and Theater where they had to learn and perform the Cải lương play "Lan and Diep". If they could perform their lines correctly, they would receive their next clue. In the Roadblock, one team member had to perform three circus acts including balancing on a balancing board for three minutes, spinning three hula hoops without dropping any for another three minutes and successfully performing a flying trapeze to receive their next clue. These tasks could be completed in any order.
