Roma won the next match 3-0 against Parma, thanks to two goals by Francesco Totti and one by Mancini, thus leaving behind a poor run of two draws and two defeats before the break for the Euro 2008 qualifying matches. The following match was, instead, very disappointing, firstly because Roma played the former "Derby del Sole" against Napoli only with the season-ticket holders, due to the high risk of fights between the Roman and Neapolitan supporters. In the second place, the match finished in a thrilling 4-4 draw, that put the "giallorossi" 5 points from the top of the Serie A.

In 2004, news magazine "The Economist" used Brains' image as part of a billboard advertising campaign. In May 2008, a new TV advertisement for Britvic's Drench spring water was launched; it featured a puppet Brains dancing to the Snap! song "Rhythm Is a Dancer", with the slogan "Brains work best when hydrated". The official video proved to be popular on YouTube, where it inspired various remixes. Giles Wilson, writing for "BBC News Magazine", praised the film's production values and suggested that it was "destined to be the memorable advert of this year", comparing it favourably to Cadbury's "Gorilla" promotions of 2007. BBC Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley considered the advert "amazing"; Gerry Anderson deemed it "brilliant" and remarked that the writer should have been awarded for his joke "Good for Brains". The advert re-appeared in re-cut form, featuring the new slogan "Dehydrated brains don't perform well", in January 2009.
