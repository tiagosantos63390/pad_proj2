However, the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great Jezreel Valley was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier (610 BC), who had been appointed and confirmed by Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.[http://books.google.com/books?id=zFhvECwNQD0C&pg=RA1-PA261&lpg=RA1-PA261&dq=josiah,+book+of+kings,+assyria&source=bl&ots=-skO_wCr7x&sig=A3eJN2mvKabtOIHGXyrXqhgKiKA&hl=en&ei=t4LaSuLKLejk8AbY69G3BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=josiah%2C%20book%20of%20kings%2C%20assyria&f=false Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo, where the fierce battle was fought and where Josiah was killed.

Maunder, Levin, Druce and Cohrs use the sketch for the Amen fugue discovered in the 1960s to compose a longer and more substantial setting to the words "Amen" at the end of the sequence. In the Süssmayr version, "Amen" is set as a plagal cadence with a Picardy third (iv - I in D minor) at the end of the Lacrymosa: the Andrews version uses the Süssmayr ending.
Short-lived submarine activity was discovered by a fishing vessel on 26 May, about north-east of Heimaey and off the coast of the mainland. The eruption finally came to an end in early July, when flowing lava was no longer visible, although subsurface flows may have continued for a few days longer. Shortly before the end of the eruption, a tiltmeter 1150 metres (3750 ft) from the crater which had been measuring ground deformation throughout the eruption detected subsidence towards the crater, implying that the shallow magma chamber which had fed the eruption was emptying out.
