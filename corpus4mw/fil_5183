Whether the above locomotive is, strictly speaking, a compound is subject to debate: the first recognisable compound application to a locomotive was on Erie Railway's No 122, an ordinary American type fitted in 1867 with tandem compound cylinders following J.F. Lay's patent no. 70341. Nothing is known of this locomotive's subsequent career and it does not appear to have been reproduced.

The Navy decided that completion of "Henry Eckford" as an oiler was no longer necessary, and considered converting her into an ammunition ship, but the conversion was found to be cost-prohibitive. Instead, the nearly complete "Henry Eckford" was turned over to the Maritime Administration and towed up the James River in Virginia, where she remained in reserve in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as part of the United States Navy's James River Reserve Fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia. She was struck from the Navy List on 10 November 1997, and her title was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 2 February 1998. She and "Benjamin Isherwood" were the only units of the 18-ship "Henry J. Kaiser" class not to be completed.

Despite Bellamy's lifelong association with Chicopee, he was a detached observer of the social changes unfolding in the growing industrial areas of the town. He was a somewhat reclusive personality who shunned publicity, avoiding social and speaking engagements, including in the years of his popularity following the publication of "Looking Backward". He was not widely known within the town. When it was suggested that Bellamy move to Boston to facilitate the production of the journal "A New Nation" (begun to support and promote the social and political movements established in the wake of the publication of "Looking Backward"), Bellamy demurred, writing "I have the deepest aversion to change."

In 1960, Helenio Herrera joined Internazionale from Barcelona, bringing with him his midfield general Luis Suárez, who won the European Footballer of the Year in the same year for his role in Barcelona's La Liga/Fairs Cup double. He would transform Internazionale into one of the greatest teams in Europe. He modified a 5–3–2 tactic known as the Verrou (door bolt) to include larger flexibility for counterattacks. The Catenaccio system was invented by an Austrian coach named Karl Rappan. Rappan's original system was implemented with 4 fixed defenders, playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker in the middle of the field who plays the ball together with two midfield wings. Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defenders, the sweeper or libero behind the two centre backs. The sweeper or libero who acted as the free man would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs. Internazionale finished 3rd in Serie A his first season, 2nd the next year and first in his 3rd season. And then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965. Herrera earned the title "ll Mago," which meant the magician. The code of Herrera's team was the fullbacks Tarcisio Burgnich and Giacinto Facchetti, Armando Picchi the sweeper, Luis Suárez the playmaker, Jair the winger, Mario Corso the left midfielder, and Sandro Mazzola who played the inside-right.

The extensive gardens and buildings opened on 27 July 1896, with the introduction of Herr Meyer Lutz's Grand Band and under the astute management of Henry Hague, proved to be an enormous success, with the Spa Theatre and the glass dome for ballroom dancing being the jewels in the crown. People could stay all day for sixpence. On the evening of 20 October 1906, at around 9 p.m. a fire broke out. The fire spread rapidly and the building was engulfed by the time the horse-drawn fire engine arrived from its depot in Ashville Street. The fire crew, led by Chief Captain Rennard, managed to save the famous glass dome adjoining the northern end of the theatre. Plans were drawn up for a replacement by Messers Whittaker Bros and the New Spa Company, under the guidance of the architect, Mr W. S. Walker.

The American Evangelical Christian Churches is a denomination founded in 1944, with the aim of 'Security with Liberty', enabling orthodox Christian evangelical ministers the opportunity to minister without particular decrees about non-essential Christian doctrines. The denomination is unique in that it recognizes dual ordination status with most other mainline Christian denominations. The denomination is attracting members of 'Generation X' and 'Generation Y' Christians who seek professional ministerial status after having grown up in an 'nondenominational' or 'interdenominational' church culture. The AECC ordains both female and male ministers called by God for service in the world.
