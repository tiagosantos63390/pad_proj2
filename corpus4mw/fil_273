Minas Gerais is the Brazilian state that harbors the highest mileage of highways. The state highway network is 269,545 kilometers, of which only 11,396 on federal roads and 21,472 on state highways and state coincide, corresponding to all other municipal roads.

Many of the most important Brazilian routes cross the state and, for this reason, it counts the greater proportion of car accidents per capita.
