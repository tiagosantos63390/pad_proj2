Having originally been founded as "Λαίλαψ" in 1925, F.C. Lailapas is one of Greece's oldest and formerly most competitive clubs. Its period of greatest success came in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s during which it won an impressive number of titles. In December 1930, Lailapas hosted the then champion of Izmir, Karşıyaka S.K. in a match of great historical significance, given the state of Greco-Turkish relations over the previous decade. Due to bad weather however, the match was abandoned shortly after kick-off. It was widely heralded as the first meeting between Greek and Turkish football teams, competitive or otherwise in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922.

An awkward passage soon terminates in a small pitch into a chamber where the stream enters. A high meandering passage from the chamber leads after about to a deep rift which is descended in three stages. The descent route involves traversing and technical rope rigging to avoid the waterfalls. The last pitch drops into Stream Passage in Gaping Gill.
