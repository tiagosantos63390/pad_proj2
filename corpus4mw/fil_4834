O'Steen was born in Paragould, Arkansas. As a child in Burbank, California, O'Steen would try to make it onto the Warner Bros. lot hoping that it could be an entree to work in the editing room. O'Steen was finally able to secure a position as an assistant editor in 1956, when he became George Tomasini's assistant editor on Alfred Hitchcock's 1957 film "The Wrong Man". As was typical at the time, he served as an assistant editor at Warner Brothers for eight years; his first credit as editor was on "Youngblood Hawke" (1964), which was directed by Delmer Daves. Within a year, O'Steen had become the editor on Mike Nichols' first film as a director, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". O'Steen was Nichols' principal editor for nearly thirty years, during which he edited twelve of Nichols' films; their last film together was "Wolf" (1994).
