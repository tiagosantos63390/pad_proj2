"Recollections" is a complete poem made up of lines from three of Coleridge's poems: "Absence: A Poem", "To the River Otter", and "Anna and Harland". The lines contain little alteration. Lines 13 and 17–26 are variations of lines 1–11 of "To the River Otter":

His father died when he was young and his mother raised him with his brothers, he was playing for a small team called Al-Faysaly then he moved to a bigger club in Al Houfuf called Al-Ta'awoon. He began to gain fame in Al-Ta'awoon when he was just 15 years old and he attracted the attention of clubs to him, but his family's desire was to complete his studies first. But this did not stop him from continuing to improve and this attracted attention to him more strongly then ever. In 2002 he went for a trial in Al-Hilal where he spent a full week and he convinced everyone that saw him that he was going to be the next big thing in Saudi Football. However, he didn't convince the coach at the time.
