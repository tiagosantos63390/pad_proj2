Background and later life.
RPGFan's Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as "foul-mouthed butcher", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling it "strange and often hilarious". RPGamer's Michael A. Cunningham found Zero to be an "angry, vulgar woman" who is "impatient, aggressive, and easily irritated", and that "while the characters and their dialogue are great, the game's plot is obfuscated by Zero's unexplained desire to kill her sisters." Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek was fairly non-committal about his opinion of Zero, instead describing her as a conscious mockery of standard action-game protagonists, referring to her as "murderous, foul-mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all but impossible to like." In contrast, Kimberley Wallace of "Game Informer" was not as enthusiastic, saying that while Zero had some good one-liners, "the better efforts are buried in a lot of bad party banter." IGN's Meghan Sullivan was also fairly negative, saying that Zero's character, interactions and motivation were badly let down by poor writing. USGamer's Kat Bailey was generally unenthusiastic about Zero's general attitude and portrayal, saying that she was "characterized in large part by her apparent love of killing and her aggressive bitchiness toward her companion dragon". Roger Hargreaves for "Metro" agreed, finding Zero to be a "thoroughly unpleasant and unlikeable main character." Crunchyroll's Nate Ming was highly critical of Zero, stating "While I'm loath to call a woman a "bitch" [...] I think it's safe to say that Zero is a ruthless, backstabbing, front-stabbing, cold-hearted bitch with a boldfaced capital B" as players weren't "supposed to sympathize with her, either — Zero casually murders practically everyone and gets a laugh out of it, and she'd definitely be the bad guy in any other game." The character has been positively received by series fans in Japan. In a popularity contest for the characters of "Drakengard 3", Zero came in as the fourth most popular character of the game, with her dragon Mikhail taking first place. In the 2014 "Dengeki PlayStation" Awards, Zero was placed as the fourth best character of 2013.
