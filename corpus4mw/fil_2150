During the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used Tifinagh writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. It gave the modern Berber latin alphabet.
On 20 September 2006, Agbonlahor was pencilled in as a player in the Nigeria U-20 team for the match against Rwanda. He turned down the call, whilst not ruling out playing for the country in the future, but subsequently pledged his future to England.
The game's protagonist is a mental patient trying to escape from the institute (hence the title). A good deal of the game takes place in drug-induced hallucinations, though in some versions the drug is a "strange powder" that sends you into "dreams".

Their language is also known as Galoli, is one of the Timor–Babar group of Austronesian languages. It is one of the national languages designated by the constitution of East Timor. Because the area was used as a trading center for different cultures, there are a large number of foreign loan words in the vocabulary, principally from Moluccan and Malay languages. Although it is not spoken by as many people as other national languages, it was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church in the district of Manatuto and thus has become fixed in grammars and dictionaries.

Dale V. Sandstrom was born and raised in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He graduated with a B.A. degree from North Dakota State University and a juris doctor degree from the University of North Dakota School of Law. He was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1992.
The Croatian Defence Forces (, HOS) were the military arm of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) from 1991 to 1992, during the first stages of the Yugoslav wars. During the Croatian War of Independence, the HOS organized several early companies and participated in Croatia's defense. At the peak of the war in Croatia, the HOS was several battalions in size. The first HOS units were headed by Ante Paradžik, an HSP member who was killed by Croatian police in September 1991. After the November 1991 general mobilization in Croatia and the January 1992 cease-fire, the HOS was absorbed by the Croatian Army.
In 1902, Lawrence Lambe named a new set of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as "Trachodon marginatus". Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids from the same rocks in the 1910s, in what is now known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to "T. marginatus", and based on the new information, coined the genus "Stephanosaurus" for the species in 1914. Lambe retained the original species "marginatus", so the type specimen of "Stephanosaurus" was the original, scrappy limb bones and crushed skull fragments, not the two new skulls. However, the limb bones and skull fragments could not be reliably said to come from the same animal as the complete skulls, or differentiated from other hadrosaurs. Because there was very little to associate the complete skulls with the scrappy earlier "marginatus" material, in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: "Lambeosaurus lambei" (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869).
However, Derbyshire was fit enough to be included in England's Under-21 match against Italy at the new Wembley Stadium on 24 March. He scored England's third goal in a thrilling 3–3 draw. During the group stage of the 2007 European Under-21 Football Championship, he was the scorer of a controversial goal against the Serbian under-21 team. He did not kick the ball out when Serbian defender Slobodan Rajković was down injured and went on to score England's second goal of the game; in his defence, Derbyshire claimed he did not see the injured player. He took part in the epic semi-final shootout against hosts Netherlands, scoring his first but having his second penalty saved as England lost 13–12. On 28 March 2009, Derbyshire played the second half for England as they beat Norway 5–0, scoring two goals.
Together the team would participate in the 2005 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, but would finish 5-4 failing to reach the playoffs.
