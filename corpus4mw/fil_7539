The Phobjikha Valley is a vast glacial valley at an elevation of about on the west side by the Black Mountains (Bhutan) (range above elevation) that separates western and central Bhutan. The valley covers most of Phobji and Gangteng Gewogs and some parts of Athang Gewog and contains the Gangteng Monastery, also known as Gangtey Gonpa, on a spur surrounded by the village Gangtey. The valley also hosts one of the eight Lings built by a great Buddhist saint Longchenpa which is called Ngelung Drechagling.

Behavioral analysts are divided into two groups. One group believes that by studying current market psychology—as displayed in price action—future market psychology becomes predictable, while another group believes in limited predictability with the inevitability of occasional "Black Swan" events. Behavioral analysts of markets ignore traditional economic inputs in favor of the more empirical proof of intention through action displayed directly in market price movement. Pattern recognition and fractals play a small role in the behavioral analysts' toolkit as they use those technical analysis tools only to help predict potential market velocity as opposed to price reversals. In behavioral analysis of markets, a topping and bottoming 'count' is tracked (most similar to Elliott Wave Principle) as waves of optimism and pessimism drive price.
