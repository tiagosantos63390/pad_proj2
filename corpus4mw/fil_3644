Kieswetter impressed throughout 2006, scoring 245 runs at an average of over 40 for Somerset Second XI. His performances were so strong that Somerset chose to release Sam Spurway at the start of the 2007 season, and named Kieswetter alongside Carl Gazzard as their two wicketkeepers. That season he made his one-day debut for Somerset against Glamorgan in early April, where he made 69 not out off 58 deliveries and took a catch described as "world class" by Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose. He made his first-class debut the following month, keeping wicket while Derbyshire made 801-8d and scoring a useful 63 in the Somerset reply.

Following their first season in the Third Division, York were relegated to the Fourth Division and manager Sam Bartram was released from his contact. His successor, Tom Lockie, led the team to a fifth place finish in the table in his first season, which was only one place from promotion. York reached the quarter-final of the League Cup in the 1961–62 season, when they lost 2–1 to Rochdale. A victory over Aldershot in the final game of the season would have ensured promotion to the Third Division again, but they lost 1–0. York were again forced to seek re-election at the end of the 1963–64 season, as they finished 22nd in Division Four. During this season, a football bribery scandal was exposed by the "Sunday People", and accused York player Jack Fountain of fixing results. He had his contact with the club cancelled and was found guilty of fixing two matches which had been lost by York.
