In aikidō, choku-zuki (as described under karate, above) is a basic attack from which throwing and pinning skills are taught. However, because in most aikidō schools it is the only punch from which defensive techniques are taught, there is no need to differentiate it from any other punch. Thus, it is shortened and simply called tsuki. However, choku-zuki is still used in aikidō, and refers to a specific technique with the jō (staff). With the student standing in hidari katate-gamae, the weapon is lifted to the right hand, which slides to the bottom end of the weapon. The student shuffle steps forward (tsugi-ashi) and the right hand pushes the weapon for the strike, allowing it to slide in the left hand, and coming to rest with the left hand gripping the jō one third the distance from the bottom end. More simply, picture striking a billiard ball with a cue stick, except both hands grip the jō with palms down, and thumbs forward.
