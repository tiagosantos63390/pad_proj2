During Queen Anne's War, Hertel led his first significant independent expedition, the Raid on Deerfield (1704). At the head of a force mainly of Abenaki and Iroquois warriors, but also a company of Canadian militia, he took the men south to the English Province of Massachusetts Bay and descended on the lightly defended frontier town of Deerfield in late February. The raiders achieved surprise, killing 54 settlers and taking more than 100 prisoners. The prisoners, including women and children, were taken on the long overland trek to Quebec, where many were adopted by Catholic Mohawk at Kahnawake, near Montreal.
