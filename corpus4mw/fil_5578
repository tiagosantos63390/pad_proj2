"Memiljeon" can be an ingredient to make other dishes such as "memil chongtteok" (메밀총떡) or also called "memil jeonbyeong" (메밀전병). The dish is formed like a dumpling or wrap stuffed with any available ingredient according to recipe, taste, or region. In the Jeju region, the dish is called "bingtteok" (빙떡) or "Jejudo bindaetteok" and stuffed with boiled shredded daikon. The fillings commonly used in Gangwon Province are "japchae" (noodle salad), or shredded sour kimchi, daikon, scallions, garlic, and pork or squid which are seasoned and stir-fried alogether. In the Pyeongchang region, half transparent noodles called "cheonsachae" (천사채), which are made from kombu, are especially used. The dish is considered a good "anju" because the combination of the savory and a bit blend taste from "memiljeon"' and pungent taste from the inner makes a good companion for drinking alcoholic beverages.
