The score was positively received by critics. Judge Harold Jervais of DVD Verdict wrote how "sound effects, dialogue and Walker's wonderfully creepy and effective score are mixed together to form a very pleasing, almost organic-like whole". Mike Long of DVD Review said that "Shirley Walker’s eerie score comes across powerfully with a wide spatial integration". Derek Germano of "The Cinema Laser" wrote that "Walker's creepy musical score is really a winner, and is one of the things that will help to make "Final Destination" a minor genre classic a few years down the road".
