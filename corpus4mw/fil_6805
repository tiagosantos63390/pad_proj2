Chapter VI, "World War II: A People's War?" covers some key events in World War II and Zinn's service/perspective. He was a ship fitter in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and while a United States Army Air Corps bombarder, married Roslyn Shechter. He notes racial segregation on board his transport ship. He writes that it was the most popular war the US ever fought, with widespread support across many classes of people, but was launched with political deceptions and policy driven by corporate interests, such as: the US claimed Pearl Harbor a sneak attack but records two weeks earlier show that we anticipated war with Japan; Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) claimed German submarines launched unprovoked attacks but the US had really been waging undeclared war with Germany in the Lend-Lease program as an Arsenal of Democracy contrary to Neutrality Acts of 1930s. By 1941 there were over 4,000 strikes, more than any time since 1919. FDR had troops seize mines in a strike May 1943. 6,000 war resistors, three times as many as World War I, went to prison. Unions enrolled 1.25M new African-America workers and this lead to hate strikes such as in 1943 at Packard. The military demanded that Charles Richard Drew, an African-American doctor who invented blood banks, segregate blood by race and after refusing, they fired him from an Army/Navy blood drive. FDR signed Executive Order 9066 leading arrest of every US west coast Japanese. The US extends the Open Door Policy from Asia into Europe, displacing, for example, British oil interests abroad.

The cap is in diameter and, depending on its age, ranges in shape from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. The cap surface is smooth and white, sometimes with a pale tan- or cream-colored tint in the center. The surface is either dry or, when the environment is moist, slightly sticky. The flesh is thin and white, and does not change color when bruised. The margin of the cap, which is rolled inwards in young specimens, does not have striations (grooves), and lacks volval remnants. The gills, also white, are crowded closely together. They are either free from attachment to the stem or just barely reach it. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend all the way to the stem) are numerous, and gradually narrow.

The play contains none of the non-naturalistic flourishes that dominate much of Potter's work, however it does contain two flashback sequences that hint at Daniel's motives in coming to the house. The first of these flashbacks shows the murder of Daniel's father as he escorts the Soviet defector to the British Embassy, while the second features the young Daniel and his father by the polar bear enclosure at London Zoo; Daniel drops a book he is carrying into the water, whereupon it is fished out by a zoo keeper and revealed to be "Cloud Cape". Daniel later states to Mr Hill that he bears no malice towards Cavendish for his father's murder as their infrequent trips to the zoo are all he remembers about him. What the audience presumes to be a fond memory therefore becomes an unreliable one and ties in to one of Potter's major themes of memory as a malleable source.
