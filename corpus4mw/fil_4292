For district heat there is no national market for technological reasons, as heat cannot be transported over long distances. However, district heat is largely produced by the same energy companies in centralised district heating plants or CHP plants. Locally there is usually only one district heat provider available, which means that the competition takes place between alternative heat sources. Biomass fuels and peat are commonly used for district heating. Some district heat is also sold in small scale by local entrepreneurs who produce it with biomass fuels. The government company for promoting energy efficiency, Motiva, has a program for promoting small scale heating entrepreneurship.

The IPKall business model appears to be based on its ability to charge termination rates for calls reaching its subscribers, estimated at about $.01/min, as the service is free for end users. The wholesale price for major interexchange carriers to terminate calls to independent telcos in rural Washington (state) and similar locations (such as northern Minnesota and Iowa) is often several cents a minute higher than typical US48 rates; this money is effectively a subsidy to the destination local rural exchange.

Used to the more subjugated tribes in the eastern United States, Texan settlers were unprepared for the military power of the Comanche and Kiowa. The raids on the settlers were so severe that they pleaded for aid from the national US government. It tried to protect American settlers in Texas. Seeing an opportunity because of the relative isolation of the Texans from Mexico, the US started its own diplomatic campaign, sending a noted American fighter to negotiate with the Comanche on behalf of the Texans. The US sent Sam Houston to Texas in 1833 as a United States diplomatic representative to arrange a treaty with the Pentucka Comanche. Recognizing this as a United States attempt to expand power at Mexico's expense, Mexican officials objected to having the American diplomat in their country talking to their subject Indians about a treaty. They declared Houston "persona non grata" and asked him to leave the country.
