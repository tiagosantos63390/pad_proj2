In June 2012, following the separation of a lesbian couple, the state's highest court granted parental rights to the one of them who had been unable to adopt her partner's adopted child but who had helped raise and had supported the child financially.
Henry Aaron, one of two economists who coined the term "premium support" in response to criticisms of health care vouchers, states that the Republican plan for Medicare uses vouchers, not "premium support". The defining attribute of the plans that Aaron christened "premium support" was that governmental financial support would rise with average health care costs. The Republican plan instead has this support rising with the consumer price index (general inflation). This difference is crucial to understanding the Republican proposal, as the cost of health care is rising much faster than the consumer price index.
