This is similar to a U-Tube Tank but the water crossover duct is much larger and the air crossover contains a servo-controlled valve system. Since this valve controls the flow of air very little power is required. When valve is closed passage of air from one tank to other is prevented and hence resulting compression of air in tank prevents flow of water also. When valve opens free movement of water and air is possible.

His work has been praised for its "hermeticism and poetic depth", characterized as that of a "hyperrealist dreamer" and placed in the tradition of Tanizaki Junichiro and Gustave Courbet, whom Burkhard admired; his photographic reflections on the painter's work were made part of the great Courbet exposition of 2007 in the Grand Palais. A central theme in Burkhard's work was the depiction of the female sex, in an approach that has been interpreted as the "search for the primordial goddess, the focus of all desires". Women were notably the focus of a 1970s Polaroid nudes series with Markus Raetz, the theme of a noted series of photographs on the nape and feet of a geisha, and the topic of a number of huge images shown in 2008 in the "Songlines" exhibition at the Museum Franz Gertsch in Burgdorf.
