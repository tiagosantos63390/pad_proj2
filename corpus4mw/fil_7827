Prizes are promotional items—small toys, games, trading cards, collectables, and other small items of nominal value—found in packages of brand-name retail products (or available from the retailer at the time of purchase) that are included in the price of the product (at no extra cost) with the intent to boost sales. Collectable prizes produced (and sometimes numbered) in series are used extensively—as a loyalty marketing program—in food, drink, and other retail products to increase sales through repeat purchases from collectors. Prizes have been distributed through bread, candy, cereal, chips, crackers, laundry detergent, margarine, popcorn, and soft drinks. The types of prizes have included comics, fortunes, jokes, key rings, magic tricks, models (made of paper or plastic), pin-back buttons, plastic mini-spoons, puzzles, riddles, stickers, temporary tattoos, tazos, trade cards, trading cards, and small toys (made from injection molded plastic, paper, cardboard, tin litho, ceramics, or pot metal). Prizes are sometimes referred to as "in-pack" premiums, although historically the word "premium" has been used to denote (as opposed to a prize) an item that is not packaged with the product and requires a proof of purchase and/or a small additional payment to cover shipping and/or handling charges.

At the front of the DB-10 the thick aerofoil centre section stretched unbroken between the engines, which were mounted upon it. Beyond the engines outer wings of normal thickness and constant chord, significantly thinner and narrower than the inboard section, were each supported by a pair of parallel struts to the lower edge of the centre section. Wing spars and struts were made of steel tubing, with duralumin ribs. A conventional, rectangular section, fuselage with duralumin longerons emerged from the centre section as the thick aerofoil thinned, carrying a tailplane on its upper surface, braced from below. It also carried a single fin and a deep rudder, which moved in a cut-out between the elevators. All surfaces, except those housing the uncowled Gnome-built Bristol Jupiter radial engines, were fabric. The DB-10 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with each single, partly cowled, mainwheel mounted on a parallel pair of V-shaped struts behind the engines. The outer pair of struts was fixed close to the lower ends of the wing struts, at the edge of the thick aerofoil. A tailwheel was mounted at the rear of the fuselage, just in front of the rudder.
