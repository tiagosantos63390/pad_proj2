Jovita Delaney was born in Boherlahan near Cashel, County Tipperary in 1974. She grew up surrounded by an atmosphere of hurling activity. Her father had played with his local club in his youth and was heavily involved in coaching the local juvenile teams. The familyâ€™s association with the game stretches back almost one hundred years as Arthur O'Donnell, a cousin, won All-Ireland medals with Tipperary in 1916 and 1925. Delaney frequently attended games with her family, however, it was not until she attended Scoil Mhuire in Cashel that she first became involved in competitive camogie. It was here that she first tasted success, winning both junior and senior Munster titles in 1989 and 1990. Unfortunately an All-Ireland title eluded her.
