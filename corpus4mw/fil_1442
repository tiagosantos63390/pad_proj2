Dathomir is the planet located in the Dathomir system. The planet is covered in lush swamps and small trees. It is inhabited by wild rancors, as well as by Force-sensitive "witches", divided into two groups. There are various light-following clans over the entire planet, foremost of which is the Singing Mountain Clan. There are also the Nightsisters, who follow the dark side. These groups are descendants of a Jedi master banished to the planet. Dathomir was first introduced in the 1995 book "The Courtship of Princess Leia". It is thought that this planet is the home planet of the rancor. The terrain of the planet is mostly made up of canyons, forests and jagged mountain peaks. Dathomir is home to an imperial prison.

Gardiner gave up composing in 1925 largely because he was intensely self-critical: much of his lost music was probably destroyed by him. Thereafter, he devoted himself to a pioneering afforestation programme on his Dorset farm.
The song is presented as a series of letters to the porn star Chasey Lain from a fan, requesting that he be allowed to perform anilingus on Lain. Over the course of the story, the fan is revealed to be obsessive, and the lyrics get progressively angrier, in mockery of the stance taken by the overzealous fan archetype once the affection is perceived as being ignored.

Such a master of his art was difficult to find even then. However, until the cathedral was finished, there were a large number of procurators in Šibenik such as the Procurator of the factory of Santa Maria. The Pope in Rome was asked to meet the procurators in Šibenik, but it is not known if they meet personally. In 1451, the bishops of Venice became Patriarchs of Venice. Most of the procurators in Šibenik remained anonymous. Their portraits are outside on the wall of the cathedral. Some of these heads on the facade have a damaged nose, probably due to vandalism. Indeed, until Justinian II this was the expression to discredit the reputation of someone, and so it was necessary that this individuals remained anonymous. They considered that too little for the money spent, so Giorgio altered the plan: he enlarged the cathedral with a side nave and apses, so that the ground plan of the cathedral was in the shape of a cross, and prepared it for the dome, built the presbytery, sanctuary and his masterpiece, the baptistery. Giorgio combined the mentioned artistic trinities of the 6 mentioned locations in the ground plan. St. Saviour as the apses, the city of Šibenik as the Lion Gate vis-a-vis of the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto, Saint John (Trogir cathedral) as the central nave what is also symbolized by an eagle as the John the Evangelist's symbol outside on the wall over the main entrance, the San Marco cathedral in Venice as one side nave and the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople as the other side nave. The extension of the line from the main entrance to the apse shows towards Jerusalem, but as an orthodromic distance curve shows towards the obelisk of the Karnak Temple, from where are the sphinxes in the Diocletian's Palace in Split. The description of the Karnak temple by an unknown "Venetian" was brought to Venice in 1589 and is now in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze. The apses are decorated on the outside with various sculptural decorations, including 74 small Renaissance portraits immortalising important contemporaries and figures who had for some reason particularly impressed the architect or that deemed to tight to help foot the bill for the cathedral's construction. The extension of the line from the main entrance to the Lion Gate shows towards the Split Cathedral. Giorgio worked probably on the cathedral up to his death in 1475 and certainly until 1473.
