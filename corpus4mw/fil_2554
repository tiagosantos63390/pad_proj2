In his 1919 annual report, University President Nicholas Murray Butler wrote that the new dorm would "make provision for student life and student organizations which are so important a part of the total educational influence that the university, and particularly the College, exerts." Originally known simply as Students Hall, the building therefore incorporated features, such as the dining hall and rathskeller (the Lion's Den Grill, now JJ's Place), as well as student club space on the fourth floor, meant to foster on-campus student life. It rapidly became the center of undergraduate life, housing the offices of campus publications such as the "Jester" and the "Columbia Daily Spectator". As humanist writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton wrote of his Columbia experiences in "The Seven Storey Mountain", "The fourth floor of John Jay Hall was the place where all the offices of the student publications, the Glee Club and the Student Board and all the rest were to be found. It was the noisiest and most agitated part of campus." John Jay also came to house dances, alumni receptions, and the holiday Yule Log lighting ceremony.

Bentham's Banksia ("Banksia benthamiana") is a species of shrub or tree in the plant genus "Banksia". It occurs in scattered populations in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, one near Mullewa and the other near Dalwallinu.

"Banksia saxicola" grows as a tall upright tree to high at Wilsons Promontory, or as a sprawling shrub in the Grampians. At the latter location, plants maintain their spreading habit even in more sheltered parts, reaching around high there but restricted to high in more exposed areas. The leathery dark green leaves are roughly oval and measure long by wide. They are arranged in whorls along the stems. The flowering period is from January to March, the cylindrical flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arising from two- to six-year old branches. They are high and wide at anthesis. Flower parts fall off the ageing spikes, leaving them bare. They swell and develop 20 to 60 follicles that are covered in fine fur and open only when burnt in fire.
