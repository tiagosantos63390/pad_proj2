Later history.
The Trumpington bed burial is an early Anglo-Saxon burial of a young woman, dating to the mid-7th century, that was excavated in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, England in 2011. The burial is significant both as a rare example of a bed burial, and because of the ornate gold pectoral cross inlaid with garnets that was found in the grave.

In 1711 Snape was appointed headmaster of Eton, which flourished under his management. The part which he took in the Bangorian controversy gave offence at court, and his name, like that of Thomas Sherlock, was removed from the list of king's chaplains. On the death of John Adams he was chosen provost of King's College, Cambridge, in February 1719. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1723â€“4. Early in 1737 he became rector of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, but resigned the living in August of the same year, when he was presented by the chapter of Windsor to the rectory of West Ildesley, Berkshire.
