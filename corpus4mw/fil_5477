Parr's interest in joining the Secret Service originated as a boy after watching "Code of the Secret Service" (1939) starring Ronald Reagan as agent "Brass" Bancroft. After joining the service, from 1962 to 1968, Parr conducted 15 foreign and in 65 domestic protective surveys for various Presidents and Vice Presidents, and worked with security, intelligence and law enforcement professionals in all 50 states and in 37 countries. From 1969 to 1978, he worked for the Foreign Dignitary Division as a mid-level supervisor on Humphrey, Agnew and Ford details. As Deputy Special Agent in Charge, Foreign Dignitary Division, he directed security for 56 foreign heads of state. From 1978-1979, he was Special Agent in Charge of the Vice Presidential Protective Division, where he directed security for Vice President Mondale. In 1979, Parr moved to the Presidential Protective Division, where he was Special Agent in Charge and Head of White House Detail. There, he directed security for Presidents Carter and Reagan. In 1982, he became Assistant Director of Protective Research, and in 1985, Parr retired from the Secret Service. Parr carried a 3"-barreled Smith & Wesson Model 19 chambered in .357 Magnum. This was confirmed in the book "Rawhide Down" and is seen in the hands of Agent Danny Spriggs and other agents in archival footage of the attempt. This was one of the standard-issue sidearms of the U.S.S.S. in 1981, the other being the Smith & Wesson Model 66-2. Parr's story is told in his autobiography, "In the Secret Service: The True Story Of The Man who Saved President Reagan" (Tyndale House Publishing), co-authored by his wife Carolyn Parr. www.inthesecretservice.com.


The success of this concept spurred the formation of the nonprofit Craft and Folk Art Museum in 1973. From the beginning, CAFAM was a “living museum” offering artist-led workshops and educational programs. CAFAM held early shows for now-prominent artists, including Frank Romero, Otto Natzler, and Sam Maloof. In 1976, CAFAM initiated Los Angeles’ first multicultural festival, the International Festival of Masks. This two-day celebration of folk art, dance, music, and food drew up to 40,000 people until 1998. When the gallery was converted to a private, nonprofit museum in 1973, the restaurant took on the gallery's former name: The Egg and The Eye. Edith Wyle was CAFAM's Artistic Director from 1973 - 1984, when she retired. At that point she became a member of the Board of Trustees, and took the title of Founder/Director Emeritus. After 24 years, the restaurant closed forever at the end of June 1989, when the museum had to move temporarily during renovations. The museum was in residence in the historic May Company department store from November 1989 through the end of 1992. Moving back to its original building at 5814 Wilshire, CAFAM mounted exhibitions in various off-site venues and hired the architectural firm of Hodgetts + Fung to reconfigure the museum, reopening May 12, 1995. At the end of 1997, CAFAM closed due to financial difficulties; at the time, it was believed to have shut down for good. The permanent collection was sold at auction; the library was given to the L.A. County Museum of Art Research Library; and the institutional archives (staff files, 1965 - 1997) were given to UCLA Library Special Collections. However, Patrick Ela, who was CAFAM's Administrative Director from 1975 - 1984 and then Executive Director until his resignation in 1996, working with Al Nodal, the General Manager of the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, developed a partnership between the CAFAM Board and the City of L.A., which allowed the museum to reopen after 14 months in February 1999.
