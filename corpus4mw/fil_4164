Whitland RFC is thought to have been founded around 1910, but little verifiable information exists to support a definite date. Club development stalled during the Great War years, but in the 1919/20 season Whitland RFC took part in the Pembrokeshire Knock Out Cup. As with many Welsh teams, the inter-war years were difficult and the team disbanded in January 1930. The club reformed for the 1938-39 season and has existed in that form since.
