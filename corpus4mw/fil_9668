The Simon's Town Museum was established in 1977 by a group of enthusiastic volunteers, the MOTHS (War veterans of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats) of the “Snoekie Shellhole” and the Simon’s Town Historical Society. At first, the Simon's Town Museum was located in the old Headmaster’s house, but its rapid expansion led the Board of Trustees to look for new premises. They bought and renovated The Residency, an historical building erected by Governor Joachim van Plettenberg in 1777, to serve as the winter residence of the Dutch East India Company Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, when on official business at Simon’s Bay. To date, it remains the home of the Simon’s Town Museum.
In the past, the foundation has worked in more than 150 countries and its current work includes projects in Azerbaijan and Sudan. Programmes include the Inquirer Awards, which promotes investigative journalism in a number of countries across Asia and the Middle East.

In April 2013, Will Potter broke the news in his "Green is the New Red" blog that the first charge based on Utah's new "ag gag" law had been made against a woman, Amy Meyer, who had reportedly filmed a slaughterhouse in Draper, Utah using her smart phone. The charges had actually been filed February 19, with the filming occurring on February 8, according to the "Salt Lake Tribune". She was charged with a Class B misdemeanor under the new law. However, a day after the news broke, the public prosecutor dropped the case against her, citing "new evidence" received during a hearing April 18. Prosecutor Benjamin Rasmussen explained that Meyer had provided "video footage showing that she was on public property during at least some of the time she was filming the slaughterhouse". Meyer had previously pleaded not guilty to the charge. Both she and her defense attorney, Stewart Gollan, claim that she never left public property. According to a written statement, Meyer observed several examples of animal cruelty at the slaughterhouse, including "a live cow who appeared to be sick or injured being carried away from the building in a tractor, as though she were nothing more than rubble", as well as "piles of horns scattered around the property and flesh being spewed from a chute on the side of the building".
Her compositions have been performed by Zürich Concert Hall Orchestra, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Ensemble InterContemporain, Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, Gulbenkian Orchestra, Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg, National Orchestra of Radio and Television of Serbia, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, Beijing Symphony Orchestra, Ensemble Orchestral Contemporain of Lyon, Nieuw Ensemble, Ensemble Integrales of Hambourg, Ensemble Zagros of Helsinki, Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, Ensemble Earplay of San Francisco, and others.
