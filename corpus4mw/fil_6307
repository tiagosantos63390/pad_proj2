Born in Sale, Morocco in 1848, he is known to the Jews of North Africa as "Malach Raphael" or the Angel Raphael. In 1880, he became President of the Rabbinical Court or "Beit Din" in Sale and founded a "yeshiva" there. In 1918, he was appointed the first President of the High Rabbinical Court of Rabat, Morocco. He published numerous works on jurisprudence, including "Karne Reem" (Jerusalem 1910), "Hadad Vetema" (Jerusalem 1978), "Paamone Zahav" (Jerusalem 1912), and "Paamon Ve-Rimon" (Jerusalem 1967); some of them continue to be regarded as authoritative.
Born in the United States of America, he spent his childhood in Switzerland. He studied painting at Rhode Island School of Design in the United States and at Camberwell School of Art in London. Since 1976 Jeffrey Isaac has been showing his paintings in numerous exhibitions in the U.S., Switzerland, Italy and Germany. In New York he started publishing the so-called “world’s smallest magazine of its kind” named “Public Illumination Magazine.” In 1986 he moved to Umbria near the town of Spoleto. There he met the American artist Sol LeWitt who became a good friend. During the period from 1999 to 2006, he devoted more of his time to video. In 2004, a minor scandal surrounded a banner he had painted at the invitation of the town Foligno for the annual central procession that showed the patron saint Feliciano riding virtually naked on a horse. In 2007 he designed the animation for the performance of IL CORVO by the LaMama Experimental Theater Company at the 38th Biennale Teatro in Venice. In 2009, a selection of paintings from this period was shown at the exhibition DETOURNEMENT VENISE 2009 a collateral event of the 53rd Venice Biennale.

National minority parties, such as the SSW, which last ran for parliamentary election in 1961, are now freed from the election threshold due to the fact that under Constitutional Law it is imperative that minorities are protected. This special regulation however does not necessarily apply to a Turkish party, as the Turkish do not yet enjoy the status of a national minority in Germany, unlike the Danish party in Schleswig-Holstein, the SSW, or the Sorbs in Saxony.

"The Moon is made of green cheese" was one of the most popular proverbs in 16th and 17th century English literature, and it was also in use after this time. It likely originated in 1546, when "The Proverbs of John Heywood" claimed "the moon is made of a greene cheese." A common variation is "to make one believe the Moon is made of green cheese" ("i.e.", to hoax).
Later in 2006, Liu "et al." published their own study of the age of the Daohugou beds, this time using Zircon Uranium-lead dating on the volcanic rocks overlying and underlying salamander-bearing layers (salamanders are often used as index fossils). Liu "et al." found that the beds formed between 164-158 million years ago, in the Middle to Late Jurassic. A 2012 study by Gao and Shubin agreed with this assessment, and reported an Argon–argon date of 164 plus or minus 4 million years ago for the Daohugou horizon.

The name "irregularity" comes from the fact that for the first surfaces investigated in detail, the smooth complex surfaces in P3, the irregularity happens to vanish. The irregularity then appeared as a new "correction" term measuring the difference "p""g" − "p""a" of the geometric genus and the arithmetic genus of more complicated surfaces. Surfaces are sometimes called regular or irregular depending on whether or not the irregularity vanishes.

The theme known as "radical drag" was a central element to the Festival of Light and subsequent GLF actions. In response to ideas about the 'wrong-sex', gay people distanced themselves from stereotypes of effeminate gay men and butch lesbians, in a way in which gay people were supposed to appear like anybody else. Within the Gay Liberation Movement there was also a deeper questioning of the validity of gender roles. The philosophy underlying radical drag rejected the concepts of masculinity and femininity, which correlated to ideas of dominance and submission. The idea of men who are really women, or of 'real men' dissolves in this deconstruction. In dissociating from the stigma of effeminacy in order to gain acceptance in heterosexual society, gay men tacitly supported the rigidity of gender roles, a definition of men from which they were excluded because of their sexuality. Gay men were complicit in the oppression of the effeminate gay men who adopted that stereotype, often denouncing the camp queens and diesel dykes who had 'come out' and born the brunt of homopbobia before those who were more discreet themselves felt comfortable enough to come out. In 1974, to counteract this, the GLF stated that it had developed "a strong section of opinion which claims that the only way for gay people to come out that will make any real impact on the gender role definitions which underlie gay oppression is by adopting a life-style and appearance that explicitly reject the masculine/feminine distinction and all that it implies."
