It was first a simulated space ship made by Aerojet-General Corporationề for Kraft to sell because it was in a limited market at first. Nineteen U.S. cities had young people waiting in long lines for their chance to sit at the control panels they had from them.

The Vejjavatapada is derived from four passages from the Pāḷi Canon dating from between circa 5th and the 3rd centuries BCE, each of them attributed to the Buddha. The preamble contains two quotes from the Pali Canon, the first line of verse 204 of the Dhammapada, and from the Vinaya where the Buddha, after having attended to a sick monk neglected by his fellows, instructed his monks to care for each other when they are sick. Of the following articles the first five are based closely on a discourse in which the Buddha lays down the attitudes and skills which would make "one who would wait on the sick qualified to nurse the sick.". The final article is taken from the discourse in which the Buddha describes three types of patients according to their response to treatment; i.e. one who dies whether he gets proper treatment or not, one who recovers whether he gets proper treatment or not and one who recovers only if he gets proper treatment. In the case of this first type, he or she should still be treated and nursed out of compassion and just in case there is a chance, no matter how slim, of recovery.
