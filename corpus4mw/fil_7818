A ballistic galvanometer is a type of sensitive galvanometer, commonly a mirror galvanometer. Unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large moment of inertia, thus giving it a long oscillation period. It is really an integrator measuring the quantity of charge discharged through it. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1958
St. Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance and wanted Jesuits to be able to offer whatever ministries were most needed at any given moment, and especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the Pope. Formation for Priesthood normally takes between 8 and 14 years, depending on the man's background and previous education, and final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders.

When the Pope lifted the ban on Catholic participation in politics in 1913, and the electorate was expanded, he collaborated with Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti in the Gentiloni pact. It directed Catholic voters to Giolitti supporters who agreed to favor the Church's position on such key issues as funding private Catholic schools, and blocking a law allowing divorce. Radicals and Socialist condemned the alliance, and brought down Giolitti's coalition in 1914.

The mosque, originally, had two minarets but only one minaret remains standing; the minaret is 14 meters in height and 3.5 meters in diameter. The superb, varied bands of raised brick patterns and inscriptions in Kufic and Naskhi scripts make this minaret the finest of the Seljuk period still standing. The upper section is missing and the lowest section of the remaining shaft has been restored with plain brick bond.
Mary and Caleb were both born into the Quaker (Society of Friends) faith, but by the time of their marriage Caleb "had left the meeting". Mary was then "read out of meeting for marrying out of unity," meaning that she was temporarily or permanently disowned by the faith. Their children continued to have the influence of the Friends through their families.

Along with the episode's title, the Meg and Joe plot line heavily borrows from the storyline, as well as several scenes, of "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle". The scene where Evil Stewie appears in the empty machine is a direct homage to the "Star Trek" episode "The Enemy Within," down to the lighting and piano fill, which has a similar premise involving an evil duplicate of Captain Kirk. While driving Meg to school, Joe asks what a Lady Gaga is. Stewie shown with yellow eyes and Vincent Price's laughter is a direct reference to Michael Jackson's "Thriller" music video. The evil Stewie acts like "Chucky" the main villain from the Child's Play series by David Kirschner and Don Mancini, including the way he attacked Brian, and killing people with weapons.

A feature that sets them apart from other coins of their age is that they were bimetallic. The outer part was made of copper, and the inner part was originally composed of silver to make up for the small intrinsic value of copper — but in most cases 60 percent zinc and 40 percent nickel were used.

The bridge was constructed in 1952 as part of a new routing a U.S. Route 119 on a four-lane highway around the city center. In 1982, the structure was rehabilitated as part of a decade long widening of the route through Fayette County, that included the creation of a freeway bypass in Uniontown, 12 miles to the south. In 2009-10, the road was again reconstructed, this time to accommodate improved pedestrial pathways. The walkways were widened as part of a future plan to connect the Great Allegheny Passage, the Washington, D.C. to Pittsburgh trail that runs just past the western bridge approach, to an extension of the small Coal & Coke Trail, which currently runs from Mt Pleasant to Scottdale, Pennsylvania.
