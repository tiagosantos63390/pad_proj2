There were a series of anti-Habsburg (i.e. anti-Austrian) and anti-Catholic (requiring equal rights and freedom for all Christian religions) uprisings between 1604 and 1711, which – with the exception of the last one – took place in Royal Hungary. The uprisings were usually organized from Transylvania. The last one was an uprising led by 'II.

Doctor Dillamond is a talking Goat and professor at Crage Hall in Shiz. Assisted by Elphaba, Dr. Dillamond conducts research on the genetic differences between animals and Animals (sentient animals). Not long before he comes to a pivotal point in research, Dillamond is discovered dead in his laboratory, his throat slit. The official findings of the ensuing "investigation", spearheaded by Madame Morrible, conclude that the Doctor's untimely demise is the result of an unfortunate lab accident; but these findings are contradicted by Galinda’s chaperone, Ama Clutch, who claims to have witnessed the event. Ama Clutch, though curiously not in her right mind since the "accident", asserts that Morrible's clockwork servant Grommetik murdered Dillamond, presumably to keep Dillamond from publishing the results of his breakthrough research.
