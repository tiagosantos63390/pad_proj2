Jolson continued to make features for Warner Bros., very similar in style to "The Singing Fool", "Say It with Songs" (1929), "Mammy" (1930), and "Big Boy" (1930). A restored version of "Mammy", which includes Jolson in some Technicolor sequences, was first screened in 2002. (Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was in a cameo in the musical "Show Girl in Hollywood" (1930) from First National Pictures, a Warner Bros. subsidiary.) However, these films gradually proved a cycle of diminishing returns due to their comparative sameness, the regal salary that Jolson demanded, and a general shift in public tastes away from the vaudeville-style musical as the 1930s began. As a result of this, Jolson decided to return to Broadway, and starred in a new show, "Wonder Bar", which was not very successful.
