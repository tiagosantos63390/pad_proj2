The project was started in 1984, as the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) granted a loan for the works, although its conclusion was uncertain. Resumptions, loss of median strips in local avenues, and the path itself were all difficulties stated at that time. Nevertheless, the construction was announced to start in 1985, aiming to carry 150,000 passengers a day and to replace a costlier, inviable metro line for that region, though it was superseded with the announcement of line 18 of São Paulo Metro. Effective work started in 1985 when its future operations control center was erected after a ceremony hosted by the Governor of São Paulo, André Franco Montoro.
Based on the life of Park Tae-joon, founder and honorary chairman of multinational steel-making company POSCO, this is the story of the people who battled poverty and despair after the colonial era and the Korean War with a relentless pursuit of economic innovation, and the choices they made in the name of love, loyalty and sacrifice. Park worked tirelessly to build a mill that produced steel, which became pivotal to Korea's modernization.
