There have been several changes in the WKN definition:
There are stories of bullets sliding or bouncing off of metal trauma plates and injuring the wearer(shots deflected off the chest and hitting the head). As of this writing, stories of such claims are unverified and unlikely, as the trauma plate is typically positioned behind the aramid fabric/panels of the vest, and the likeliness of a bullet passing through the fabric, ricocheting, and passing through more aramid fabric is very unlikely. However, to address this fear, many metal plates are encased in special materials designed to trap the bullet and/or its fragments.
