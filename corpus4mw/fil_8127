The family of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs), which includes "chloride channel accessory" (CLCA), bestrophin (BEST), and anoctamin (ANO) channels, have been identified in many epithelial and endothelial cell types as well as in smooth muscle cells. ANO1 is highly expressed in human gastrointestinal interstitial cells of Cajal. Additionally to their role as chloride channels some CLCA proteins function as adhesion molecules and may also have roles as tumour suppressors.
