By late 1966 El Mongol had moved on to Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), where he would have his most lasting success. Under the tutelage of dapper manager Dandy Jack Crawford, El Mongol quickly became one of the promotion's top heels. Another gimmick in a long line of villanous Asian wrestling characters, El Mongol was a rulebreaking Mongol trained in martial arts, who punished opponents with karate-style chops and kicks. Molina completed the character's intimidating visual appearance with a Fu Manchu moustache, queue hairstyle and bare feet. The "Mongolian heel" gimmick would be used by other wrestlers in years to come, with Killer Khan probably the best known of them.
It grows in lateritic loam from Bannister north to the Brookton Highway. It flowers from September to October.

The primary method for using microRNA technology to target HCV is by knocking out the liver-specific microRNA. miRNA-122 binds to the 5' UTRregion of HCV's mRNA strand and, contrary to miRNA's normal function of repressing mRNA, actually upregulates the expression of the Hepatitis C Virus. Thus, the therapeutic goal in such a case would be to keep miRNA-122 from binding to HCV mRNA in order to prevent this mRNA from being expressed. However, miRNA-122 also regulates cholesterol (HDL) and the activity of tumor-suppressor genes (oncogenes).This means that not only will knocking out the microRNA-122 reduce the HCV infection, but it will also reduce the activity of oncogenes, potentially leading to liver cancer. In order to target HCV mRNA specifically (instead of miRNA-122 as a whole), Blockmir technology has been developed to solely target HCV mRNA, thus avoiding any sort of tampering with oncogene expression. This may be achieved by designing a Blockmir that matches seed 1.
