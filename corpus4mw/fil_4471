In an interview with Tiny Mix Tapes in January 2008 Gruff Rhys admitted that "Run-Away" owed much to Phil Spector-type 'Wall of Sound' production: "The drumbeat is definitely a nod to that. We started collecting a lot of old 7-inch singles recently. Cian got heavy into doo-wop music and I was getting into late 60s girl groups. "Run-Away" came out of listening to "Be My Baby" too many times". Guto Pryce echoed this sentiment in an interview with Washington, D.C. website DCist stating that "on "Run Away" that was exactly what we were after, a fuzzy Phil Spector type thing. A dirty, grimy '60s pop song". The track was recorded at Miraval Studios, France along with the rest of "Hey Venus!"

Carr leased the Comedy Theatre from 1893 to 1896. At the same time, his "King Arthur" (1895), a blank verse play inspired by the writings of Thomas Malory and Alfred Tennyson, as well as by the visual images of the Pre-Raphaelites, was produced by Henry Irving in the Lyceum Theatre. It starred Irving and Ellen Terry, with music composed by Arthur Sullivan and sets, costumes and artwork designed by Carr's friend Edward Burne-Jones. This spectacular production was a success for Irving and ran for over 100 performances, also touring North America. Another play that year was "Delia Harding", an adaptation of a Victorien Sardou play, at the Comedy Theatre. Also for Irving's company, in 1897 he produced an English version of "Madame Sans-Gêne" by Sardou and Émile Moreau in 1897, which played on both sides of the Atlantic. Carr also dramatised "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in 1910, starring H. B. Irving at Queen's Theatre.
