The surface system is made of a polymer composite, comprising a monofilament fibre and impregnated carrier layer. This sits on top of a shock absorption layer in an attempt to give an authentic responsive and reactive feel. Other components in Snowflex include an integrated misting system, known as BritonMist, for friction reduction and an impervious membrane for recycling of water. The base is a woven controlling layer which prevents earth movement. The surface layer is manufactured in tile form and as such Snowflex forms a homogenous system which can be cut and formed into features and shapes such as those found in alpine environments.
In June 2014, D-Wave announced a new quantum applications ecosystem with computational finance firm 1QB Information Technologies (1QBit) and cancer research group DNA-SEQ to focus on solving real-world problems with quantum hardware. As the first company dedicated to producing software applications for commercially available quantum computers, 1QBit's research and development arm has focused on D-Wave's quantum annealing processors and has successfully demonstrated that these processors are suitable for solving real-world applications.
