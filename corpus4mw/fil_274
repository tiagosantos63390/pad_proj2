In Wilkie Collins' "The Woman in White" the character of Professor Pesca is a member of 'The Brotherhood', an organisation placed contemporaneously with, and similarly featured as, the Carbonari. Clyde Hyder suspects that the model for Prof. Pesca was Gabriele Rossetti, who was a member of the Carbonari, as well as an Italian teacher resident in London during the 1840s.

From that moment on, Sikorski's 5th Army pushed exhausted Soviet units away from Warsaw, in an almost Blitzkrieg-like operation. Sikorski's units were given the support of almost all of the small number of mechanized units — tanks and armoured cars — that the Polish army had, as well as the support of the two Polish armoured trains. It was able to advance rapidly at the speed of 30 kilometres a day, disrupting the Soviet "enveloping" northern manoeuvre.

The word "Cinerama" combines "cinema" with "panorama", the origin of all the "-orama" neologisms (the word "panorama" comes from the Greek words "pan", meaning "all", and "orama", which translates into "that which is seen", a "sight", or a "spectacle"). It has been suggested that "Cinerama" could have been an intentional anagram of the word "American;" but an online posting by Dick Babish, describing the meeting at which it was named, says that this is "purely accidental, however delightful."
Origins.
In 2009 a decision was made to change the livery on all rolling stock except for the Golden Pass Panorama and Golden Pass Classic trains. This was to include the various railways and funiculars marketed under the "Golden Pass" banner and the buses operated by the company. The colour scheme is to be a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) with all stock being rebranded "Golden Pass". The new colours will be applied to the stock as it passes through works, although the "Golden Pass" logo will be applied as soon as practicable. The first vehicle to be reliveried, First / Second Composite Coach AB307, appeared in traffic on 27 August 2010 (1).
