In 1969 Zika Ascher experimented with a 'disposable' paper fabric, which had to be made resilient enough not to tear. He commissioned Celia Birtwell and put her Happy Bubble design into production - it was made into a famous mini dress designed by Ossie Clark. A photograph on page 96 of the V&A Museum book "Ascher: Fabric, Art, Fashion", shows a crepe de chine fabric design by Lucian Freud. He and other great artists at the time put their trust in the quality of the Ascher printing and colour matching. "Artists commissioned by Zika Ascher were fortunate to have their work sensitively interpreted and skilfully put into repeat...Zika Ascher was insistent upon top quality printing and accurate colour matching; trials continued until design and printed fabric tallied exactly."
