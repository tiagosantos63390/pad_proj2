In episode 11, Prim attempts to takeover Kotoko's body after LeBlanc disables Kotoko. She gains control of it by the twelfth episode and manages to deliver her body to the "Integral System". Before LeBlanc can fire a fatal shot from his Rampant Armor, Prim manages to restrict the computer systems in his rampant armor, long enough for Misaki to fire the finishing shot. Misaki cannot initially bring herself to take the shot. Prim reveals why she had followed LeBlanc. The two are brother and sister, having been created from the same set of genes. LeBlanc's resistance causes greater damage to Prim's physical body, with LeBlanc eventually gaining the upperhand and telling Misaki that if she fires, she'll be killing Prim. She manages to hold LeBlanc at bay long enough for Misaki to fire, shattering the rampant armor and killing Prim.

The genus "Lithobius" includes the following species:
The Rydberg states of molecules with low principal quantum numbers can interact with the other excited electronic states of the molecule. This can cause shifts in energy. The assignment of molecular Rydberg states often involves following a Rydberg series from intermediate to high principal quantum numbers. The energy of Rydberg states can be refined by including a correction called the quantum defect in the Rydberg formula. The quantum defect correction can be associated with the presence of a distributed ionic core.
