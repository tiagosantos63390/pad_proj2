In 1977, under the flag of Admiral Sir Henry Leach KCB Commander-in-Chief Fleet, "Ark Royal" led the Royal Navy's tribute to and celebrations of HM The Queen's Silver Jubilee at Spithead.
Second World War.
There are two broad categories of "suicide by cop". The first is when someone has committed a crime and is being pursued by the police and decides that they would rather die than be arrested. These people may not otherwise be suicidal but may simply decide that life is not worth living if they are incarcerated and thus will provoke police to kill them. The second version involves people who are already contemplating suicide and who, for whatever reason, decide that provoking law enforcement into killing them is the best way to act on their desires. These individuals may commit a crime with the specific intention of provoking a law enforcement response.
Upon her death, Maximilian Schell released a statement, saying in part: "Towards the end of her life, she suffered silently and I never heard her complain. I admire her for that. Her death might have been for her a salvation. But not for me. She is irreplaceable."

Construction.
The s were the last warships designed by Sir Philip Watts, the Director of Naval Construction and the naval architect responsible for "HMS Dreadnought". "Warspite" and her sisters were conceived primarily as a response to intelligence reports that the Germans were planning a new class of battleships carrying 14-inch guns. Watts approached Elswick Ordnance Company and was assured that they could produce 15-inch guns for the 1912 Programme battleships. With the support of Winston Churchill and, indirectly, Jacky Fisher, Watts also switched to oil-fired engines, a radical change which significantly improved speed without loss of protection, leading to the class being considered "fast battleships". Watts produced three designs and the Admiralty selected Plan RIII*, a battleship with only four turrets (as opposed to the five carried on the preceding "Iron Duke" class), but which could still fire a heavier broadside. The space saving also allowed more boilers and, with oil fuel, gave them a 3-knot speed advantage over the "Iron Duke".

June 2011 saw "Portland" conducting night Naval Gunnery practice off Gibraltar in the Mediterranean. Towards the end of the month she sailed to Edinburgh to take part in Armed Forces Day. She is the first major warship in the Royal Navy to be commanded by a woman; Commander Sarah West assumed command of HMS "Portland" on 21 May 2012. "Portland" spent 2012 at Rosyth in a 50-week refit that saw her upgraded with Sonar 2087, new IT systems, Sea Wolf mid-life overhaul, gun replacements, galley refurbishment and accommodation improvements. She left Rosyth on 14 December 2012 for three months of sea trials.
A parody of "Moby-Dick", this takes place in a peapod (parody of Pequod) where there are two captains. The first is Captain Starbuck, the second Captain Ahab. Starbuck looks through a telescope and sees a white animal and yells, "Wait, Cap'n! Thar she quacks! Moby, the great white duck!" Captain Ahab takes a closer look and gives the tagline "Argh! That not be Moby, the great white duck! Argh!", and explains the differences and sounds out syllables, showing, for example, Daisy, the entertaining white snail. The 2 admit defeat before continuing their search. A running gag is the fact that they never look behind them, which is exactly where Moby is.
Fruits are released in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets ("Vespula vulgaris") and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided by the presence of a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.
Early design and construction difficulties involved the steam-tight flexible connections between the boiler unit and the power units. These were solved by Beyer, Peacock's designers after studying a description of the spherical steam joints used on a Fairlie locomotive built for the Ffestiniog Railway followed by a visit to the FR to observe these locomotives at work.

Kite flying is traditionally observed as a part of this festival. On this occasion the sky in Jaipur and Hadoti regions is filled with kites, and youngsters engage in kite contests trying to cut each other's strings.
