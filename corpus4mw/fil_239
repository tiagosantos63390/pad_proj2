Prehistory.
NASA investigation board chair Michael Ryschkewitsch noted that none of the stringent review procedures at NASA had picked up a mistake, saying, "It would be very easy to mix this up."
In his book "Pop Memories 1890-1954", music archivist and statistician Joel Whitburn assessed a variety of sources such as "Talking Machine World" 's lists of top-selling recordings, and "Billboard" 's sheet music and vaudeville charts, to estimate the most successful recordings of the period. He concluded that the Haydn Quartet had 62 "top ten" hits in all between 1898 and 1914, and in the decade 1900-1909 had more successful recordings than any other group, behind only Macdonough and Murray, who recorded as solo artists in addition to their group performances. Although Whitburn's methods of assessment have been criticized, this confirms that the group were one of the most popular of their era.
