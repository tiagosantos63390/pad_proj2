The storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and in a broad curve turned toward the northwest, tracking offshore along the west coast of Florida. It remained over open waters until the following day, when it made landfall at Carrabelle with a barometric pressure of 982 mb. Turning north and then northeast, the storm moved beyond Tallahassee and entered Georgia. It weakened as it progressed inland, and after passing through South Carolina, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean early on October 8. While over water, the storm re-intensified. The cyclone was tracked for several more days as it moved toward the southeast, executed a small loop, and turned toward the east-northeast, passing south of Bermuda on the night of October 11/12. The storm became extratropical on October 13, fully dissipating the next day.
