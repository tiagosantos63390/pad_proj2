Surprisingly, including the centrifugal potential makes remarkably little difference, though the object becomes a "Roche ellipsoid", a general triaxial ellipsoid with all axes having different lengths. The potential becomes a much more complicated function of the axis lengths, requiring elliptic functions. However, the solution proceeds much as in the tidal-only case, and we find
