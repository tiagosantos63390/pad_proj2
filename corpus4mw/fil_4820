The Rubber Soul Project (RSP for short) was a Serbian band. They recorded a single album, called "The Rubber Soul Project", in 1996. The band took their name from the famous Beatles record "Rubber Soul" released in 1965. The band recorded an imaginary Beatles album, by writing music and lyrics to songs for which they had heard only the titles. Some of the tracks were available on bootlegs which, at the time, were not to be found in Serbia, so the members, having read about the songs, decided to record their own songs inspired by the titles.
Because it shares the same frequency as "clear channel" radio stations WWKB in Buffalo, New York and KOKC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, this station operates during the daytime hours only. On May 15, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission fined WXYB with $4,000 for operating during the nighttime hours. Further inspections find that while the station signed off, equipment failure has prevented WXYB from shutting down completely. It has since then been fixed and the FCC also reduced the fines to $3,000 based on its history of compliance with the rules.
