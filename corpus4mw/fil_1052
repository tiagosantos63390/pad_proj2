Vodice was first attested ca. 1118 with reference to its church as "in plebe sancte Margarete virginis", and as "Wodiz" in 1257 (and as "Woditç" in 1265). The name is ultimately derived from the Slovene common noun "vodica", a diminiutive of "voda" 'water, creek'. The name may therefore be based on the singular locative form "*Vodicě" (literally, 'by the small creek'), or may have originally been plural, referring to springs in the area. In the past the German name was "Woditz".
