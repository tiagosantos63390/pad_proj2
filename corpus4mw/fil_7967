The NT$83.069 billion Nangang Project completes the Taipei Railway Underground Project with a eastward extension of the tunnel, including the rebuilt Songshan and Nangang Stations. East of Nangang along TRA's Western Line, the project also includes a short mountain tunnel and a elevated section. Wudu Freight Yard, near Wudu Station, and Qidu Marshalling Yard, next to Qidu Station, replaces facilities dissolved at Songshan Station. The entire length of the TRA part of the Nangang Project is between Songshan and Qidu, and was to be completed in August 2011. Construction was officially completed on October 23, 2011 and began service the following day on October 24, 2011. As a separate NT$10 billion project, in March 2009, TRA also began building a new depot at Fugang, Taoyuan County, to replace its Songshan Depot, which was reached crossing THSRC's tracks.
