The Marion Nichols Summer House is a historic house at 56 Love Lane in Hollis, New Hampshire. The two-story wood frame house was built in 1935 to a design by Densmore, Mclear & Robbins. It was built for Marion Poole Nichols, a wealthy widow. The L-shaped main house is stylistically eclectic, including Tudor Revival features (including diamond-paned windows), Craftsman elements, and Colonial Revival elements. The property also includes a c. 1940 single-story structure which originally house a workshop and a billiard room, and a small brick wellhouse built about the same time as the house.
