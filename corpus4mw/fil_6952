Félix da Costa then took his first Eurocup victory at Silverstone, to take a five-point lead at the halfway stage of the championship. Vergne moved back into contention as he won the second Silverstone race, with non-scores for Costa and Félix da Costa, after the two collided with each other. Vergne continued his good run at Le Mans, doing the double and moved into second in the championship, as Costa retired from the second race. As it stood, Félix da Costa had a seven-point lead over Vergne, who in turn had a seven-point advantage over Costa. The key incident of the season occurred during the Super Pole session at the Nürburgring. Félix da Costa and Kevin Magnussen both ran under appeal during the weekend, due to technical infringements. Again, Motopark would appeal and would lose again. This meant that if Félix da Costa was to win the title, he needed Vergne and Costa to both slip up. Sadly for the Portuguese driver, Costa dominated the whole weekend: two pole positions, two fastest laps and two wins; moving into a decisive championship lead. As it stood, Costa had 114, Vergne 112 and Félix da Costa 97.

The release of the documents triggered international outrage and spawned an investigation by EULEX into the trafficking. This investigation was criticized by Marty who believed that an independent organization rather than EULEX should look into the crimes. EULEX asked Dick Marty for evidence, most of which was in the form of witness statements. Marty refused to do so until a credible witness protection system was set up to ensure that those who delivered evidence are not the victims of revenge attacks by the UÇK and radical Albanians. Marty revealed that the Albanian authorities had attempted to prevent any investigation into Organ trafficking. Hashim Thaci has denied any crimes took place.
