“The son of a singer and a music rep, Silkski says he has music in his blood. When your father is a R&B and doo wop singer and your mother is in music promotions, you naturally grow up with a feel for the industry," said Silkski; but even though Silkski’s family is so well connected in the music world, it is not what got him his start; just the opposite, really. “She (Silkski’s mom) tried to keep me in the nice area”, said Silkski, “but I went the other way.”” Silkski enjoyed the grimey life and cringed away from the luxuries his mother provided.

In 1927, "The Lodger" was the subject of an Alfred Hitchcock-directed film: "", and four other adaptations were filmed in later years.
