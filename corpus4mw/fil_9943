Plans of the influential German primary glider Zögling of 1926 were sold world wide and led to many similar new designs. One of its features was a very simple rectangular wing plan; in Italy, Camillo Silva used something similar in at least seven of his designs, the Allievo A and B (1928?) and the Bonomi series BS.7 Allievo Italia (1929), BS.16 Allievo Bonomi (1930), BS.11 Milano, BS.12 Roma (1933) and BS.17 Allievo Cantù (1934). Amongst these, the A and B and the BS.11 and 12 had wire, rather than strut braced wings. These two pairs differed primarily in the pilot's accommodation; the early two had exposed seats and the later gliders open cockpits in full fuselages, though both the rear fuselages and empennages also differed greatly.
