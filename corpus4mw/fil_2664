For many years after the settlement of the township, religious exercises were conducted by the traveling ministers of various denominations, usually at private houses or in the schoolhouses of the township. There is one Methodist Episcopal church which was built in 1870, and the class there contains a large membership. There is also one United Brethren church which has a fair list of members. It was built in 1874. Amboy township, aside from these two church organizations in the village of Metamora, has one Catholic church, called St. Mary’s, built in 1864, upon section twenty-six, and connected therewith is a cemetery especially dedicated for Catholic burials. The Methodist Episcopal church, upon the town line between Amboy and Royalton, was built in 1867. It has a small number of worshipers, and has sustained itself under adverse circumstances. The Reformed Church of Zion was built by the German residents about 1870. This society and the church edifice is due to the labors of Peter Kohl, who for years was their resident minister. The church building was located on section nine.
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.
Kil'ayim (Hebrew: כלאים, lit. "Mixture" or "Confusion") is the fourth tractate of "Seder Zeraim" ("Order of Seeds") of the "Mishnah" and of the "Talmud". There is both a Mishnah Kil'ayim (m. Kil.) and a Tractate Kil'ayim (t. Kil.). Kil'ayim deals with the laws of various forbidden production and uses of mixtures, as provided in Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:9-11. Specifically, it discusses planting mixtures of seeds, grafting, mixtures of vineyards, crossbreeding animals, working with a team of different kinds of animals, and shaatnez (clothes containing a mixture of linen and wool). There is a Gemara from the Jerusalem Talmud.
This constraint arose out of the desire to ensure that all of the bases for divorce be adequate. Prior to this, people used such issues as incompatibility or a decline in lucidity as grounds; the court eventually came to see these problems as not severe enough to warrant divorce, however. In the 1970s, no-fault grounds gained favor in many states, and in 2010, New York became one of the last of the fifty states to allow no-fault divorces even in cases where there was no mutual consent to the divorce. The other states still requiring mutual consent for no-fault divorce are Tennessee (except where there are no minor children and the couple have lived apart for two years) and Mississippi.

Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kyiv bought Mykhalyk in the 2005–06 season, originally signing a five-year contract. He was almost immediately loaned off to Zakarpattia Uzhhorod. Mykhalyk has stated in an interview that he was really surprised to get a call from Dynamo Kyiv president Ihor Surkis inviting him to come and try out for the team, as he never even had any attention from scouts of his local Volyn Lutsk of the Ukrainian First League. Even more shocking was a call-up to the main Ukraine national football team by coach Oleh Blokhin not long afterward.
