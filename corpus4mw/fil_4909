The Board of Forestry publishes the "Forestry Program for Oregon" to guide forest management within the state. Since it was first published in 1977, "sustainability" has remained the forestry program’s central theme. On a statewide basis, sustainable forest management creates a healthy and diverse forest ecosystem that produces abundant timber and other forest products. Habitat to support healthy populations of native plants and animals is maintained. It ensures productive soil, clean water, clean air, and recreational opportunities are protected. This balanced program supports Oregon’s people and their communities both economically and socially. The "Forestry Program for Oregon" serves as a strategic guide for the Department of Forestry’s day-to-day management decisions.

Interferometry is the process of combining waves in such a way that they constructively interfere. That is to say that when two or more independent sources detect a signal at the same given frequency those signals can be combined and the result is better than each one individually. An overview of Astronomical interferometers and a History of astronomical interferometry can be referenced from their respective pages.
During World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (ex. depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact. These devices became much more accessible to the average fisherman, thus making their range and mobility increasingly larger. It also served to make the industry much more competitive, as the fisherman were forced to invest more into their boats and equipment in order to stay up to date with the current technology.
