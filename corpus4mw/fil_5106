Azad was born in Delhi in a highly educated Persian immigrant family. His mother died when he was four years old. His father, Muhammad Baqir (c.1810-1857), was educated at the newly founded Delhi College. Besides his many other activities he worked in the British administration. In early 1837, Muhammad Baqir bought a press and launched the "Dihli Urdu Akhbaar" (Delhi Urdu Newspaper), which was probably the first Urdu newspaper in north India. Muhammad Baqir was executed for siding with Mughals and joining the rebellion in 1857.
