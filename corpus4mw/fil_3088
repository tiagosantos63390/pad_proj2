Whereas the Browning SA-22's barrel tightening is accomplished with an adjusting ring at the base of the barrel (and can easily be seen) where it butts up against the receiver - the Remington Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism uses a dual-sided nut (with an interrupted-screw thread in the interior and a full thread cut into the exterior) riding inside the threaded hole in the front of the receiver (only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver). Selecting how deeply the dual-sided nut sits in the receiver (with the dual-sided nut's exterior thread meshing with the thread cut into the hole in the front of the receiver) controls how tightly the barrel fits against the receiver when it is attached (the rifle is assembled).
