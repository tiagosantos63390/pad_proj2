Despite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.

Carver noticed that board members often wonder what the board's job is and where the line distinguishing the Boards job from that of the Chief Executive Officer lies. Carver's model clarifies the separation by having the board explicitly state the Boards and CEO's jobs in a set of written policies (hence the name 'Policy Governance').
Darren became Larten Crepsley's vampire assistant after being forced to leave his family, and as to prevent suspicion, Darren faked his death, which was supervised and planned by Mr. Crepsley. Darren then joined Cirque du Freak with Mr. Crepsley.

At the circus, Darren became friends with Evra Von, a snake boy. He later finds out that Steve Through many dangerous and life-changing circumstances, Darren ends up dying and saving the fate of the world, dragging Steve with him. He is reincarnated by Mr. Tiny as a Little Person like Harkat. Throughout the novels, Darren keeps a diary. Darren travels back in time to the Cirque when he first went with Steve so that he can fix his past mistakes and never become a vampire. After the show, he scares off his past self when Steve is trying to make a deal with Larten Crepsley, thus withdraw his involvement in the story. Afterward, he gives his diary to Mr. Tall, instructing the latter to give it to his older, normal self, so that he will publish it as a fictional book (apparently the Darren Shan series itself) in hope one day the Vampire and Vampaneze would read the book and uncover Destiny's true face and scheme. In the end, Darren gets to live a normal life, and his alternative, vampire self becomes nonexistent and dies. Darren is portrayed by Chris Massoglia in the 2009 movie adaptation.
