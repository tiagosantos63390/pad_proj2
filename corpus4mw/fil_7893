The line branched from the Northern Railway in Bietigheim, running for 23 km until it reached a point between Weilern Eckenweiher Hof and Mühlacker. A station was built there, which would later be the end of a line from Pforzheim. Both settlements were to the south of the town of Dürrmenz. Experts of both countries criticized the route of the line because it prevented the important town of Vaihingen having a well-located station. Baden criticized the location of an important frontier station at a secluded farmhouse. On 1 October 1853 the Royal Württemberg State Railways ("Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen", KWSt.E.) opened the Western Railway. Unusually for Germany, the new station was named after the locality of Mühlacker, not after the community that it was part of.

Moraga was elected in 1967 regidor of Pichilemu, an office which he held until 1971 under Mayor Carlos Rojas Pavez. After the Chilean transition to democracy, Moraga has participated in several municipal elections. In 1992, he renounced the Christian Democrat Party of Chile, after he was not supported by his party to run in the municipal elections of that year; he ran as independent in 1996, but was not elected mayor nor councillor, obtaining only 229 (3.61%) from the 6,352 total votes. In the 2000, and 2004 municipal elections, he ran for mayor, unsuccessfully. In 2008, Moraga ran independently for councillor of Pichilemu, obtaining 629 (8.83%) from the 7,127 total votes (surpassing Marta Urzúa Púa — who was elected — for almost 500 votes), but was not elected. In 2012, he ran again for mayor, but lost against Roberto Córdova; Moraga obtained 469 votes, the 6.57 per cent from the total vote.
