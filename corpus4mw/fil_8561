Barker's perfect game was the first one in which designated hitters were used. He didn't reach a three-ball count in the entire game. Toronto shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who played for the losing team in this game, went on to play for the losers in the perfect games of Browning and Martínez. Also on the losing end of this game was Danny Ainge, who would play 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association. All 11 of Barker's strikeouts were swinging.

Two of the most critical points were Fånekleivi east of Byglandsfjorden, about 5 km south of Bygland and Byklestigen south of the village church in Bykle. Today's corridor runs in a tunnel at 611 feet through Fånefjell. Also at Byklestigen is the current road in tunnel.
The film opens in 19th century Mexico, where El Charro (Andrew Bryniarski) acts as a wealthy, but diabolical land baron who falls madly in love with a sweet, innocent ancestor of the protagonist Maria. She scorns him, which prompts El Charro to kill everyone she cares about. However, Maria's ancestor still refuses El Charro, who decides to put a curse on Maria's family line. Many years after, we are brought to the present day 21st century, where we are introduced to Maria (Drew Mia) and her friend Chris (Heidi Androl), who are roommates in college. It is a Friday or so, and Maria, who we learn is suffering from repeating nightmares of her sister's suicide, is coerced to go with Chris, and her friends, Tanya (Kathryn Taylor) and Rosemary (KellyDawn Malloy) to Chris' uncle's Arizona cottage for the weekend. However upon reaching Arizona, the group is persistently attacked by El Charro in the form of revant spirit with a machete. Eventually, El Charro kills every one of the girls except for Maria, who races toward a shrine of the archangel Michael (James Intveld). Using his heavenly abilities, Michael kills El Charro, and the curse is thus destroyed as well.

Gagnon's primary fields are Pauline theology and sexuality. In particular, Gagnon has focused on the issue of homosexuality in relation to Christianity and the Bible. Gagnon has been described as "the foremost traditionalist interpreter" on this topic, and has published several books and articles about the subject, such as "The Bible and Homosexual Practice", which has been called "one of the most cited works" on the subject.
Lamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and there was no evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Canadian Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.
