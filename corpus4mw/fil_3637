Jefferson continued to argue for cessation of the tribute, with rising support from George Washington and others. With the recommissioning of the American navy in 1794 and the resulting increased firepower on the seas, it became more and more possible for America to say "no", although by now the long-standing habit of tribute was hard to overturn. A largely successful undeclared war with French privateers in the late 1790s showed that American naval power was now sufficient to protect the nation's interests on the seas. These tensions led to the First Barbary War in 1801.

In 2010 Ian Wishart published the book "Arthur Allan Thomas". Wishart agrees with Birt in rejecting the murder-suicide theory. But contrary to Booth, Yallop and Birt he does not believe Jeannette’s father Len Demler had anything to do with the murders or removing the bodies after their deaths. Instead Wishart proposes two new suspects: the son of a prominent New Zealand family who worked in the area (Wishart does not directly name him); or one of the policemen who planted evidence to convict Thomas.

Another notable difference is the closed syllable, which has disappeared from the Manila dialect. The town of Tanauan is pronounced "tan-'a-wan", although it would be pronounced "ta-'na-wan" by other Tagalog speakers. This is also true of words such as "matamis" (pronounced "matam-is"). Because Batangan is more closely related to ancient Tagalog, the merger of the phonemes "e" and "i" and the phonemes "o" and "u" are prevalent; "e" and "o" are allophones of "i" and "u", respectively, in Tagalog.

Offaly surrendered their championship crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for "the Cats". Carey scored 2–4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5–15 to 1–14.
