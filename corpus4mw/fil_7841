Description and purpose.
Once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu's heir, Lady Saigō used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes. A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in Suruga province, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle. As she was quite near-sighted, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saigō died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified.

The past.
Since founding Walker's Run, Gilmore has created two other acts: Kantara, an Arab-Appalachian collaboration that earned him an award from the U.S. Secretary of State for its cultural impact. As Gilmore states: “A couple of old fiddle tunes have now become oud and darbouka tunes.” Kantara means "bridge" in Arabic. Most recently Gilmore founded Borden Grant, named for the provision of land by King George II of Great Britain on which Rockbridge County, Virginia was later situated.
