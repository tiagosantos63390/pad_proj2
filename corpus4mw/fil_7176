If both parents are carriers of a "BRCA" mutation, then pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is sometimes used to prevent the birth of a child with "BRCA" mutations. Inheriting two "BRCA1" mutations (one from each parent) has never been reported and is believed to be a lethal birth defect. Inheriting one "BRCA1" mutation and one "BRCA2" mutation has been reported occasionally; the child's risk for any given type of cancer is the higher risk of the two genes (e.g., the ovarian cancer risk from "BRCA1" and the pancreatic cancer risk from "BRCA2"). Inheriting two "BRCA2" mutations produces Fanconi anemia.
