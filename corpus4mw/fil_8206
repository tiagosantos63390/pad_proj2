The media reported in mid-October 2012 on DesJarlais divorce of his first wife, Susan, from 2001. During their divorce proceedings, Susan DesJarlais alleged that her ex-husband engaged in "violent and threatening behavior". Court filings revealed that he had an affair with a female patient, and pressured her to have an abortion after she became pregnant.

The DeltaWing was designed to reduce aerodynamic drag dramatically, to allow a marginally faster straight and corner speed than a 2009-2011 Dallara IndyCar on both ovals and road/street courses with half as much weight, engine power and fuel consumption. As the name suggests, it has a delta wing shape, with an unusually narrow front track and a more traditional rear track. The car lacks any front or rear wings - downforce comes from the underbody. In 2012, the engine was a four-cylinder turbocharged direct injection 300 bhp unit assembled by Ray Mallock Engineering with largely Chevrolet parts. The model to run at Le Mans had a fuel tank, bespoke BBS wheels and Michelin tyres, a weight of , a power-to-weight ratio of 631 brake horsepower per ton, and a drag coefficient of 0.35.

In the 1970s, the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform was led by David Norris, who campaigned for then-current criminalizations of homosexuality (namely those in force from 1861 and 1885) to be dismantled. In 1980, the case was taken before the Supreme Court of Ireland; losing the case, Norris took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 1988 against the Irish government. The laws were finally reformed in 1993 by then-Minister for Justice Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, due to Labour Party pressure.

Curiously, though it has been perceived as anti-war, Hamilton’s novel is actually an ardent and patriotic defense of the British war effort, with its most devastating critiques being against the home pacifist movement. Ridiculing English pacifists as being “self-centered,” Hamilton accuses them of walking “the pathways of the paradise of fools,” and of being unwilling and unable to recognize the necessity of war when it came. William Tully, the hapless protagonist of the story, goes through three distinct phases in his attitude toward war: 1.) naïve pacifism before the War; 2.) martial patriotism after the Germans kill his new bride; 3.) weary disillusion with his unappreciated role in the war effort. Though Tully does end up embittered against war in general, Hamilton never swerves from her dominant thesis that this disillusionment does not contradict the absolute rightness of the Allied war effort, a rightness justified by the implacable, inhuman menace of the German Empire. Just when the reader expects the story to turn against war in general, Hamilton assures us that Tully has not “drifted” back toward his “former” pacifism: “He hated the war as it affected himself, was weary of the war in general; all he longed for was its ending, which meant his release from imprisonment; but neither hatred nor weariness had blinded his eyes to the folly of that other blindness which had denied that war could be.”
