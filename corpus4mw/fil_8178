In March 1992, IROC drivers Dave Marcis and Dick Trickle were invited to test at the Speedway. At the time, the Speedway was considering hosting an IROC event during the month of May, during activities leading up the Indianapolis 500. The test was considered successful, but several improvements would have to be made to the track before it was safe for modern stock cars to race there. After consideration, it was determined that it would not be economically feasible to hold an IROC race at the time, and plans for that event were put on hold. Instead, the Speedway moved forward on plans to host a NASCAR race, the Brickyard 400, which would debut in 1994.

Another possible chapel site east of the Glaven was shown on an 1835 map, but there is no documentation to support that identification.

After Balchen had investigated the accident site from the plane, a party of five climbers started at 18:00 to climb the mountain side.
