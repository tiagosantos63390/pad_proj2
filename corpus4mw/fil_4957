`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels, probably the first Bahá'í to Brazil, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil, then Argentina and Uruguay before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.
The Indian 17th Division resumed the lead of the advance, and met a Japanese blocking force north of Pegu, north of Rangoon, on 25 April. The various line of communication troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Rangoon had been formed into the Japanese 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation used anti-tank mines improvised from aircraft bombs, anti-aircraft guns and suicide attacks with pole charges to delay the Indian division and then defended Pegu until 30 April, when it withdrew into the hills west of Pegu. The monsoon broke as the 17th Division resumed its advance on Rangoon, and floods slowed the division.

Earlier "Doc" Smith had written the first great novels of interstellar exploration, the Skylark (series), and later he created another sweeping multi-volume series about the Galactic Patrol in the Lensman series. But this story, "Spacehounds of IPC", stands alone. Although it has many similarities to the Lensmen series, the technology and the lifeforms in the story can't be reconciled with the universe of the Lensmen. It is possible that Smith may have been planning this story as the beginning of a new series, but he was never to return to this setting (mainly Jupiter and its moons) or to the characters in this story. The story was the first to use the term "tractor beam", a name and concept that has been adopted by many subsequent literary works of fiction and other media until present day.
For many years he also publicly feuded with another well known Marathi author Acharya Atre.

In 1807, with Floyd in custody and the plot exposed, Davis along with Burr and his other conspirators, were charged with treason. The treason could not be proved against Burr and the treason charges were dropped against Floyd. He was however charged a $20 fine and imprisoned for 3 hours. Some believe that Floyd was unaware of Burr's larger plot but much of the public at the time considered him a "conscientious traitor".
Well educated in the classics of the Arab and Classical world, and well versed in four languages (Arabic, the Fula language, Hausa and Tamacheq Tuareg), Nana Asma'u had a public reputation as a leading scholar in the most influential Muslim state in West Africa, which gave her the opportunity to correspond broadly.Mary Wren Bivins.

London: Heinemaan, 2007.</ref> She witnessed many of the wars of the Fulani War and wrote about her experiences in a prose narrative "Wakar Gewaye" "The Journey". As the Sokoto Caliphate began as a cultural and religious revolutionary movement, the writings of its leaders held a special place by which later generations, both rulers and ruled, could measure their society. She became a counselor to her brother when he took the Caliphate, and is recorded writing instructions to governors and debating with the scholars of foreign princes.

The French form "Arnaud" is recorded from the 10th century, and was also brought to England after the Norman conquest, where it replaced the cognate Anglo-Saxon form "Earnweald" (Doomsday Book "Ernehale"; "Ernaldus" 12th century). However, the Anglo-Norman given name did not survive into the modern period (other than in surnames, as "Arnall, Arnell"), and the German form "Arnold" was re-introduced in the Anglosphere in the 19th century.
