Gerald Teasdale Fowler (1 January 1935 â€“ 1 May 1993), was a British Labour Party politician and university academic.
He later moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where he died at the age of 91.
A 2014 perspective piece in the "New England Journal of Medicine" examined Wikipedia pages about 22 prescription drugs to determine if they had been updated to include the most recent FDA safety warnings. It found that 41% of these pages were updated within two weeks after the warning, 23% were updated more than two weeks later, and the remaining 36% had not been updated to include the warning as of more than 1 year later as of January 2014.
