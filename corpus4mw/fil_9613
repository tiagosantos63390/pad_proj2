Genetic patterns and protein expression can explain cellular behavior to a large extent, but the dynamic study of living cells can increase the understanding of the interconnecting molecular events continually taking place in each cell . Each cell is more or less different from the other, even within the same cell type. Cellular heterogeneity is well known in bacteria and increasingly apparent in eukaryotic cells. For a long time it was desired as well as assumed that cell cultures were of a homogeneous nature, and that analyzing a collection of cells would give an accurate assessment of the behavior of the cells in that culture or tissue. The average response of the cells was, and often still is, interpreted as the response of all cells in that sample. Additionally, the effect of cell number (signaling, interactions, etc.) on cell behavior was, and is still often, neglected due to difficulties in monitoring such detailed phenomena. The attitude to ensemble measurements is starting to change; today's researchers are increasingly aware of, hence interested to study, the resulting effects of heterogeneity in cell samples, as mirrored in recent reviews on single-cell analysis.

From 1961 to 1962, he published what has been called the "shortest-lived dance magazine in Canadian history". Called "The Canadian Dance World Magazine", Vesak and Slater published a total of six issues of the free 16-page magazine and distributed it to 300 individuals who were interested in dance. Each issue had its own theme including: men in dance, ethnic dance, religion in dance, symbolism, and leaders of the modern dance movement. He described the magazine as being "dedicated to the furtherance of dance" in Canada and he published it without attribution. Known for choreographing both classical and contemporary work, in 1963, Vesak debuted his choreographic work entitled Parenthesis, at the first Canadian Modern Dance Festival in Toronto. He also created works, such as "From Ecstasy to Despair" in 1969, that were described as futuristic and emotionally jarring, that provided an important social message. He was director of the San Francisco Opera ballet from 1970 to 1975. He was named official choreographer for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1975. Also in 1975, he was named director of the Metropolitan Opera ballet. He became one of the most internationally renowned choreographers of his time, having the rare distinction of being awarded two international gold medals for choreography in a single year, withhis broad range of work performed throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America.

The north and south "barrios," or quarters, of Wanuku Pampa were used mostly as residential districts. In some cases, the areas are very formally arranged, such as the "cuartel" in the northern "barrio", which to a European, appears just as an army barrack. Many Inca people lived in rectangular houses with trapezoidally-shaped niches in the interior walls. All of these houses are built from "pirqa" masonry, typically bifacial walls with rubble and mud fill. Many of these houses are arranged around a central courtyard.
As its name implies, "M. thermophila" is a thermophilic fungus, growing optimally at 38-45°C but not above 60°C. "Myceliophthora thermophila" colonies have been commonly isolated from composts, where they generate high temperatures from cellular activities. Moist, sun-heated soils and hay provide ideal places for "M. thermophila" growth because they do not easily dissipate heat and help insulate the colony. Due to the scarcity of soluble carbon sources at high temperatures, this species is well adapted to utilizing insoluble carbon sources for energy, such as cellulose and hemicellulose.
