Background.
Afterwards Braxton returned to the House of Burgesses, which thanked him and Thomas Jefferson for their service, although King William voters failed to reelect the absent Braxton as one of their delegates (so he missed the two sessions in 1778). Moreover, his house at Chericoke burned down shortly before Christmas, 1776, so Braxton moved his family to Grove House near West Point, Virginia (which itself burned down in 1903). Through most of his legislative career, Braxton was a political opponent of the Lee family (since its involvement in the Robinson Estate scandal), and he also became involved in a press quarrel with anti-slavery activist and diplomat Arthur Lee, supposedly concerning Silas Deane's mercantile and diplomatic activities. Between 1776 and 1785, Braxton served in 8 of the 11 legislative assemblies, and attended 14 of 21 sessions, with a special concern for debt and tax moratoriums or other relief.

A reasonable hypothesis is that the brain and the nervous system are biologically programmed to acquire language, either the first or the second in a particular sequence and in a particular mode.

"Force 10 from Navarone", MacLean's only sequel, picks up from where the film version of "The Guns of Navarone" leaves off, not his original novel. Otherwise MacLean eschewed inter-novel continuity, save for two minor instances of a character from one novel appearing in another – Colonel De Graaf from "Puppet on a Chain" reappeared in "Floodgate", and Professor Benson from "Goodbye California" making a second appearance in "Santorini".
