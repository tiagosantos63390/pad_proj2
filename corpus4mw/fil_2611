It was about giving the people around me the opportunity they deserved." Pegz used the label to create a distribution network, and also purchased the Zenith Records vinyl pressing plant, one of only two companies then still pressing vinyl records in Australia. The pressing plant was subsequently sold in November 2007.
Next, Kaji will be appearing in the film, "", which will star Kaji's costar from "Yankee Boukou ni Kaeru" and "Regatta", Shouta Matsuda, as the main character; with Kaji's "Seishun Energy: Check It Out Yo! in Tokyo" costar, Ryo Kimura and fellow D-Boys member, Yuu Shirota as supporting characters.
