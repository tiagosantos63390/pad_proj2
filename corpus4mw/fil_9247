Gibb became a close associate of Telford, working as contractor or resident engineer for him on various projects over a thirty year period; from 1817 he worked under Telford on works including harbours at Peterhead, Cullen, Banff, and Nairn. Whilst working for Telford Gibb was encountered by the poet Robert Southey, then touring Scotland, who described him as "".. that obliging, good-natured, useful and skilful man, Mr Gibb."". Gibb also became involved in the quarrying and supply of aberdeen granite, in association with the company of Messrs. Jolliffe and Banks, as well as surveying the River Dee at Chester, and worked on a turnpike road from Glasgow to Carlisle. In 1823 he began employment under Robert Stevenson on the construction of lighthouses, and from 1827 to 1829 worked under the Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges; his work included the construction of the Don bridge near Aberdeen.
