Supporting farmers in areas of food insecurity through such measures as free or subsidized fertilizers and seeds increases food harvest and reduces food prices.

In the 21st century some supersonic airliners and business jets (Aerion SBJ, HyperMach SonicStar, Next Generation Supersonic Transport, Tupolev Tu-444, Gulfstream X-54, LAPCAT, Reaction Engines A2, Spike S-512, Zero Emission Hyper Sonic Transport) were under development.

In its simplest form, it consists of an outer case with mirrors at each end set parallel to each other at a 45-degree angle.

The obverse shows a left-facing bust of the queen, with a rose behind her and the legend E D G ROSA SINE SPINA -- Elizabeth, by the grace of God a rose without a thorn—while the reverse shows the royal arms with the date above the arms and a mint mark at the beginning of the legend reading CIVITAS LONDON -- City of London, the Tower Mint.
As can be seen from the definition of the divided differences new data points can be added to the data set to create a new interpolation polynomial without recalculating the old coefficients. And when a data point changes we usually do not have to recalculate all coefficients. Furthermore if the "x""i" are distributed equidistantly the calculation of the divided differences becomes significantly easier. Therefore the Newton form of the interpolation polynomial is usually preferred over the Lagrange form for practical purposes, although, in fact (and contrary to widespread claims), Lagrange, too, allows calculation of the next higher degree interpolation without re-doing previous calculations—and is considerably easier to evaluate.
