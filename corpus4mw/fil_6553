In this early period many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and there was a cross-pollination between garage rock and frat rock, sometimes viewed as merely a sub-genre of garage rock.

Zimmer in the case of real hyperelliptic function fields. It was extended to certain cubic function fields of unit rank one by R. Scheidler and A. Stein. In 1999, S. Paulus and H.-G.

Sunstar tells Bluefur that he was planning to make her ThunderClan’s new deputy, because of the current deputy retiring, but since she was having kits, he was thinking about letting Thistleclaw become the deputy instead. Bluefur knows that allowing Thistleclaw to become deputy and then leader would be extremely deadly to the Clan (she saw him in a vision dripping with blood), Bluefur takes her three kits to Oakheart, where they would be raised in RiverClan. On the way, one of them, Mosskit, a gray-and-white she-kit, dies because of the freezing snow. When she returns, she pretends that a starving predator had taken her kits. Bluefur is made deputy, and learns that Sunstar only received eight lives from StarClan because Pinestar had not died yet. After Sunstar loses his final life, she becomes leader, receiving her own nine lives and leader name (Bluestar). After successfully leading ThunderClan for several seasons, she receives another prophecy from the current ThunderClan medicine cat, Spottedleaf: “Fire alone can save our Clan.”, which puzzles Bluestar.
