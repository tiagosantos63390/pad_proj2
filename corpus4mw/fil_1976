Following a move from Motown to Epic Records, the group was renamed The Jacksons, and embarked on another tour of Europe, where they performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II. After their Interim concert series in 1978, the siblings proceeded with the Destiny Tour, a promotional platform for their similarly named album. Their 1981 36-city circulation of the US—the Triumph Tour—came next. The Jacksons' final tour together was in 1984, following the release of two albums: the band's "Victory" and Michael Jackson's "Thriller". The Victory Tour spanned 55 performances in the US and Canada and grossed over $75 million.
In order to use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, artificial badger dens were built, captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would be placed in a box, which was furnished in imitation of its den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of the badger puts his animal in the box. The timekeeper is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger lets it slide into the tunnel. Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites, tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner of the dog quickly pulls out the dog whose jaws are clamped obstinately onto the badger by its tail. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den. Then the dog is sent back in to seize the badger and it again is drawn out with the badger. This scene is repeated over and over again. The more often a dog is able to seize the badger within a minute, so that both can be pulled out together, the more it is up to the task and is considered game.
