The first 15 minutes were very even as both teams probed each other's try line and each team made a couple of breaks but good cover defence soon rubbed out any threat of a try. However in the 19th minute a break from James Roby (from a Chris Hill offload) set England up in a good position. First they tried a sweeping move to the right only for Gareth Ellis to be shut down, then a sweeping move to the left saw Sam Tomkins place a delicate grubber kick through the defence for Zak Hardaker to pounce on to score the game's first try. Captain Kevin Sinfield converted to make it 6-0. Another try for England soon followed as the Exiles tried to attack the England line only for Leroy Cudjoe to shoot up and shut Brett Hodgson down who lost the ball. Sinfield picked the loose ball up and offloaded to James Roby who then sprinted 80m to score under the posts. Sinfield converted to make it 12-0. The first half was dominated by England and they showed their dominance as Rangi Chase made a break down the left before being tackled. Then a few passes to the right saw Richie Myler put Gareth Ellis through a gap, he then offloaded to Cudjoe who produced an outrageous dummy to Exiles fullback Hodgson which left Cudjoe to stroll over for a try. Sinfield converted to make it 18-0. Sinfield made a break from dummy half in the 34th minute and found Sam Tomkins in support who sprinted 50m to score under the sticks. Sinfield converted to give his team a 24-0 advantage at half time.
September 18 of the year 96 A.D. A perfect plan. A day designed to write the story. But everything goes wrong. Then we only improvise: a civil war, the Colosseum, the Praetorian Guard and border wars, poisonings, informers and poets, fighting in sand, Christians and martyrs, executions, the last disciple of Christ and the Apocalypse, the rise and fall of an imperial dynasty. Marcus Ulpius Trajan, the promotion of a new dynasty and thirty five years of Roman history .September 18, year 96 AD. A group of gladiators. Nothing can stop them. Even the story.
After the fall of Landrecies the Austrians did nothing for eleven days, as if they had forgotten why the fortress had been taken in the first place. Only on 12 May did operations of the combined Austro-Dutch forces resume near Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis. A chance to cut off Pichegru was missed, however, because of hesitation by the Emperor. This did not bode well for the remainder of the campaign. Indeed the tide eventually turned in favor of the French and they retook Landrecies on 17 July 1794 after a brief siege.
