The world to come, age to come, or heaven on Earth are eschatological phrases reflecting the belief that the "current world" or "current age" is flawed or cursed and will be replaced in the future by a better world or age or paradise. The concept is related but differs from the concepts of heaven, the afterlife, and the Kingdom of God in that "heaven" is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the "afterlife" is generally an individual's life after death, and the "Kingdom of God" could be in the present (such as Realized eschatology) or the future (such as Futurism (Christianity)). All of these may also be characterized as otherworlds or possible worlds.
The Dacre, Hungerford, Lacy, Shakespeare, and Tristram knots are all considered variations of the Bowen knot, and are sometimes blazoned as such.
