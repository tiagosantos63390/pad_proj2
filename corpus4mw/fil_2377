In 1974, there were rumors that Hunter forgeries were being sold by William J. Toye in New Orleans. Decades later, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) investigated reports of forgery of Hunter's works and raided the home of Toye in September 2009. Toye, who was accused of selling forged paintings three times over the course of four decades, pleaded guilty in federal court on June 6, 2011. Others, including a relative of Hunter's and one of Henry's have forged Hunter's artwork as well, though Whitehead says Toye's fakes were the best. His forgeries were painted on vintage board and his brush strokes and monogram were good replicas of Hunter's, however Hunter normally left smudges on the backs of her work and marred the edges, distinguishing marks missing from Toye's counterfeits. Whitehead said that unlike the work of European masters, which generally has well-documented provenance, Hunter produced thousands of paintings, which she sold from her front door. Also, collectors spending millions are more prone to research the history of their prospective purchases than folk art collectors spending much less. The price for Hunter paintings range between a few thousand dollars to $20,000 according to Whitehead.

Newspaper career.
One problem critics identified is the blind spot created by the gap between the Nintendo DS's two screens. IGN accepts that this blind spot is necessary for aiming eggs properly but still describe it as "bothersome." GameSpy's reviewer calls it "a pain" and expresses frustration at being hit by an enemy hiding in this gap. On the whole, reviewers were pleased with the way the extra babies have been implemented, but IGN felt that Baby Wario was "a last minute addition that wasn't tested properly." They call his magnet "wonky," and says it "misses items that are right next to him."

During the 1968 season, several homeowners along Pole Cat Road, near Concordville, complained of the noise and smell of steam locomotives coming across their yards. They pressured the current landlord, the Penn Central Transportation Company (PC), who opted not renew the Wawa and Conconcordville’s lease when it expired in 1968. Not wanting to give up, the owners of the W&C continued to renegotiate a lease even after they were forced to halt operations.

Jews were living here as early as at Nájera, and they suffered greatly in the civil war between Peter of Castile and Henry II of Castile. On October 15, 1369, at the request of the directors of the small aljama of San Millán, whose cause was advocated by "certain Jews who were received at court," Henry II of Castile ordered that "the Christian men and women and the Moorish men and women" should immediately discharge all their debts to the Jews, "that the last-named might be able to pay their taxes the more promptly." On September 10, 1371, however, the king released the abbot and all the monks of San Millán from whatever debts they had contracted with the Jews since the Battle of Nájera.

Typically, the backbone is thought to be one of the most conserved parts of the skeleton. Why the hero shrew did not follow this pattern has presented a significant puzzle. Prior to 2013, there was no satisfactory explanation for adaptive advantage of the strong spine. In 1974, Jonathan Kingdon suggested that the robust spine and associated posture keeps the animal’s body clear of wet ground in swampy habitats. An alternate idea was that the intricate spine somehow evolved as the consequence of some unrelated adaptive factor, as in the spandrels of St. Marco hypothesis. Neither idea had strong scientific support. In 1998, Dennis Cullinane and his colleagues undertook an extensive survey of hero shrew's anatomy and concluded there was no obvious functional significance for the adaptation.
