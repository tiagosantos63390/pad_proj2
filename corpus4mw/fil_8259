Louis Winter was the youngest of six children, who attended Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto where he made the honour roll before being accepted into the biochemistry program at the University of Toronto. Shortly after Louis graduated from university with a Masters Degree in Biochemistry, he borrowed $10,000 from his father Abraham, and opened his first venture in 1948 called Winter Laboratories. The business was based in the family's garage processing blood work and pregnancy tests for local pharmacies, doctors' offices and medical clinics. With just his school mate, Toby Johansen, to handle initial sales, the company quickly outgrew its space and moved into a home near the University of Toronto's main campus. The business eventually expanded and Winter Laboratories leased the basement of the Mothercraft Building on Bloor Street, where Rochdale College would later be built and eventually open in 1968.
