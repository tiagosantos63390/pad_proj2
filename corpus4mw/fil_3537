At the end of Season 2, Zack receives a request from the office of the President to ship out to Iraq. What his duties there would be is not revealed, and he only tells Hodgins and Booth about it. He is indecisive and asks Booth for advice as Booth "knows more about duty and honor than anyone else I know". Zack also turns down the offer to be the Best Man at Hodgins and Angela's wedding in case he decides to go to Iraq and is killed, because he does not want Hodgins' memories of the wedding to be tainted with sadness, but Zack is later seen at the wedding. It is revealed in Episode 1 of Season 3 that Zack had just returned from a three-month stint in Iraq, having returned early because he "failed to assimilate."

"Teardrops on My Guitar" is a song by American country pop singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut studio album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" (2008), and released as the third single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Some critics have queried the song's classification as country music.
