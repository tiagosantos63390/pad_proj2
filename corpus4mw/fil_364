A short inscription which could be in Mysian and which dates from between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC was found in "Üyücek", near Kütahya, and seems to include Indo-European words, but it has not been deciphered.
The USPD was continued as an independent party by Georg Ledebour and Theodor Liebknecht, who refused to work with the SPD, but it never attained any significance again and merged into the "Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschland" (SAPD, Socialist Workers' Party of Germany) in 1931.
One-Elevens remained in widespread use with European operators into the 1990s. Once retired from major operators, they were often sold to smaller airlines, often in the Far East and Africa; Nigeria was a major operator until the type was grounded after a crash in 2002. A major factor for the withdrawal from European service of remaining One-Elevens was the Stage III noise abatement regulations, which came into effect from March 2003. Bringing the Rolls-Royce Spey engines into compliance with the noise regulations with hush kits was expensive and many European operators chose to dispose of the type from their fleets instead. In 2010, the European Aviation Safety Agency accepted an Airbus request to revoke the Type Certificate for the BAC One-Eleven. As a result BAC One-Eleven aircraft registered in any EU Member State are no longer eligible for a Normal Certificate of Airworthiness. In December 2012, the last operational One-Eleven in the UK, that had continued to fly as a military aircraft, was retired.

A local board of health (urban sanitary district) was formed for Chesterton in 1880, becoming Chesterton urban district under the Local Government Act 1894. This was abolished in 1912, with the urban area becoming part of the municipal borough of Cambridge, and the larger but less populous rural part forming part of the Milton parish.

Nonetheless, Steve is kind, bears no hatred for anyone, and is extremely loyal to the Winslow family, whom he is always ready to be there for. He would always be ready to forgive the Winslows when they take advantage of him, behave coldly towards him, harshly reject him and then learn that they hurt his feelings. Steve loves the Winslows like they were his real family, and whether through kindness, persistence or force, he is seen working tirelessly to become as much a part of their lives as a genuine family member.

Two "complete" recordings of the opera have been made: the first in 1978, released on the Tomato label (TOM-4-2901) in 1979, and later on CBS Masterworks followed by Sony Classical (both M4K 38875); the second in 1993, released that same year on the Nonesuch label (79323). The 1978 recording was held to 160 minutes in order to fit onto four LP records, i.e., the opening scene's repeats were considerably shortened. The 1993 recording encompassed 190 minutes, freed by the technology of the compact disc, although it was released on "three" CDs instead of the original's four. It is worth noting that the original instrumentation was revised for the 1993 recording, most notably the replacement of the Farfisa organ.

Lowell's next book of original verse "For the Union Dead" (1964) was widely praised, particularly for its title poem, which invoked Allen Tate's "Ode to the Confederate Dead." Helen Vendler states that the title poem "honors not only the person of Civil War hero Robert Gould Shaw, but also the stern and beautiful memorial bronze bas-relief Shaw and the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. . . which stands opposite the Boston State House." "For the Union Dead" was Lowell's first book since "Life Studies" to contain all original verse (since it did not include any translations), and in writing the poems in this volume, Lowell built upon the looser, more personal style of writing that he had established in the final section of "Life Studies". Lowell also wrote about a number of world historical figures in poems like "Caligula," "Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts," and "Lady Raleigh's Lament," and he combined personal and public concerns in poems like the title poem and "Fall 1961" which addressed Lowell's fear of nuclear war during the height of the Cold War.
Gija Joseon (?–194 BC) describes the period after the arrival of Gija in the Korean peninsula. It was considered by most of the Chinese and the Korean scholars as a part of the Gojoseon period (2333?–108 BC) of Korean history. Today, it is generally rejected as a later embellishment in Korean nationalist historiography while it is still accepted by Chinese and other historians.
