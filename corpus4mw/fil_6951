A quarrel with Sir William Fitzwilliam, who had succeeded Sidney as Lord Deputy of Ireland, in relation to Richard Burke, Earl of Clanricarde's imprisonment, occurred. After six months of imprisonment Clanricarde was released, whereupon he showed his loyalty by hanging his own son, his brother's son, his cousin-german's son, one of the captains of his own galloglasses and fifty of his followers that bore armour and weapons. Fitton meanwhile was besieged within Athlone Castle and requested reinforcement or to be relieved of his government. In early 1572, Athlone Castle was burnt to the ground, and Fitton was recalled to Dublin where the office of Lord President of Connaught and Lord President of Thomond were put into abeyance.
