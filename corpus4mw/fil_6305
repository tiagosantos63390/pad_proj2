"Eleocharis rostellata" is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing up to 1.2 meters tall with spongy, compressible stems. The stem bends and droops and if the tip touches moist soil it may root there and grow more stems. The plant also reproduces by seed and vegetatively by sprouting from bits of rhizome. The inflorescence is a single spikelet up to 2 centimeters long made up of many tiny flowers covered in light brown, sometimes purple-spotted bracts.
During the film's launch in China, the Hollywood blockbuster "Avatar" was reportedly going to be pulled from nearly 1,600 2-D screens across China, to benefit the wide release of this film. Instead, "Avatar" showings continued in the fewer, but more popular 900 3-D screens throughout China, which generated over 64% of the film's total ticket sales in China. The Hong Kong newspaper "Apple Daily" speculates that the Chinese authorities were worried "Avatar" had seized the market share from domestic films and noted that many of the vacant cinema slots will be replaced by "Confucius", and the film would be "drawing unwanted attention to the sensitive issue" concerning forced evictions of Chinese homes. However, China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television responded by stating it was a "commercial decision", and because the "box office performance of the 2D version has not been great." However, due to low attendance for "Confucius", and high demand for "Avatar", the Chinese government reversed their decision, and allowed "Avatar" to remain on some 2-D screens in China. This choice appeared to be at least partly based on the financial performance of the two films, with "Avatar" grossing nearly 2.5 times more money per day.

Sealpox is a cutaneous condition caused by parapoxvirus, usually affecting seal handlers who have been bitten by infected harbor or grey seals. First identified in 1969, it wasn't unequivocally proven to be transmissible to humans until 2005, though such transmission had been reported at least as early as 1987. It “causes lesions very similar to orf.” As many as 2% of seals in marine mammal rehabilitation facilities in North America may have it.

Just as a woman loves her husband, so the city of Toledo loved you. In combat your shield never turned away, and your spear never turned back. Your sword always achieved great victories. Do not announce his death in Córdoba and Sevilla, nor in the house of King Texufin, lest the daughters of the Saracens rejoice, and the daughters of Toledo be saddened.
