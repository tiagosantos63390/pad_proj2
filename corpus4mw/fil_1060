In October 1914 "E11", under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Martin Nasmith, was dispatched to the Baltic Sea along with two other submarines, but was twice intercepted by German patrols, and forced to return to Harwich. During the Scarborough Raid in December 1914, the "E11" attempted to intercept the German battlecruisers, but failed due to faulty torpedoes.

The types of air cycle machines may be identified as:
A variety of substituted derivatives of phen have been examined as ligands. Neocuproine, 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, is a bulky ligand. In "bathophenanthroline," the 4 and 7 positions are substituted by phenyl groups. The more electron-rich phenanthroline ligand is 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline.
Formerly generally recognized as safe (GRAS), after a hiatus anethole was reaffirmed by Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) as GRAS. The hiatus was due to concerns about liver toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity, reported in rats. Anethole is associated with a slight increase in liver cancer in rats, although the evidence is scant and generally regarded as evidence that anethole is "not" a carcinogen. An evaluation of anethole by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) found its notable pharmacologic properties to be reduction in motor activity, lowering of body temperature, and hypnotic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant effects. A subsequent evaluation by JECFA found some reason for concern regarding carcinogenicity, but there is currently insufficient data to support this. At this time, the JECFA summary of these evaluations is that anethole has "no safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavoring agent".
