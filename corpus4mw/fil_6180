Justus H. Vinton (17 February 1806 – 31 March 1858) was an American Baptist missionary who labored for 25 years in Burma (now known as Myanmar) preaching the gospel amongst the Karen people. He had boundless energy and was pre-eminently a man of revival power and was most adored, respected and venerated by the natives as well as the British civil and military residents.

Vestibulospinal tracts: The importance is involved in the control of postural adjustments and head movements as well as balance maintenance. Any movement of the body is detected by the vestibular sensory neurons, and the sensory motor replies by counteracting the movements through the vestibulospinal tracts and exerting action on a group of muscles throughout the body. The lateral vestibulospinal tract excites antigravity muscles in order to exert control over postural changes necessary to compensate for tilts and movements of the body. The medial vestibulospinal tract innervates neck muscles in order to stabilize head position as one moves around the world.
