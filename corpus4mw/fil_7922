One of the standards for Anti-Bacterial is the ISO 22196:2007, which is based on the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS), code Z2801. This is one of the standards most often referred to in the industry with regards to tests on microbial activities (specifically bacteria) and in the JIS Z2801, two bacteria species are used as a standard, namely "E. Coli" and "Staphylococcus aureus". However, some companies may have the initiative to test more than just these two bacteria and may also replace "Staphylococcus aureus" with MRSA, the methicillin-resistant version of the same bacteria.

Chrysopsis floridana is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family, known by its common name, Florida golden aster. It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is known from Hillsborough, Hardee, Manatee, and Pinellas Counties. It is considered an endemic of the west-central coast of the state in the general vicinity of Tampa Bay. There are 17 to 20 occurrences, many of which have few individuals, but one of which has over one million plants. In 1986 the plant was added to the US endangered species list because it was becoming increasingly rare, it was growing only on private property, and its habitat was unprotected and being destroyed and degraded by a number of forces. It is found at Bell Creek Nature Preserve in Riverview, Florida.
Other government efforts include targeting the most in need for proper education, with two specially designed programmes. One is fee-frees schools, institutions that receive all their required funding from the state and so they do not have to charge such fees.

In the Duplication- Degeneration- Complementation (DDC) model of subfunctionalization both gene copies are needed to perform the original ancestral function. In this model after a duplication event, both paralogs suffer deleterious mutations leading to functional degradation. This degradation is so severe that neither gene copy can perform the ancestral function or any subset of that function independently. In order to be functional, the paralogs must work together to perform the ancestral task. This team work among paralogs is possible because the subfunction lost in one gene copy is complimented in the other gene copy. This functional sharing would not be possible if both paralogs had lost identical subfunctions.
The 1st Battalion 32nd Field Artillery Regiment "Proud Americans" was a Lance Missile battalion garrisoned at Fliegerhorst Kaserne in the Erlensee area of Hanau, West Germany from 1960 when it was activated as an Honest John unit. 1st Battalion later became a Lance battalion about 1976 through 1992 when it became part of 3rd Armored Division, VII Corps and returned to Fort Sill to become a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) unit which it remains today. 1/32 FA consisted of 5 Batteries: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Headquarters, and Service Batteries, and was deactivated in 1992 as a Lance Missile unit and reactivated as a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) unit. The unit patch worn was the 41st FA Brigade which was under V Corps Artillery until August 1991 when it joined 3rd Armored Division (Spearhead) and adopted its patch before returning to Fort Sill in 1992 to become a MLRS battalion.
