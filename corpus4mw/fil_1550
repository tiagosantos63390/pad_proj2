A NLFSR (Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register) is a common component in modern stream ciphers, especially in RFID and smartcard applications. NLFSRs are known to be more resistant to cryptanalytic attacks than Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). It is known how to generate a "n"-bit NLFSR of maximal length "2n", generating a De Bruijn sequence, by extending a maximal-length LFSR with "n" stages; but the construction of other large NLFSRs with guaranteed long periods remains an open problem. Using bruteforce methods, a list of maximum-period "n"-bit NLFSRs for n < 25 has been made as well as for n=25 and n=27
