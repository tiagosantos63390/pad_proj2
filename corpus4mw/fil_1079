Gabriel Lan is a member of the Xandarian Nova Corps and the captain of the diplomatic and exploratory spaceship "Way-Opener". Returning from a mission in space, the Way-Opener was confronted by the vessel of the cosmic entity Galactus, who abducts Lan and offers to transform him into a herald, in a similar fashion to the Silver Surfer.

The reasons for Tymiński's unexpected success remain unclear. Tymiński promised to create wealth for everyone quickly, and had an image as a patriotic Pole who had "made it" abroad. He was well received at a time when radical political changes were taking place, but the overall economic situation was getting worse. Many people were increasingly disappointed with the trench warfare that had broken out within the former anti-communist opposition, making the unknown but seemingly honest and patriotic candidate appealing.

In order to put the city in a position to possibly upgrade to AA level ball, in the early 1990s the minor league club owners began lobbying for a new ballpark. Their efforts finally succeeded in the early 2000s, and the new First Horizon Park (now known as NewBridge Bank Park) opened just north of the downtown in the spring of 2005.
A Surtax was levied on the corporation surtax net income (i.e., net income less allowances and exemptions) of corporations as shown in the following table.
French's division arrived near Allatoona at sunrise on October 5. After a two-hour artillery bombardment by twelve Confederate manufactured 12 pounder brass Napoleon guns of Myrick's Artillery Battalion manned by men of Capt. Alcide Bouanchaud's Battery Pointe Coupee Artillery), (Louisiana), Capt. James J. Cowan's Battery of Warren County, Mississippi and Capt. Robert L. Barry's Battery (Lookout Artillery, Tennessee Volunteers)]. French sent a demand for surrender, which Corse refused. French then launched his brigades in an attack—Sears from the north (against the rear of the fortifications) and Cockrell, supported by Young, from the west.
If the suspect chose to confess their guilt and abjure, they would do so in a public ceremony, usually at the gate of the church grounds. They would surrender their possessions to the church, and any landed property to the crown. The coroner, a medieval official, would then choose a port city from which the fugitive should leave England (though the fugitive sometimes had this privilege). The fugitive would set out barefooted and bareheaded, carrying a wooden cross-staff as a symbol of protection under the church. Theoretically they would stay to the main highway, reach the port and take the first ship out of England. In practice, however, the fugitive could get a safe distance away, abandon the cross-staff and take off and start a new life. However, one can safely assume the friends and relatives of the victim knew of this ploy and would do everything in their power to make sure this did not happen; or indeed that the fugitive never reached their intended port of call, becoming a victim of vigilante justice under the pretense of a fugitive who wandered too far off the main highway while trying to "escape."
The Ondes Martenot is also more audible in live versions, thanks to the addition of guitarist Ed O'Brien, who both doubles and expands on Greenwood's parts. Thom Yorke also adds scat singing during some performances. Unlike the studio recorded version on "Kid A", the live version of the song is often not performed with a brass section and is replaced with guitar played by Yorke in a stop-start rhythm.
On February 19, 2008, almost three years to the day after her kidnapping and murder, Jessica's father was represented by Jacksonville, Florida lawyers in a pre-trial brief filed against the Citrus County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After receiving notice of the pending suit, Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy stated that he believed the case to be ""baseless... There is only one person in the world that should be held responsible for Jessica Lunsford's death and that's John Couey."" 
"The Curse of the Cat People", which began production at the RKO Gower Street studios in Hollywood on 26 August 1943 and stopped on 4 October of that year, with additional shooting in the week of 21 November, marked two directorial debuts. Gunther von Fritsch had only directed short subjects to that time, so the film marked his feature debut, but when he fell behind schedule, having gotten only halfway through the screenplay in the 18 days of filming that had been allocated, the studio assigned film editor Robert Wise to take over, which earned him his first directorial credit. When it wrapped, the film, which had done some location shooting at Malibu Lake, California, was nine days behind schedule, and had cost so much that its budget was raised from $147,000 to $212,000. As was usual with Lewton's films, the tight budget demanded the re-use of sets, here from Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons" (1942), as had already been done with the predecessor "Cat People".
He was a spectrum specialist. In 1896, he suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element and he isolated europium in 1901. In 1898 he used his skills of spectroscopy to help Marie Curie confirm that she had discovered the element radium.
Rawdon has a conservation area called Little London which lies to the westernmost area of Rawdon. Little London conservation area is unique in that the historic area covered by the designation straddles the boundary of the district and one of its neighbours, Bradford. This area was, until the local government reorganisation in 1974, part of a district called Aireborough which was arbitrarily divided between Leeds and Bradford during reorganisation.
