Rudy Kurniawan (born 1976, in Jakarta, Indonesia) is a wine collector (called in 2007 the possessor of "arguably the greatest cellar on Earth") and convicted perpetrator of wine fraud. He was arrested on March 8, 2012 and indicted for allegedly selling fraudulent wine at auction. Allegedly, Kurniawan was buying large stocks of negociant Burgundy and re-labeling them as more expensive wines, such as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. He famously consigned several lots of Clos St. Denis from Domaine Ponsot from vintages long prior to any recorded production of Ponsot wines from that vineyard; the auction lots were withdrawn prior to bidding.
