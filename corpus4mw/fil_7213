In general appearance, especially when seen on the wing, "A. parthenope" is similar to "A. imperator" but "A. parthenope" tends to hold its abdomen straighter than "A. imperator". A large dragonfly seen in flight with a bent abdomen is most likely to be "A. imperator" rather than "A. parthenope".

It is similar to "A. ephippiger" although "A. ephippiger" is slightly smaller and slenderer and its blue saddle does not wrap around S2 but is mostly blue on top. "A. ephippiger" has brown eyes.
