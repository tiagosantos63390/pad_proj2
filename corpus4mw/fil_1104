Bytowners had been promoting their town as the capital of Canada since the 1840s. At the time the town's only connections with the world were via dirt road or by using the Ottawa River to Montreal.

Polish politics was under the strong influence of the statesman Józef Piłsudski, who envisioned a Polish-led federation (the "Federation of Międzymorze") comprising Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine and other Central and East European countries now emerging out of the crumbling empires after the First World War. The new union would have had borders similar to those of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 15th–18th centuries, and it was to be a counterweight to, and restraint upon, any imperialist intentions of Russia or Germany. To this end, Polish forces set out to secure vast territories in the east. However Piłsudski's federation plan was opposed by another influential Polish politician, Roman Dmowski, who favoured creating a larger, national Polish state.

After local operations and repairs, "Wrangell" sailed for her second Mediterranean deployment in the autumn. At 1014 on 4 October 1953 — while en route from Reykjavík, Iceland, to Bizerte, Tunisia, in company with the oiler — the ammunition ship sighted a fishing vessel flying international distress signals. "Wrangell" maneuvered near the drifting vessel and lowered a boat with a boarding party, Ens. P. R. Frosell in charge. "Wrangell's" men found the fishing boat, "Jules Verne" (registered at Douarnenez, France), to have wreckage strewn about topside and two feet of water in her engine compartment. The investigation also revealed the only living occupant of the craft to be a dog; the boarding party also found the corpse of a man estimated to have been dead for five days. Leaving food and water for the dog, the boarding party soon returned to the ship, and "Wrangell" took "Jules Verne" under tow. At 1403 the next day, 5 October, "Jules Verne" began to founder, however, and sank eight minutes later; the dog, swimming in the water, was hauled on board "Wrangell", whose crew adopted the animal and made him the ship's mascot.

Historically, craft was the pre-capitalist form of production, where each created item possessed a "use-value," a term comparing the usefulness of an item to the exchange equivalent. Now within a capitalist system of mass production, craft has become a commodity to be bought and sold for money, where it is now referred to as having an "exchange-value". Due to this movement from use-value to exchange-value, there is less emphasis on the time and skill expended to create an object, and more importance on making it available to the masses as inexpensively as possible. Traditionally associated with a strong community so vital to the creation and distribution of craft, crafting has since lost its use-value and has been "captured by capital".
