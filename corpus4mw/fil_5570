Catherine Cadière was born to a merchant, whose health was ruined by the plague in 1720, and lived under the guardianship of her mother and brothers. She was interested in mysticism and religion, and became deeply influenced by the Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Girard (1680-1733), whom she met in 1728. She was encouraged to the belief that she suffered from holy convulsions and saintly stigmata and spiritual visions by Girard, who presented it to be the symptoms of a saint. He visited her often, and possibly abused her sexually. Her emotional state during these experiences was described as hysterical.

Background.
Long term effects of this displacement and repurposing linger in the refugees, their families and subsequent generations, effectively reshaping the cultural and economic dynamic of an entire society. This has a ripple effect on their culture and people for generations to come. The use and conservation of a resource is a direct link to conflicts in Africa According to Abiodun Alao, author of “Natural Resources and Conflict in Africa”, natural resources can be linked to conflicts in three different ways: either a direct or remote conflict is caused by the resource, or a natural resource can fuel or sustain conflicts, and lastly when resources have been used to resolve conflicts. Often, the conservation efforts that commandeer indigenous people’s land remove the natives from a familiar social environment and transplant them into unknown quarters and customs. By doing so, traditional values such as “songs, rituals, …and stories” could be entirely lost in little more than one generation’s progression (Dowie, 2005). Economically, relocation and displacement can be devastating on a personal and communal level. Indigenous peoples of all intra-culture class types are forced to the boundaries of the new parks, stripped of their homes and status, and sometimes made to live in “shabby squatter camps…without running water or sanitation” (Dowie, 2005). This leads to even more added tension between conservation administrators and the new conservation refugees.

The Digital Quran is the electronic version of the Qur'an, introduced as early as 1993. There is a strict code of conduct for handling the written Qur'an, which limits its accessibility, especially in situations such as traveling or everyday reading on the move. The invention of the Digital Qu'ran addressed these limitations, in particular due to the on-screen text feature. While some limitations still apply, the portability of the device meant that people could read and listen to the Qur'an in places and situations where it had previously been impossible to do so.

The LB-5 was a member of the family of closely related bomber designs that had debuted with the XLB-1 in 1923, and as such, was a large, single-bay, conventional biplane. Like most of the family, it was a twin-engine machine, with engines mounted in nacelles on the lower wing. The prototype XLB-5 had a single tail fin like the XLB-1, the 10 LB-5 production machines were designed with a triple-finned tail under the Huff-Daland name, but the final batch of 25 was redesigned with twin tails and designated LB-5A.

With a young core that included Linden, Bure and McLean still in their twenties after the 1994 playoffs, the Canucks appeared poised to remain contenders in the league. However, the team failed to record a winning season in the six years following their Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Prior to the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Quinn stepped down as head coach to focus on his managerial duties and was replaced by Rick Ley; Vancouver finished with a .500 record that year. Their elimination from the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs in Game 4 of the second round marked the Canucks' last game played at the Pacific Coliseum, as the team moved into the General Motors Place (since renamed Rogers Arena), a new $160 million arena situated in Downtown Vancouver, the following season.
