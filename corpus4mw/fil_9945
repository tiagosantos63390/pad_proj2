The mining camp was first settled in 1876. It was first a placer mining camp, with the primary source of gold being nearby Elk Creek. The town nearly disappeared after the Uncle Sam Mine was shut down in 1880, and a forest fire destroyed a large portion of the town. The grand reopening of Roubaix and its official recognition as a town was marked by a celebration in August 1885 at a beer hall, complete with a dance. In the years following 1891, due to failed mining activity, the town nearly became abandoned. In 1899, Roubaix had 500 residents, a post office, several stores, a hospital, boarding houses, a newspaper, a barber shop, a few churches, and its own city hall. There was once a typhoid fever epidemic in the area. The town was home to several organizations, including a tennis club, literature group, whist club, and a miners' union. Before the early 1900s, there was no designated school building, and classes were held in various buildings around camp.
