Ājīvika is thought to be contemporaneous to other early Indian nāstika philosophical schools of thought, such as Cārvāka, Jainism and Buddhism. While the early nāstika systems such as Cārvāka and Ājīvika gradually became extinct or evolved into others, the Jain and Buddhist traditions spun off into what may be described today as separate religions, distinct from Hinduism (which is now restrictively meant to encompass only the six orthodox "Āstika" philosophical systems).

Albini further explained that, while he takes the game seriously, he is "not particularly competitive, and "only play tournaments when I’m out for the WSOP.” Albini expressed an appreciation for the "less macho" attitudes that exist in the game and was opposed to "assholes that try to dominate the table or are King Shit of their local card room. It just galls me and makes me think less of all the people that do it.”

Behrman was known for his warm, witty personality and enjoyed good relations with many other writers, both in and out of the theater world. A newspaper interview he conducted with Siegfried Sassoon, when the British poet was visiting New York after World War I, led to a lifelong friendship and many visits to Sassoon's country house when Behrman was in England. While not gay himself, Behrman was especially supportive of the tribulations of Sassoon's always turbulent love life. Work on dramatizing a short story by Somerset Maugham led to a relaxed, bantering relationship with that British writer as well and many visits to Maugham's home on the Riviera. Publisher Bennett Cerf repeatedly urged Behrman to write a biography of Maugham, feeling that he knew him as well as anyone. It was a project Behrman toyed with throughout the 1960s, but ultimately declined on the advice of "New Yorker" editor William Shawn. When in Italy, he was a welcome guest of Max Beerbohm, whose biography he wrote in 1960, four years after Beerbohm's death.

Overall, despite their technical innovation, Japanese submarines were built in small numbers and had less effect on the war than those of the other major navies. The IJN pursued the doctrine of "guerre d'escadre" (fleet vs fleet warfare), and consequently submarines were often used in offensive roles against warships, which were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships. During the Battle of Midway, "I-168" administered the "coup de grace" to , as well as sinking the destroyer . Later in 1942, Japanese submarine "I-19" sank the fleet carrier , damaged the battleship , and damaged the destroyer (which sank later on 19 October 1942) with a single salvo of torpedoes. However, as fuel oil diminished and air superiority was lost, Imperial submarines were no longer able to continue with such successes. Once the United States was able to increase its production of destroyers and destroyer escorts, as well as bringing over highly effective anti-submarine techniques learned during the Battle of the Atlantic, they continually took more and more of a toll on Imperial Japanese submarines, which also tended to be slower and not as deeply diving as their "Kriegsmarine" counterparts. The Imperial Japanese Navy's doctrine of fleet warfare ("guerre d'escadre") resulted in its submarines seldom posing a threat to allied merchant convoys and shipping lanes to the degree that the Kriegsmarine's U-boats did as they pursued commerce raiding against Allied and neutral merchant ships.
