On 15 May 2006, Small signed for Championship club Sheffield Wednesday for an undisclosed "substantial" transfer fee, signing a three-year contract. On signing Small, then "Wednesday" manager Paul Sturrock said, "I've seen Wade several times over the last couple of years and he's our type of signing. He is very quick, can play in a variety of positions offensively and has high potential. I hope he does very well for Sheffield Wednesday."

"Moby" was released by the New York-based independent label Instinct Records on July 27, 1992. The album was issued without Moby's cooperation, with Moby stating that "all the songs are at least a year old. It's not entirely reflective of where I'm coming from right now." 
Prior to Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo's first appearance was as a playable racer in "Diddy Kong Racing", released for Nintendo 64 in 1997. In "Conker's Bad Fur Day" & "", Banjo's head can be seen, disembodied, above the fireplace in the main menu. Additionally, Kazooie's head can be found on the end of an umbrella in the chapter select screen for both games. In "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", pictures are seen throughout the game as well as scenes from the levels. Also monster versions of Banjo and Kazooie's heads are seen. Following Microsoft's purchase of Rare, Banjo was absent from the Nintendo DS remake, "Diddy Kong Racing DS". Banjo and Kazooie also appear in the Xbox 360 version of "Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing".
