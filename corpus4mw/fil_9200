The ringed anemone is associated with a number of other invertebrates including the opossum shrimp "Heteromysis actiniae" and several species of cleaner shrimps. These include "Ancylomenes pedersoni" and the spotted cleaner shrimp ("Periclimenes yucatanicus") which live close to it or among its tentacles. They invite fish to approach by lashing their white antennae, relying on the anemone to keep them safe from attack. They then nibble at any external parasites that may be attached to the fish.
