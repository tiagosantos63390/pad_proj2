Rush's first major television role came in 2009 when he was cast on "Heroes". He played Zachary Quinto's character Gabriel Gray at a young age. This recurring role was part of a major plot point in season three. After "Heroes", Rush had minor roles on "Parenthood", "", and "Special Agent Oso".

The "Times Higher Education" listed "Requiem for a Species" as "Book of the week" for 3 June 2010. Steven Yearley's review calls it a "provocative and sobering book". He says the heart of the book are the many explanations that Hamilton puts forward for the everyday, regular denial of the danger of changing climate. Yearley says this is also the most frustrating aspect of "Requiem for a Species", because Hamilton proposes so many different explanations but does not make their relative significance clear.
