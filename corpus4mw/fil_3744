Translocator protein (TSPO) is an 18 kDa protein mainly found on the outer mitochondrial membrane. It interacts with StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) to transport cholesterol into mitochondria. It was first described as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a secondary binding site for diazepam, but subsequent research has found the receptor to be expressed throughout the body and brain. In humans, the translocator protein is encoded by the "TSPO" gene. It belongs to family of tryptophan-rich sensory proteins.

Overview.
Literally, "Japanese spirit"; "Yamato damashii" is also written 大和魂. This term is often contrasted with "Chinese Learning" ("karasae"), that is, knowledge and scholarship imported into Japan from China. "Yamato damashii" refers to an inherent faculty of common-sense wisdom, resourcefulness, and prudent judgment that is characteristic of, and unique to, the Japanese people. It also refers to a practical, "real life" ability and intelligence that is in contrast with scholarship and knowledge acquired through formal education. It is a term used to express such ideas as the essential purity and resolute spirit of the Japanese people, the wish for the peace and security of the nation, and the possession of a strong spirit and emotion that will meet any challenge, even at the expense of one's own life. "Yamato damashii" is synonymous with "Yamato gokoro" (lit. "Japanese heart"). 

The STARTTLS SMTP extension is a TLS (SSL) layer on top of the SMTP connection. While it protects traffic from being sniffed during transmission, it is technically not encryption of emails because the content of messages is revealed to, and can therefore be altered by, intermediate email relays. In other words, the encryption takes place between individual SMTP relays, not between the sender and the recipient. When both relays support STARTTLS, it may be used regardless of whether the email's contents are encrypted using another protocol.
