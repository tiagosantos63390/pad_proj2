Joe Winder from "Geeked Out Nation" rated the episode with 8/10 saying that overall was a good episode with a great story that built some of the characters of the show but it completely forgot other main characters, like Irisa's story. "Some of what we learned could be used for future stories. My main issue is the big story was forgotten by everyone and leave me wondering if it’s big deal why did Irisa just forget about it for a few days. I know if it was me I would be freaking out wondering what’s going on."

After expanding their business in 2000, MR-XPM first worked with the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe, Argentina by creating paraboloids specifically for tracking high energy particles. In 2010 Meccanotecnica was selected to contribute to the Large Hadron Collider project in Geneva, Switzerland. Since then, MR-XPM has been involved with projects for the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, among other research institutes.
