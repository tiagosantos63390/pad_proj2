"Bad Guy" was met with universal acclaim from music critics, with the most praise going towards the song's storytelling. Logan Smithson of PopMatters called it a phenomenal track saying, "The opening track, "Bad Guy", is one of the most awe-inspiring pieces of storytelling in hip-hop in quite some time. I’d love to go more in depth, but at the risk of ruining the surprise for those who haven’t yet heard it, I’ll just leave it at that." Julia Leconte of "Now" cited "Bad Guy", as one of the examples for Eminem being, "one of the best all-time storytellers in rap." Erika Ramirez of "Billboard" said, "Eminem introduces "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" by bringing his dark side to light and calling out his transgression through the voice of Stan’s vengeful brother, Matthew Mitchell. One of the best songs on the album for its shifting storytelling, Eminem comes face-to-face with his worst enemy by playing off the narration of "Stan". Andy Baber of Music OMH said, "The song is a lyrical masterpiece, cleverly channeling the criticisms thrown at Eminem over the years through the perspective of Stan’s brother."
