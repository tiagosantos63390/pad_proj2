Recognition and legacy.
The Raymond Alf Museum of Paleontology acts as a unique resource for students of The Webb Schools as they have the opportunity to function as actual paleontologists through hands-on field, lab, and class-based activities. In addition to collecting important fossils on peccary trips, Webb students are involved in all steps of the scientific process including removal from encasing rock and eventual study in the museumâ€™s capstone science course, Honors Advanced Museum Research. With access to a fully equipped and modern research lab, students do original research on the fossils they find in collaboration with museum staff, and publish their results in peer reviewed scientific journals. Webb students also attend regional and international paleontology conferences to present their research and interact with scientists from all over the world.

The first full-length Lord Grey novel, Lord John and the Private Matter, was published by Delacorte Press on September 30, 2003. Though Gabaldon had intended it to be a novella, "Private Matter" came in at 320 pages and secured the author a deal for two additional full Grey novels, "Lord John and the Brotherhood of the Blade" (2007) and "The Scottish Prisoner" (2011). "Private Matter" reached #8 on "The New York Times" Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List. "Publishers Weekly" said of the novel, "Grey is a competent and likable sleuth, and Gabaldon's prose is crisply elegant."
