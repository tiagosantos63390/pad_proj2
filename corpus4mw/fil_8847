RAPid Plates™ RP02 and RP03 are plates that help locate the product in a fixture. They can be used as stop plates, goal posts for round or square product parts, or rough locating guides. A rough locating guide will get the part close to where it needs to be in a fixture so another locating part such as a pin can be used to locate a hole in the product part. A rough locating devise can speed up the production process by guiding the product part into the fixture.
The one remaining limitation of UHF, that of a greatly reduced ability for signals to travel great distances in the presence of obstacles due to terrain, continues to adversely affect digital UHF TV reception. This limitation could potentially be overcome by the use of DTS (Distributed Transmission Systems). Multiple digital UHF transmitters in carefully selected locations can be synchronized as a single-frequency network to produce a tailored coverage area pattern rivaling that of a single full-power VHF transmitter.
