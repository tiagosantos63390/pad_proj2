The 1998 competition was the seventh World Aquatics Championships. However, synchronised swimming is unique at the championships, in that only women compete in the discipline.

North America had their worst showing ever at the World Aquatics Championships, Canada did not win any medals in synchronised swimming for the first time ever. The United States missed the podium in the solo and duet competitions, after winning at least one medal in those disciplines at every previous competition.

The club disbanded in 1878 after just ten seasons. Early that year three Scottish members of the team decided to break away to form their own club for Scots. These men, George Grant, Neil Macglashan and Robert Arnot attracted a number of responses to a circular they sent out. The London Scottish Regiment in particular were very warm to the idea. Very soon after, on 10 April 1878, London Scottish were formed. They had a sizeable fixture list and played some of the leading clubs of the time immediately, such as Ravenscourt Park Football Club and Queen's House Football Club. They also played St Andrew's Rovers that season. St Andrew's, who had lost the core of their best players lost twice to London Scottish and folded at the end of the season.
