Particularly for high-priced, advising-intensive products such as cars or insurance, there are often queries via telephone. The calls happen relatively far along the click chain and, in some cases, they even speed up the purchasing process. Telephone tracking plays an important role in assigning these calls and the profit generated by them to an advertising channel. In addition, the significance of the call can be mapped in the purchasing chain and its position can be determined. If one takes conversion chains, to use an example, that contain a call, it becomes evident that usually this call occurs immediately preceding the profit. At the same time, it can be determined whether the shopping basket content tends to be greater when a customer has called in previously, or if the conversion chain is shorter in cases of caller participation, as the purchasing security of the customer is increased. These and other analyses are possible by means of telephone tracking and lead to a new assessment of the telephone as a channel and thus the marketing measures in this area.

There were, however, periods when the lake dried up. This earned it the local nickname of 'Lake Sometime', because sometimes it was there and sometimes it wasn't!

Filipino historian Ambeth R. Ocampo described that during 19th-century Philippines the sexually attractive female body parts of the time were the "bare arms, a good neck or nape" and "tiny rosy feet".

The sugar business was dominated by American companies such as that Ladd & Co. and Charles Brewer.

After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny added more land mass by accretion that occurred from the south. A few hundred million years later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.
