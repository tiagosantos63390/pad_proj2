The Chou-Fasman method was among the first secondary structure prediction algorithms developed and relies predominantly on probability parameters determined from relative frequencies of each amino acid's appearance in each type of secondary structure. The original Chou-Fasman parameters, determined from the small sample of structures solved in the mid-1970s, produce poor results compared to modern methods, though the parameterization has been updated since it was first published. The Chou-Fasman method is roughly 50-60% accurate in predicting secondary structures.

Phillips bonded with the Valenzuelas and, at one point, actually became Ritchie to them. Such as was the case when an incident involving Ritchie's real-life sister Connie Lemos occurred that disrupted the screening of the film. When at the screening she saw Phillips (as Valens) boarding the plane for the ill-fated Winter Party Dance flight; Lemos, who was only six years old at the time of the crash, was said to hysterically grab onto Phillips and shout, "Don't go Ritchie! Please don't get on the plane! Why did you have to die?" Lemos later admitted on VH-1's "Behind the Music" that she realized at that moment that she never fully accepted her brother's death.

The Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus, "Vultur". Unlike the California condor, which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of congeners, the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, may have been a smaller palaeosubspecies, "V. gryphus patruus".
Mike Eaves is the head coach of the men's hockey team, while Mark Johnson coaches the women's hockey team. Both coaches were teammates on the Badgers' 1977 NCAA title team.
