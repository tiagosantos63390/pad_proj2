A Shiva temple of historical importance is located 6 km from the city. One has to take a diversion at Sorab Road. There is a museum containing old manuscripts written during the Keladi dynasty.

About 400 metres from the summit of the Härmelekopf is the top station of the "Härmelekopfbahn" cable car, from where there is a steep and difficult path to the top which then continues along an arête to the Reither Spitze. Another easier path leads from the top station and then forks, the left branch making for the Reither Scharte and the right branch for the Nördlinger Hut.
On the second floor, there is an intact 18th century billiards room. The kitchen in the wing to the main building has unusually also remained almost completely unchanged since the 18th century.
