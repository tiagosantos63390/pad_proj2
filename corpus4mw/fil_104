Researchers working at Vostok Station produced one of the world's longest ice cores in 1998. A joint Russian, French, and United States team drilled and analyzed the core, which is long. Ice samples from cores drilled close to the top of the lake have been assessed to be as old as 420,000 years. The assumption is that the lake has been sealed from the surface since the ice sheet formed, 15 million years ago. Drilling of the core was deliberately halted roughly above the suspected boundary between the ice sheet and the liquid waters of the lake. This was to prevent contamination of the lake with the 60 ton column of Freon and kerosene Russian scientists filled the borehole with to prevent it from collapsing and freezing over.

She was thus in captivity in Serbia when NATO forces took the capital and Serb troops withdrew from the country.

The endgame tablebases used by the program were restricted to five pieces even though a complete six-piece tablebase was widely available.

The 1986 company-wide crossover "Legends" concluded with the formation of a new Justice League. The new team was dubbed "Justice League" then "Justice League International" (JLI) and was given a mandate with less of an American focus. The new series, written by Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis with art by Kevin Maguire (and later Adam Hughes), added quirky humor to the team's stories. In this incarnation, the membership consisted partly of heroes from Earths that, prior to their merging in the "Crisis on Infinite Earths", were separate. The initial team included Batman, Black Canary, Blue Beetle, Captain Marvel, Doctor Light (a new Japanese female character, emerging from the Crisis of Infinite Earths, not the supervillain who had appeared previously), Doctor Fate, Martian Manhunter, Mister Miracle, and Guy Gardner; and soon after inception, adds Booster Gold, Captain Atom, Fire (then known as the Global Guardians' Green Flame), Ice (then known as the Global Guardians' Icemaiden), and two Rocket Reds (one was a Manhunter spy, and one was Dimitri Pushkin). The Giffen/DeMatteis team worked on "Justice League" for five years and closed out their run with the "Breakdowns" storyline in 1991 and 1992. The series' humorous tone and high level of characterization proved very popular.

In Europe, SS7 links normally are directly connected between switching exchanges using F-links. This direct connection is called "associated signaling". In North America, SS7 links are normally indirectly connected between switching exchanges using an intervening network of STPs. This indirect connection is called "quasi-associated signaling". "Quasi-associated signaling" reduces the number of SS7 links necessary to interconnect all switching exchanges and SCPs in an SS7 signaling network.
