Route description.
The news of Victoria Beckham guest starring on "Ugly Betty" garnered a lot of attention prior to production. There were rumors going around that she would play herself in two episodes and will be paid a large sum of money to do so, which led to a dispute about this story. While Kristin Veitch revealed that this wasn't confirmed in June 2007, another program, "Extra", had a interview with Vanessa Williams, who hints at this one happening. On July 27, 2007, producer Marco Pennette confirmed that Beckham would guest star on the show as a wedding designer, but at the last minute settled on having Vera Wang play the designer instead.

Starting in the 1930s, non-Muslim residents of Cihangir and the rest of Beyoğlu left or were forced out. They were replaced by Muslims from other Istanbul neighborhoods and by internal migrants from eastern Turkey. As the character of the neighborhood changed, middle-class Muslims also began leaving the neighborhood. By the 1970s, Cihangir was known as a neighborhood where Anatolian migrants lived alongside artists and intellectuals.

As the only legitimate town in the Upper Moselle Valley, Nittel is the home of the town's own newspaper, the “Darfscheel”, whose title is Moselle Franconian for “Village Bell”. The “Darfscheel” is a community newspaper for Nittel, the districts of Köllig and Rehlingen as well as the Luxembourger Machtum on the opposite side of the Moselle River. It is published three or four times a year with the circulation of about 1,500 copies. The newspaper is politically and economically independent. It is distributed free to all the households in Nittel, Köllig, Rehlingen and Machtum. All the employees and the authors are volunteers. On 29 October 2010 the “Darfscheel” was incorporated as a charitable organization with the name of “"Darfscheel - Dorfzeitung Nittel eV"” - Town Newspaper of Nittel, Inc..
After the death of Edward I Droxford ceased to hold office in the wardrobe, and in the first year of King Edward II sat in the exchequer as chancellor. On 25 December 1308 the king, in sending his congé d'élire to the cathedral chapters of Bath and Wells, nominated him for election; he received the temporalities of the see on 15 May 1309, and was enthroned at Wells about twelve months afterwards. During the first four years of his episcopate he was seldom in his diocese; "political troubles" he writes, in December 1312, "having hindered our residence". In later years, though often in London and elsewhere, and paying an annual visit to his private estates, he was also much in Somerset. He did not make either Bath or Wells his headquarters, but moved about constantly, attended apparently by a large retinue, from one to another of the manor-houses, sixteen or more in number, attached to the see and used as episcopal residences. Magnificent and liberal, he was, like many of his fellow-bishops, a worldly man, and by no means blameless in the administration of his patronage, for he conferred a prebend on a member of the house of Berkeley who was a layman and a mere boy, and in the bountiful provision he made for his relations out of the revenues of his church he was not always careful to act legally. He had some disputes with his chapter which were settled in 1321.

Located in the Drainage basin of the Adour, the Gave d'Ossau forms the eastern border as it curves around the town and continues west, forming the northern border of the commune, to join the Gave d'Aspe to form the Gave d'Oloron at Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Many tributaries rise in the south of the commune and flow north to join the Gave d'Ossau including the Lamisou, the Arrec de Baycabe, the Ruisseau du Bois de Nougué, the Arrec de Lacerbelle, and the Ruisseau du Termy which forms the western border of the commune.
In 2010 the commune had 148 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.
