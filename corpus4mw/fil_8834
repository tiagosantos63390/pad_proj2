In 1833, Louis-Philippe proposed the establishment of a museum dedicated to “all the glories of France,” which included the Orléans dynasty and the Revolution of 1830 that put Louis-Philippe on the throne of France. For the next decade, under the direction of Eugène-Charles-Frédéric Nepveu and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, the château underwent irreversible alterations (Constans, 1985; 1987; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet, 1985). The museum was officially inaugurated on 10 June 1837 as part of the festivities that surrounded the marriage of the Prince royal, Ferdinand-Philippe d’Orléans with princess Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and represented one of the most ambitious and costly undertakings of Louis-Philippe’s reign.

SSPL developed other operations relating to Paradise Island that were rejected by policymakers. These included training visitors to assassinate North Vietnamese officials, and encouraging them to develop guerilla warfare plans upon returning to North Vietnam.

Yoren (Francis Magee) tells Arya (Maisie Williams) the story of how he became a member of the Night's Watch. Soon, they are startled by a nearby war horn. Lannister bannerman Ser Amory Lorch (Fintan McKeown) demands Yoren hand over Gendry (Joe Dempsie). When Yoren refuses, a battle ensues, and Yoren and his men are killed. During the skirmish, Arya gives the prisoner Jaqen (Tom Wlaschiha) an axe to free himself and the other two captives before they can be burned alive in their cage. Lorch orders the survivors taken to Harrenhal, but when wounded Lommy Greenhands (Eros Vlahos) says he cannot walk, he is killed. Lorch demands the survivors point out Gendry, but before he can give himself up, Arya fools Lorch by telling him that Lommy was Gendry.

SK Jugoslavija was completely disbanded with most of its property and players, including the field, handed over to the newly formed Red Star Belgrade, while BSK, although initially also disbanded, it ended being restored as OFK Beograd, a medium-small size club with obviously lower ambitions than BSK, and even so their right to assume and claim the continuity was only accepted after the socialist regime ended.

Native American communities, particularly reservations in the United States and Canada, have had a reputation for high crime rates. Restorative justice is an important alternative to the Prison Industrial Complex in these communities. Native Americans are largely overrepresented in Western penal systems, and are moving towards self-determination in administering restorative justice to their communities. Some alternatives that have been suggested are community-based programs, participation in Western sentencing circles, and re-institution of traditional corporal punishment. A successful example of this is the Miyo Wahkotowin Community Education Authority, which uses restorative techniques at the three Emineskin Cree nation schools it operates in Alberta, Canada. The Authority has a special Sohki program which has a coordinator work with students with “behavioral issues” rather than punish them and has had successful results.
