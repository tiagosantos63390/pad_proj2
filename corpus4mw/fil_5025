December 1944 found "Casa Grande" preparing for the second of the massive operations in the Philippines, and on 31 December she sailed in Attack Group "Baker" of Task Force 79 (TF 79) for Lingayen Gulf. First enemy contact came at sunset on 8 January 1945, as a small but determined group of kamikazes attacked. One of these broke through to damage "Kitkun Bay" (CVE-71) severely, but "Casa Grande" came through unscathed, and joined in driving away the scattered individual enemy aircraft which pushed the attack onward.
Zalloua and Wells (2004), under the auspices of a grant from National Geographic Magazine examined the origins of the Canaanite Phoenicians.
Systems in the special strict-feedback form have a recursive structure similar to the many-integrator system structure. Likewise, they are stabilized by stabilizing the smallest cascaded system and then "backstepping" to the next cascaded system and repeating the procedure. So it is critical to develop a single-step procedure; that procedure can be recursively applied to cover the many-step case. Fortunately, due to the requirements on the functions in the strict-feedback form, each single-step system can be rendered by feedback to a single-integrator system, and that single-integrator system can be stabilized using methods discussed above.
