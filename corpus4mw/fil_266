The Reform Party had major differences with other major federal political parties in regards to national unity, as the party did not treat the Francophone province of Quebec in a unique manner but instead saw Quebec as one of all the provinces of Canada and that all provinces should be treated equally and that no province should have a special status. The Reform Party unlike other major federal parties did not believe that Quebec secession should be sought to be avoided at all costs and by all means because the party believed that this amounted to favouritism to Quebec. Reformers believed that Canada could continue to exist without Quebec, but hoped that offers of decentralization of federal powers to all the provinces would satisfy the desire by the government of Quebec for greater autonomy while being equitable to all the provinces.

The primary species, "Viridomys orbatus", is known from fossils found in Campanian (Upper Cretaceous)-aged strata of the Upper Milk River Formation in Alberta, Canada. Possible remains have also been found in Dogie Mountain, Texas (USA). The Texas site is believed to be Paleocene in age.

Plans for an Aylesbury bypass exist and are well supported locally but no government decision has been made.
The same effluvial deposition of bentonite clay onto beaches accounts for the variety of plasticity of sand from place to place for building sand castles. Beach sand consisting of only silica and shell grains does not mold well compared to grains coated with bentonite clay. This is why some beaches are much better for building sand castles than others.
Throughout this time, although the Catholic birth rate remained higher than for Protestants, the Catholic proportion of the population declined, as poor economic prospects, especially west of the River Bann saw Catholics emigrate in disproportionate numbers.

In 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British archaeology and Egyptology. The focus of Petrie’s work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926 (although he did become interested in early Egypt, in 1928 digging a cemetery at Luxor that proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today). He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including Tell el-Jemmeh and Tell el-Ajjul.
Green Bay has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification "Dfb"), with some moderation due to the city's proximity to Lake Michigan. Like other cities with this type of climate, there are four distinct seasons, often with severe or extreme variation between them in terms of temperature and precipitation. Green Bay experiences warm, humid, frequently hot summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme. Tornadoes are rare in the Green Bay area, with the strongest being an F3 tornado that hit the community of Pittsfield on June 26, 1969.
After Kirnberger died in 1783, C.P.E. Bach became Breitkopfs's editor for these chorales, which he then published in four parts: 1784: nos. 1–96, 1785: nos. 97–194, 1786: 195–283, 1787: 283–370 (the number 283 was mistakenly used for two different chorales which became 283a and 283b; this numbering error was corrected from the 1831 dritte Auflage on). This publication went through four more editions and countless reprintings until 1897 (see above). Additionally, several other editions using the original C-clef or different texts were also published. The Bach Gesellschaft published the original 371 chorales from the C.P.E. Bach edition in volume 39 of their "Complete Works" in 1892. The most significant recent publication is Dr. Charles Sanford Terry's "J.S. Bach's Four-Part Chorales", Oxford University Press 1929 (reprinted 1964, with a foreword by Walter Emery), which contains 405 harmonised chorales and 95 melodies with figured bass. The most widely known collection is Albert Riemenschneider's "371" (1941).
The southern of the two principal islands, Fukue, measures approximately 25 km north-to-south by 25 km east-to-west; the northern, Nakadori Island, measures approximately 40 km north-to-south by 20 km east-to-west at its widest point. Most of Nakadori Island, however, is quite narrow, measuring less than 6 km wide for much of its length. Some dome-shaped hills command the old castletown of Fukue. The islands are highly cultivated; deer and other game abound, and trout are plentiful in the mountain streams.

The ninth season features a new title sequence with a new version of the theme song "Superman" performed by WAZ. The new title sequences features the four new characters–Denise, Lucy, Drew and Cole, as well as Dr. Cox and Turk, while J.D. is seen at the end placing the chest X-ray. In all season 9 episodes that do not feature J.D., he is absent from the title sequence and Lucy is the one placing the X-ray. The X-ray at the end of the sequence is also not backwards and the subtitle "Med School" appears at the end of the sequence.
There are usually two to four eggs in a clutch, all with a white base color that is consistently covered in brown and pale purple spots. The eggs hatch after an unusually short incubation period of only 10 to 11 days. Both sexes share a responsibility in the incubation of the eggs; the female sits on the nest for most of the daylight hours and throughout the night, while male incubates them during the middle part of the day. Unlike their close relatives, the African and masked finfoot, the sungrebe chicks are hatched with only sparse down and poorly-matured feet and bill. The chicks hatch naked, blind, and defenseless.[http://montereybay.com/creagrus/sungrebes.html]
In the late Republic, two three-man political alliances are called triumvirates by modern scholars, though only for the second was the term "triumviri" used at the time to evoke constitutional precedents:
