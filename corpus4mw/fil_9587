Among his first books was "The Big Way" (1956) as well as other novels like "The Currents of the Big River" (1965), "Dance of Capricorn" and "The Yurt of the Horse Herder". He won several Russian and Tuvan prizes. His whole life he collected stories from his kinsmen, storytellers, shamans, workers, herders and poets. For his research on shamanism he was persecuted during Sovjet times; his grandmother shamaness Kuular Khandyshap died after being imprisoned in a Gulag for 15 years.
In 1959, Woodhall House was bought for Â£8000 by the Society of Jesus. It originally served as a retreat house for weekend retreats in Ignatian spirituality for working men's sodalities and parish groups as well as being the novitiate for the proposed Scottish Province of Jesuits. They intended to create a Scottish Province of Jesuits that would extend their pre-existing works in Scotland and would also build a link between Scottish Jesuits and Jesuits working abroad such as in, what was then known as, British Guyana.
