"Strive" joined the invasion force en route to Palermo, Sicily, and arrived off the landing beaches on 9 July. She swept mines and patrolled off the beachhead until the 15th, and returned to Palermo on 1 August. The minesweeper then escorted a convoy to Bizerte to join Task Force (TF) 81, the Salerno invasion force. She sailed early in September for Italy. The minesweeper preceded the fleet toward the beaches, clearing paths for the transports and landing craft. As the Allied 5th Army landed on 9 September, "Strive" guided landing craft through swept channels to the beaches and led cruisers to positions to support the landing forces. The ships were under enemy air attack from the 9th to the 11th, but "Strive" was not damaged. When her mission had been accomplished, she escorted convoys between North African ports and Naples until late December 1943. She was attached to Mine Squadron 6 in early December and remained in that squadron while operating in the European theater.

The Montgomery Street School, located at 2500-2506 Montgomery Street, Louisville, Kentucky, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1852, and once used as a Civil War hospital, it has been a school since 1869. It has since been expanded and renovated. It was formerly the Emma Dolfinger School, a public elementary school. Until 2008, the building was used by Portland Christian School as an elementary school, but Portland Christian has since consolidated the elementary school into its Portland Ave. campus one block to the south.
The North (entrance front) faces the main A413 road from Aylesbury to Buckingham and is within a few metres and clearly visible from the road, something very rare in an English country house, one other instance where this happens is Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire. Hence Winslow Hall is almost unique as both a town and a country house. Thus it is even more remarkable that it has survived largely unaltered, escaped conversion to institutional or office use, and remains today (2014) an inhabited house.
