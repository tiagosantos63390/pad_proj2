In 1875 the Khedive of Egypt had gone bankrupt and needed to sell shares in the Suez Canal (of whose traffic four-fifths was British) in order to gain money. Disraeli purchased 176,602 shares in the Canal in order to stop the imperial lifeline to India and Australia falling into French hands. Disraeli persuaded Lionel de Rothschild to lend the British government the £4m needed to purchase the shares. Because the Khedive had mortgaged the shares until 1894 the British government only received the mortgage payments of approximately £200,000 a year. However in 1895 the British government received a dividend of £690,000; in 1901 it was £880,000. The market value of the shares also rose: in 1898 they had risen from £4m to £24m and were rising at around £2m a year. By 1914 they were worth over £40m.
