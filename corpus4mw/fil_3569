Just for fun, Victoria gets one of the nice dresses from the front window, which Lily loves; she cannot afford it, but accidentally sits down in the free cake provided by the bridal shop, and then rips the dress. Later at the bar, Marshall gets the bill for the suit from Barney and finds out that he must pay $4,000 for it, even though Barney promised him a great deal, and realizes it must be a ruse by Barney to get him to accept a high-paying job at Barney's firm, something which Barney attempts to deny. He turns to Lily and says he'll do whatever it takes to pay it off, at which point Lily breaks down and reveals that she ruined, and thus had to purchase, an $8,000 dress; Marshall, his back to the wall and with no other option to pay $12,000 plus the money for the wedding, decides to go work for Barney.
