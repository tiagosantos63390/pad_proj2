Claude Bell's giant dinosaur sculptures are icons of roadside America: while many have grown up with them along the highway in southern California, others may also remember them from various films and videos, perhaps most famously "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." The site features two sculptures: a 150-ton building in the shape of a larger-than-life-sized "Apatosaurus" (begun in 1964, completed in 1975), and a 100-ton "Tyrannosaurus rex" structure (built in 1981). The dinosaurs, nicknamed "Dinny" and "Mr. Rex" respectively, were originally built to attract customers to Claude Bell's Wheel Inn Cafe.
