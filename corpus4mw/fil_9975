With his pharmacist brother Mike, Bozeman for a time operated the old Winnfield Drug Company. Bozeman returned temporarily to the life of a traveling salesman. In Tyler, Texas, he met and soon married in 1922 Annabell Estes (1894-1956). Back in Winnfield, he was sales manager for the Southern Minerals Company until the company quarry was sold in 1923. Harley and Annabell Bozeman had two children, Helen Gayle Bozeman Fausett (1923-2007) of Oklahoma City and Estes Bernard Bozeman (1926-2007) of Winnfield. Estes Bozeman, like his father a tree farmer and weather observer, died some three months prior to his sister's passing.

In 942, Shi Jingtang died, and Shi Chonggui succeeded him as emperor. He made Li "Zhifang Langzhong" (職方郎中), a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service (吏部, "Libu"). Shortly after, Li was made "Libu Langzhong" (吏部郎中) — also a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service, as well as secretary at the treasury (度支判官, "Duzhi"). At some point, for reasons lost to history, Li was removed from his offices. In 944, when Shi Chonggui personally led a campaign against Later Jin's northern neighbor Khitan Empire, he issued an edict asking Li to accompany him on the campaign, and he made Li an imperial scholar at the office of the chief of staff (樞密直學士, "Shumi Zhi Xueshi"), as well as imperial attendant (給事中, "Geishizhong"). However, Li was disliked by Shi Chonggui's close associates Feng Yu and Li Yantao (李彥韜). When Shi Chonggui later led another campaign against Khitan, Li Gu was made the deputy director of the three financial ministries (i.e., treasury, taxation, and salt and iron monopolies).
Upon his most heinous attempt to take control, Levistus tried to subsume Bensozia, Asmodeus's consort whom he thought knew very well her master's weaknesses. At that time, Bensozia was leading a routine inspection of the layers with her pit-fiend escort and Asmodeus's constable, Martinet. While they were travelling across Stygia, Levistus ambushed them and proposed that the Queen of Hell become his consort if she helped him depose Asmodeus. The staunch queen refused harshly and passed him by. Infuriated, the Lord of the Fifth killed Bensozia and her pit-fiend bodyguards while Martinet managed to escape.
