Sobottka wrote of his hopelessness in 1940, after he'd been in prison for 26 months. Though he still had faith in the KPD, he said he'd lost hope that the truth would prevail and he'd escape his situation. He added that if his faith in the party were shattered, the result would be his mental and physical collapse. Just a few months later, on September 22, 1940, Sobottka died in Butyrka prison, according to some sources, from injuries sustained during torture; others say he was shot. His parents weren't told about their son's death until the beginning of 1941.

Comparing the book to "Conan the Outcast", another of Carpenter's Conan novels, reviewer Lagomorph Rex rates it "not nearly as bad," noting that it "had a plot, though pretty far fetched even for the Conan pastiches ... to stretch the credibility of what the Barbarian would put up with." He also takes issue with its chronological placement in the schemes of Robert Jordan (before "Conan the Champion") and William Galen Gray (before "Rogues in the House"), concurring with them that it would take place after "The God in the Bowl," but advancing "Conan the Hunter" as a more natural sequel.

Muslims, also in Diyarbekir, thought that an Armenian Kingdom was about to be created under protection of European Powers and the end of Islamic rule was imminent.

It was rumoured that Kurdish tribal leaders outside the town had promised to send 10,000 Kurdish fighters to avenge themselves.
