Devilwood is a 2006 British short film. It was written and directed by Sacha Bennett, and stars John Simm.
It is a very simple trap, made from four main components: a bamboo pipe, a piece of wood, a nail and a small arms cartridge. The device required a cartridge to be stood upright and when a person (usually a soldier) stepped on the trap, the pressure placed on the bullet would force it down onto a nail, igniting the primer and subsequently causing the round to fire.

1965 Gill was guest artist to teach painting at the University of Idaho. His works of art appeared oppressive and dark in shade of color and mood in these years. Main topic was social and political events on the day like the Vietnam War. A serial of anti-war paintings featured civilians and military leaders. The playwright William Inge described the men in these paintings as “figures of high public reputation, momentarily caught in some nefarious act that will probably destroy their political or professional reputations.” "

The idea of organizing the SBUR was initiated in early 1985 by Dr. Timothy L. Ratliff, then a young urologic researcher, who discussed the idea with Dr. Warren “Skip” Heston and Dr. William Catalona, receiving enthusiastic support from the two senior scientists. The SBUR-organizing meeting was held in 1986 at the AUA Annual Meeting in New York with a group of about 15 scientists attending to finalize the idea of a new society by the name of The Society for Basic Urologic Research. Drs. Evelyn Barrack, Ralph Buttyan, Donald Coffey, Warren Heston, Dolores Lamb, Chung Lee, David Lubaroff, Timothy Ratliff, Gregor Reid, and Roy Smith were among the attendees. At the meeting Dr. Ratliff, the Founding President of the SBUR, assumed the responsibility of organizing the first scientific meeting in 1987 and drafting the first bylaws, which were required for establishment of a non-profit status. Dr. Chung Lee worked diligently with Dr. Ratliff and was instrumental in modifying the bylaws to conform to the legal requirements for SBUR as a non-profit society in Illinois, to begin raising funds for the scientific meeting. Dr. Paul Peters, then Secretary of the AUA, provided space for the first SBUR scientific meeting free of charge at the 1987 AUA Annual Meeting (May 17–21, 1987, Anaheim, California). Leaders of urology programs throughout the country were uniformly supportive of organizing SBUR and many provided travel expenses for urologic scientists to attend the first meeting, thanks to the tireless efforts by Dr. Ratliff. The first SBUR scientific meeting was small with around 50-60 attendees, but everyone considered the meeting a success. Enthusiasm for SBUR increased as a result, making the organization of the subsequent meetings much easier.

Announcing the May 2004 proposal, Howard said:
The bridge was restored in 1970 and 2004 and is still in use, with average daily traffic of 224 vehicles in 2009. Despite the restorations, as of 2009 the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the National Bridge Inventory was only 17.7 percent and its condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action". It is one of three remaining covered bridges in Sullivan County, and according to Susan M. Zacher's "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide", its location "over the rocky Loyalsock Creek" is "one of the most attractive settings in the state."

Vibro gained superhuman powers due to his nuclear-powered seismic energy-absorbing apparatus being grafted to his body; this apparatus has been transformed into a vibrational energy generator. Vibro has the ability to generate high-level seismic vibrations and fire them from his hands as vibratory or concussive force, causing shockwaves, opening chasms, and/or generating earthquakes. He also has the ability to harness the thrust of his vibratory force emissions for flight at subsonic speeds, and he has the ability to generate shields of vibratory force around himself. Vibro has immunity to the effects of his own powers.
