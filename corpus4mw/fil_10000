The ROM dates the print to c. 1799, which is in line with the data offered by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Museum Angewandte Kunst in Frankfurt. Both the Honolulu Museum of Art and the British Museum date the print slightly earlier at 1797-1798. The Art Institute of Chicago narrows the date to 1798.

At judging, the models are evaluated on their walks as well as a photo that was snapped of them while they walked. Cheandre, Michelle and Michaela impress the judges with their walks. Rhulani is praised due to her ability to learn how to walk despite being a rookie. Safira and Roselyn disappoint the judges with their lackluster photos and walks. They are also critiqued due to their lack of versatility. Cheandre is deemed the best performer of the week, while Safira and Roselyn are placed in the bottom two. Oluchi reveals that the judges saw more versatility in Roselyn, and in a very emotional elimination, Safira is sent home.
