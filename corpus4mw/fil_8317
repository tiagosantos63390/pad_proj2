IVAO relies solely on software developed by its own staff of volunteers. Air Traffic Controllers can connect to the IVAO network using IVAO's radar client, IvAc, that emulates the interface of a modern, real-world air traffic control radar scope. Pilots can connect using their flight simulator and the built-in pilot client, IvAp. All pilots and ATC thereby interact on a dedicated, one-world server environment that tries to simulate world-wide air traffic on an "as real as it gets" basis.

A small building, marked as a ruin in 1856 and now entirely absent, with its own entrance and sheep fauld, sat within woodland in line with the small loch and later substantial drainage ditch feature that runs down to the main loch. The larger Lochlands Farm (NS378555) buildings lay closer to the road a little further back from the Lowes Loch. It has been abandoned since before the 1950s, shown as active in 1914 from the record of the OS map. A photograph of the early 1900s shows a substantial and unusual design for a farm building; 'L' shaped and 'Council House' like in appearance. The OS map shows that this later building had an orchard or ornamental garden and was more of a dwelling than a farm, being occupied by a family who owned the Cunningham bus company in Paisley which became part of Western SMT. It was demolished as part of precautions intended to prevent any possible contamination of the reservoir water.
