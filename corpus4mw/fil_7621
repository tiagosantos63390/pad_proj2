Structure.
Bronx Central Annex-U.S. Post Office is a historic post office building located at the Bronx, New York, United States. It was built from 1935 to 1937, and designed by consulting architect Thomas Harlan Ellett (1880-1951) for the Office of the Supervising Architect. Constructed of smooth gray brick and is surrounded by a granite terrace, the building features graceful window openings set within marble arches. On the terrace are two sculptures dating to 1936: "The Letter" by Henry Kreis and "Noah" by Charles Rudy. The interior features 13 mural panels inspired by Walt Whitman's poem "I See America Working". They were executed by Ben Shahn (1898-1969) and his wife Bernarda Bryson Shahn (1903-2004) and were completed in August 1939.
