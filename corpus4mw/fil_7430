Ulrik then dispossessed his aunt, Catherine Hahn-Hinrichshagen, the widow of his uncle Ulrich II. He had endowed her with the manor and estates of Zibühl (a part of today's Dreetz in Mecklenburg) as her allodial dower, which he had bought for 17,000 rixdollars in 1621. After a rebuild and furnishing, including the fixture of her and his coat-of-arms on the outside, Hahn had moved in. Lacking the power she acquiesced on the dispossession for the time being. However, on 16 December 1628, after Wallenstein had conquered the prince-bishopric, Hahn sued Ulrik in the "Ducal Court and Land Tribunal of Mecklenburg". Due to the changing fortunes of the Thirty Years' War the tribunal never rendered a verdict.

After the war, the bridge was reconstructed by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads and then Philippine Bureau of Public Works under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1945. Carrying the name of the bridge, the new span was a simple bridge with metal pole railings, bare in design. The war also lost one of the four La Madre Filipina statues; the surviving monuments were moved to other locations in Manila. Two of them now stand near the steps of the Court of Appeals Building while one was moved to Rizal Park.

Arthur Frederick Dobbs (31 March 1876 – 16 February 1955) was a Unionist politician in Northern Ireland.
An announcement was made on September 9, 1905 that Norman E. Mack, owner of the "Buffalo Times", would purchase the "Syracuse Telegram". His plans included adding a "Democratic" morning edition and there was discussion about continuing the evening edition. Mack was a rich businessman and had made all his money in the newspaper industry. It is not known what happened to this proposal.

He represented the Hampden electorate from 1862 to 1863, when he resigned.
According to Kaplan the Sabbatical cycles in "Sefer HaTemunah" can be used as a basis for calculating the age of the universe. While "Sefer HaTemunah" sees the world as existing in the second cycle, others say it is in the seventh cycle. If so, Adam was created when the universe was 42,000 years old, and six worlds were created and destroyed before the creation of Adam. This thesis was laid out by Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, a 13th-century Kabbalist, who said that when calculating the age of the universe, one must use divine years rather than physical years.
