Lawley was the son of Francis Lawley of Spoonhill near Much Wenlock, Shropshire and his wife Elizabeth Newport, daughter of Sir Richard Newport. Lawley succeeded to estate at Spoonhill on the death of his brother in 1623. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Drapers. In 1625, he was elected Member of Parliament for Wenlock. He was re-elected MP for Wenlock in 1626 and in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. 
1997–98 and 1998–99 finished pretty much the same for Mansfield. In 1997–98, the club was again just above the relegation zone until a good run of form left them 12th, five points off the play-offs. 1998–99 was the opposite. 40 points were gained from the first half of the season, whereas only 27 points were gained from the second half, leaving Mansfield with a slightly disappointing finish of 8th. Mansfield were actually still in the play-offs with three games left, but lost the next two games, extinguishing all hopes of the play-offs for another season.
