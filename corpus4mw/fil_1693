It opened on 1 October 1908 (by A.Grenander), then the terminus of Berlin's second U-Bahn line, connecting it with Potsdamer Platz on the initial "Stammstrecke" route. It is named after "Spittelmarkt" square, former site of the Saint Gertrude hospital established about 1400. The station designed by Alfred Grenander was lavishly erected right beneath the banks of the Spree river, with daylight windows above the water surface.
There had not been a station on the A II/B II (now U3) at the interchange point, so the Nürnberger Platz station, located only one or two hundred metres to the north, was replaced with a new station. To facilitate transfers to the new G (now U9), the U3 section of the Spichernstraße station was built with side platforms rather than a centre platform as at the old station. Construction was relatively simple since there was a turning area for the Nürnberger Platz station at the location; trains were routed over the ancillary tracks and the new platforms constructed on the site of the former main tracks.

Baroni was an associate at DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick & Cole, and then at Blank Rome. He was of counsel at Fornaro Francioso, a Hamilton firm. He served as chief counsel to Congressman Bob Franks in his 2000 U.S. Senate race. In 2002, when U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli withdrew his candidacy for re-election five weeks before Election Day after the Senate admonished him on ethics charges, Baroni argued for the Republicans in the New Jersey Supreme Court against a last-minute switch of candidates to Frank Lautenberg.
Initially, he studied the thirteenth century, with perceptive 'Studies' in the period of baronial reform, but, disliking the powerful hold of Sir Maurice Powicke, he switched to the unresearched 1350-1500 period. His most important works were a four-volume edition of the register of Archbishop Henry Chichele of Canterbury, 1414-1443, founder of All Souls College, Oxford and a volume in the magisterial Oxford History of England series, England in the Fifteenth Century. The first of these publications secured his reputation as a historian (although in fact his co-editor had actually transcribed the manuscript), but the latter caused considerable controversy. Firstly the book was meant to be written by K. B. McFarlane, who proved unwilling or unable to write a book of its kind. Secondly, after the book was released many academics suggested that Jacob's had plagiarized postgraduates' work and had also made a large number of factual errors. The book also lacked shape or much interpretation of the fifteenth-century political scene, out-of-date the minute it was published. It is true that at Manchester he had his postgraduate students (including Sir Maurice Oldfield, the future security chief), working on aspects of his own projects and incorporated their findings into his own, albeit usually with a general acknowledgment. He was charged with having extended this, for his general book, to drawing on the work of other scholars' students, and without acknowledgment. In response, he declared his gratitude to the many workers in the field but asserted that the conventions of the Oxford History did not allow for specific footnotes. Perhaps significantly, his actual biography of Archbishop Chichele was a slight work from a non-academic publishing house, and he generally favored a lecture/essay approach, as he had done even in his earliest years. His knowledge of German especially allowed him to write vignettes on the Catholic Church in the period of the Great Schism and Conciliar Movement perceptively, although again there was to be no great magnum opus, and again it was muttered that his knowledge of continental scholarship was better than his knowledge of primary sources. Even J.S. Roskell, a devoted disciple, recorded decades later that he found one lecture/subsequently-published essay painfully familiar from just the basic English monograph he himself had used for an undergraduate essay. Nonetheless, Jacob's transmission of continental scholarship to an insular English academia was invaluable and influential.
The BTR-50 was developed in 1952 and entered service with the Soviet Army in 1954. It was first shown in public in November 1957. It served in the motorized rifle regiments of tank divisions and mechanized brigades in the Soviet and East German armies. A typical mechanized brigade consisted of three battalions which each had thirty APCs and one command vehicle. They were replaced in front line service by the BMP-1 IFV. Command vehicle variants were employed by many Warsaw Pact armies.
The Nine Lyric or Melic Poets were a canonical group of ancient Greek poets esteemed by the scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria as worthy of critical study. 
The economic model has been reworked. In previous games, goods could only be picked up at a station, and revenue depended on the distance between stations. Carloads in "Railroad Tycoon 3" slowly move across the map (representing road and water transport) along the gradient of a scalar field representing price, where supply and demand sites function as sources and sinks. Revenue depends on the price difference between pick-up and delivery. This has several effects; raw materials can find their way to industries and get processed, without any trains involved, and a train does not need to pick up goods at the source.

Description.
By the end of the 18th century, crossbreeding of Finnish horses began to be described, especially by military leaders, as "detrimental crossbreeding"—damaging to the quality of the Finnish horse, particularly for military use. In the beginning of the 19th century, German historian Friedrich Rühs especially blamed the west coast estates for damaging the Finnish horse by crossbreeding. Nonetheless, outside stallions were still imported to Finland. At the end of the century, stallions "of oriental, Arabian blood" still served at state farms. The influence of the Russian-imported "oriental" Turkish and Caucasian horses, as well as "Fürstenbergian" horses was also noted. Orlov Trotters were used in Savonia and Karelia, and Norwegian stallions were brought to northern Ostrobothnia. Light riding horses were imported from Russian and Central Europe. Conversely, heavier horses such as the Norfolk Trotter and Ardennes were imported to southern Finland as late as 1870.

During Leigh's time in the Senate the controversy over slavery reached new levels of intensity. The House of Representatives passed a "gag rule" tabling all anti-slavery petititions, and a similar measure died in the Senate, though that body approved an alternate method of ignoring such petitions. President Jackson called on the Congress to censor anti-slavery publications from the federal mails, a bill the Senate defeated 25-19. Leigh proposed a statewide boycott of pro-emancipation newspapers, writing that Virginians had the right "to suppress to the utmost of our power what we deem inflammatory, dangerous, mischievous."
