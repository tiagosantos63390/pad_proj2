It’s credit to Henry for challenging himself on so many levels, and the rewards could well be all the richer for it, but as he approaches this big step in his career, as he says himself, “the only thing I was focussed on during the composition of the album was to create the most honest album I could. By mixing all my influences, I just let my mind flow in the studio and these are the results – I strived to create something original and special. At the end of the day it’s all about the feelings you get when listening to music, the places it can take you, the thoughts, memories and emotions that can shake your brain… I hope others can feel that too.”

The second single was "Doghouse", written by Eric Stefani. It is about a man who is bullied and dominated by his girlfriend and is unwilling to force the situation to change. The song uses the metaphor of a dog and its master to illustrate the nature of the relationship, saying that she had got him "by the reins" and he has been "conditioned" by her. The single's B-side was "You Can't Teach an Ol' Dog New Tricks", written by Eric Stefani.
