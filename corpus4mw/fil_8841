Mauritius was scheduled to compete in several competitions, which they ended up withdrawing from before playing a single match. The list includes the 2002 Confederation of Southern African Football Associations women's tournament in Harare, Zimbabwe from which they withdrew. In 2005, Zambia was supposed to host a regional Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA) women's football tournament, with several countries agreeing to send teams including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland. The tournament eventually took place in 2006, but Mauritius did not send a team. Beyond that, they were scheduled to participate in the 2008 Women's U-20 World Cup qualification, where they were scheduled to play Zimbabwe in the preliminary round; however, Zimbabwe withdrew from the competition giving Mauritius an automatic bye into the first round. In that round Mauritius was supposed to play South Africa, but withdrew from the competition.
