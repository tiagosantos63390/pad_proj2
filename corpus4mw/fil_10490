The Dorchester South Burying Ground is a historic graveyard on Dorchester Avenue in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Established in 1814, it is the second oldest cemetery in Dorchester, after the North Burying Ground. It is a roughly parcel on the west side of Dorchester Avenue, north of Dorchester Lower Mills. A paved roadway provides circulation around the perimeter of the property. There is some evidence that the cemetery was formally terraced, due to the sloping terrain, but there is no evidence of curbing that might have been used for this purpose. One of the cemetery's most prominent features is a line of granite tombs along the southern boundary.
