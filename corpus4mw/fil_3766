Judy Neuffer was born in Wooster, Ohio. Influenced in part by her father, a WWII B-17 pilot and post-war airport manager, Neuffer started accompanying her father to work during summer breaks from school at age 11. Her summer assignments were usually those of helping in the airport front office, but it turned out to be close enough to excite her young passion for things that fly. By the time Neuffer was 15 she had already started flight lessons in the legendary Piper Cub airplane. At 16 years of age, she successfully soloed in the Cub. At eighteen, Neuffer started attending Ohio State University, graduating four years later with a B.S. Degree in Computer Science. It was in her junior year of college that Judy first became intrigued with the idea of serving in the military. She enlisted at the end of her junior year and was commissioned when she graduated the following year. She was serving her first tour of duty in the Navy when flight training opened up to women.
