The New Zealand government decided in 1987 to restore "Akarana" and give her to Australia as the county's gift to celebrate the Australian Bicentennial in 1988. The government purchased her from her existing owner, Andrew Bishop. Instead of the planned start date of 14 May 1987, delays meant she did not arrive back to New Zealand until 24 July 1987.
