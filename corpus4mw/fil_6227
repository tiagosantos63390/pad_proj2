Traditional mariachi is a string ensemble from western México. Unlike the popular mariachi, this ensemble generally does not include trumpets. It consists of violins, guitarra de golpe, vihuelas, harp and guitarrón or double bass, and in some zones a bass drum is used. This mariachi developed from the beginning of 19th century and from this ensemble derived the mariachi with trumpets. Its repertoire generally covered "sones abajeños", "sones arribeños", "sones costeños" and "jarabes", and a wood box for dancing was widely used. Some groups have been caught performing popular music as well. This ensemble of strings is related with other ensembles of the region, like "conjunto calentano", "conjunto de arpa grande", "conjunto de jaraberos" and "conjunto de son de tarima" of the so-called Mexican son.
