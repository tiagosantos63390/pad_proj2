RKO appealed this decision, but in April 1982 the FCC denied its appeal and ordered RKO to surrender the station's license. On May 22, 1982 at midnight, RKO signed off WNAC-TV for the final time. New England Television (NETV), a merger of two of the original rivals to the station's license controlled by Boston grocery magnate David Mugar, took over channel 7 on May 22, 1982 under a new license, signing the channel back on as WNEV-TV; it also dropped the strip-layered "7" logo in favor of a new "SE7EN" logo. RKO then sold the non-license assets of WNAC-TV to NETV; to this day, what is now WHDH operates from the studios on Bulfinch Place, as well as the transmitting tower in Newton, originally built for WNAC-TV.
