The South Sudanese diaspora in Israel advocated for ties to be formalised, and the Israeli government found ways to engage with the regional government of South Sudan, mainly through Mashav, the international cooperation division of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The American Jewish Committee's Africa Institute visited South Sudan in 2008 to meet with government officials and learn of ways in which the diaspora in Israel might be involved in state-building efforts in preparation for South Sudan's independence. The Africa Institute also introduced senior members of the South Sudanese leadership to officials in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
