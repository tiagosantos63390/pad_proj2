From the 1970s onwards various attempts have been made to bring about reunion in North America, but have made little progress outside of the Pacific Coast, where all Christadelphians are now "Central". Reunion efforts continue in the Midwest and Canada.
"Allium cernuum" has an unsheathed slender conical bulb which gradually tapers directly into several keeled grass-like leaves (2–4 mm wide). Each mature bulb bears a single flowering stem, which terminates in a downward nodding umbel of white or rose flowers. Flowers appear in July or August. They are bell-shaped, about 5 mm across, pink or white with yellow pollen and yellow anthers. The flowers mature into spherical crested fruits which later split open to reveal the dark shiny seeds. This plant does not have bulblets in the inflorescence.
