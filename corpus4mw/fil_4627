Sulmeck-Greith is a municipality in the district of Deutschlandsberg in the Austrian state of Styria.
Two problems became evident after the "Leichtgeschütz" (light gun) was fielded. The gas expelled through the venturi of the firing mechanism could cause fouling in the mechanism itself, but fixing this required a redesign of the entire breech and was deemed not worth disrupting the production line or rebuilding the existing guns. The second problem was more serious in that the mounting began to shake itself apart after about 300 rounds were fired. This was principally caused by the torque imparted to the mount when the shell engaged the rifling as well as by the erosion of the nozzles by the combustion gases. These could be countered by welding vanes inside the nozzles that were curved in a direction opposite to the rifling which would then counteract the torque exerted by the shell and minimizing the stress on the gun mount.
A GRD (rasGAP-related domain) follows the IQ domain. This domain is highly similar to the functional subunit of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and was thus thought to have GAP function. IQGAP1 does bind Rho GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, however, IQGAP1 is unusual in that it actually has no GAP function, and instead stabilizes the GTP-bound proteins in their active state.
Three players in particular contributed to that rushing success. Running backs Ken Oxendine, Marcus Parker, and Shyrone Stith combined for 1,831 yards of Tech's total. Oxendine, who missed 2½ games due to injury, accumulated career highs of 890 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Parker, who missed four games due to a discipline-related suspension, earned 467 yards and four touchdowns. Stith, meanwhile, had 474 yards and five touchdowns. Helping block the way for the rushers was center Billy Conaty, who was named an All-American by the Sporting News and who was playing in a then-school record 48th straight game.

Slaves in America had many musical traditions that became important to the music of the country, particularly jazz. The work song was one of these traditions, an improvised system of singing based on the idea of call and response, a central aspect of African music. There were also several instrumental improvisation techniques that were used: after work was done, these people would hold musical performances in which they played on pseudo-instruments made of washtubs and other objects newly used for musical purposes, and also played rhythms on their bodies, called "pattin' juba". The only area that slaves were allowed to perform their music, other than private locations, was a place in New Orleans called Congo Square.
Princess Doreen (1921-1952) was a Thoroughbred racehorse best known for being the top American female money-winner. After showing promising form as a two-year-old she improved to be the best female racehorse of her generation for the next three seasons. Not only did she race males and win, but she did so carrying high weight (often up to 133 pounds) for four years.
Gennadi Ivanovich Shatkov (, May 27, 1932 – January 14, 2009) was a boxer from the USSR, who competed in the Middleweight division (– 75 kg) during the major part of his career.
