Chester Upland School District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided several million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement. Plus since the District is so low performing with high poverty they would have also gotten $750 per pupil. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant.
