Lolly was one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of the distinctive Leslie rotating speaker effect in his electric guitar amplification set-up. Vegas played improvised, jazz-influenced guitar. Drummer Peter DePoe (born 1943, Neah Bay, Washington) is credited with pioneering the "King Kong" style of drumming, which features sharply accented polyrhythms involving the bass and snare drums and is similar to funk styles of drumming. The band referred to DePoe's "King Kong Beat" in their lyrics to the song "Prehistoric Rhythm" on their debut album. Pat Vegas' style of Bass playing is still coveted by bass players in the world, even taught in college courses of music due to the level of creativity each member held.
When a horse is homozygous, meaning it has two copies of the cream allele, the strongest color dilution occurs. 
The color difference in the members is clear and marked. The color of hübnerite has a variation from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown (Errandonea & Segura, 2010). Crystal and crystalline masses of hübnerite show a verity of lusters from adamantine, submetallic to resinous luster (Dutrow & klein, 2007). In thin splints hübnerite can be either transparent or translucent. The streak is related to the color being a shade lighter (King, 2005). All the wolframite family members possess a perfect cleavage on {010}. On {100} and {102} there is less-well developed parting. In hübnerite the fracture is brittle and uneven. Is common for all members of the wolframite to show simple contact twins on {100} or rarely interpenetrant twins on {001}. The hardness of hübnerite is between 4 and 4.5 and specific gravity between 7.12 and 7.18.
