Education.
KOHU changed frequencies to 1360 kHz in 1974 which allowed the station to cover a larger area with the same power output and also allowed the station to use a non-directional antenna during the daytime. The station began to experiment by adding some rock music to the format. However, by 1978 the station was airing the pure country music format that it would air in one form or another for the next three decades.
