The initial bomber force of the Condor Legion, the German volunteer force supporting Franco's Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, was composed of Junkers Ju 52/3m bomber/transport aircraft. These proved vulnerable to Soviet supplied Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters, with the Germans suffering heavy losses, and on 6 January 1937 it was decided to send some of Germany's latest bombers to Spain, both to allow evaluation of the new aircraft in operational conditions and to allow effective use against the Republicans. Four He 111Bs, together with four Dornier Do 17s and four Junkers Ju 86s arrived in Spain in February 1937, equipping a Staffel of "Kampfgruppe" 88.

The song spent 54 weeks on the country music charts, accounting for the longest amount of time spent on that chart. The record held until September 2010, when it was broken by Lee Brice's "Love Like Crazy."
Isochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone that are used alongside monaural beats and binaural beats in the process called brainwave entrainment. At its simplest level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound. The volume or intensity of the sound goes almost directly from 0 to 100 and back again in an evenly-spaced manner. They differ from monaural beats, which are constant sine wave pulses rather than entirely separate pulses of a single tone. Additionally, isochronic tones differ from binaural beats in that they use a single tone, not two. Isochronic tones are usually incorporated or disguised with music, as the undisguised tones can be unpleasant.

Wishing Rocks are boulders, usually a short distance from the main paths, with a flat top: if you throw a pebble and it stays on the top, your wish will come true.

Goerth's remaining victories were from D.VII aircraft as well. On the 16th of September, Goerth shot down Sopwith Camel (B7271) over Zerkegem, West Flanders. Second Lieutenant Edward Burleigh Markquick of the No. 210 Squadron died in that confrontation and is commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Goerth's final two victories (sixth and seventh) both occurred on 1 October 1918. During aerial combat, he first shot down a DH.9 from No. 108 Squadron south of Houthulst, West Flanders and, twenty-five minutes later, a Sopwith Camel from No. 210 Squadron south of Handzame. That day Goerth was piloting a Fokker D.VII marked with a black heart on a white band. Hans Goerth received the Landfliegerabzeichen on 22 May 1918 and the Ehrenrpreis on 28 July 1918. The ace was promoted to Vizeflugmeister in September 1918 and he was the recipient of the Iron Cross First Class.
