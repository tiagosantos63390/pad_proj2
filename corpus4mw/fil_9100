Before he made his first appearance in "Neighbours", Brad was said to be living in America after gaining a basketball scholarship. On his way to Australia, Brad stopped off in the fictional country of Bahgee and was arrested for drug trafficking. His parents, Doug (Terence Donovan) and Pam (Sue Jones), flew out to help him and Brad returned with them to Ramsay Street, where he was reunited with his elder sister, Gaby. The scriptwriters had wanted Brad to be a professional basketball player, but when Michaelson was offered the role, he told them he was a surfer and the character became a "surf bum" instead. On his first day in Erinsborough, Brad went to the beach to catch the waves and Josephine Monroe, author of "Neighbours: The First 10 Years", commented that it was clear Brad was not going to be a high achiever like his siblings.

Petrolini's sympathies for, and impertinences towards, the Fascist regime were complex. Petrolini was admired and befriended by Mussolini, even though his "Nerone" caricature was widely perceived as a parody of the dictator. It has been suggested that the "Nerone" characterfirst created by Petrolini in 1917may actually have influenced Mussolini's own mannerisms. Although a public supporter of the regime, Petrolini did not refrain from satire, including a famously disrespectful rejoinder after Mussolini had presented him with a medal.
