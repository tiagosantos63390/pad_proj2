In 1941, with the American entry into World War II, Marks hoped to again serve the Marine Corps, though not on active duty due to his age. Early in 1942, he returned to Washington where he worked in the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, helping to organize officer training programs for the Navy and Marine Corps. As the war progressed, Marks was selected, due to his background as a military historian, to help write official histories of many Marine Corps victories in the Pacific. In June 1944, Ralph Bard, a Chicago banker like Marks, became Undersecretary of the Navy. The two men, though not close, had been acquainted in the pre-war years, and Bard made Marks his principal deputy with broad responsibilities.
