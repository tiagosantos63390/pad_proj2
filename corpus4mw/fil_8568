Perceived borders similar to the phantom contour, observed via luminance contrasts, were reported in 1987, when Livingstone and Hubel analyzed various aspects of vision, and linked them to the magno- and parvocellular subsystems. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and D.S. Rogers-Ramachandran’s subsequent research, however, helped pare down and solidify the concept of phantom contours. Their research was also the first use of “texture borders” to induce this illusion. Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran’s research has since led to several more papers on the topic, with varying conclusions regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for these illusions, as well as considerations for this illusion’s potential link to dyslexia.

Meanwhile, Washington moved his army northeast from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and crossed the Delaware at Coryell's Ferry. On 23 June, the American army reached Hopewell, New Jersey and moved east to intercept Clinton. After some hesitation, Washington appointed his second-in-command, Charles Lee to lead his advance guard. At 4:00 AM on 28 June 1778, Knyphausen's division began its march from Monmouth Court House, followed at 8:00 AM by Cornwallis' division. Lee failed to scout the terrain and told his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances. He only began moving forward at 7:00 AM with 5,000 troops and 10 cannons. When Lee arrived near the British positions, Clinton turned back to assist his rear guard with strong forces, including the two grenadier battalions. After some attacks miscarried, Lee's division retreated with Clinton in pursuit.
