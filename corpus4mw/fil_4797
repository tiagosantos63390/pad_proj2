The GGRO is one of the few bird research stations in the country where a raptor-counting program and a raptor-banding program operate in the same organization. Started by National Park Service biologist Judd A. Howell, and volunteers S. Williston Shor and Carter L. Faust in the early 1980s, the Raptor Observatory today still operates under the philosophy that incorporating citizens into the process of gathering scientific data will deepen long-term conservation results. Consequently, the organization’s small staff is augmented by the work of 280+ highly trained volunteers, coming from all different disciplines. The GGRO publishes an annual report, contributes annual results to national databases, and collaborates on various research projects with local universities.
