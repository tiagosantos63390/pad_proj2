Ras Koh Hills are the series of complicated high-altitude granite mountain range. The construction of the site was begun in 1979 and completed in 1980 under the supervision of Munir Ahmad Khan and then Member (Technical), PAEC, Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, and Martial Law Administrator of Balochistan Province General Rahimuddin Khan. A 3,325 feet long tunnel was bored in the Ras Koh Hills which was 8–9 feet in diameter and was shaped like a fishhook for it to be self-sealing.
