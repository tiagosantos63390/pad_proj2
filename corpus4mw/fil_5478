This model has a J24B 2.4 litre petrol engine with 4 cylinders, 16 valves DOHC. The 2400 cc engine is capable of producing 185 hp of peak power at 6,500 rpm (manual transmission) and 180 hp at 6,000 rpm (CVT). It produces 170 lb·ft of peak torque at 4,000 rpm. The Maruti Kizashi utilizes a direct ignition system for increased fuel efficiency with decreased emissions. With the help of this and other engine technologies, the car gives 9 km/L in the city and 12 km/L on the highway. The fuel tank capacity of the car is 63 L. Maruti Suzuki though, has not been able to sell many units since the Kizashi is petrol only (running a petrol car in India is expensive compared to a diesel), and the fact that it is expensive there.
YouNoodle's now discontinued "Startup predictor", part of the 2007-2010 entity and developed by Makharinsky and Hwang, uses mathematical models to predict the success of new businesses. The user fills in a questionnaire, which takes about half an hour to complete and concentrates on the business' concept, finances, founders and advisers. Because the procedure is designed for very new companies, questions on revenue and traffic are not included. The site then provides an estimate of what the company's value will be after three years and a score from 1 to 1000 representing its value as an investment. The service is free for the startups themselves, but YouNoodle intends to charge third parties for access to the results. (The level of detail required by the questionnaire makes it difficult for people without inside knowledge of a company to provide the data for a prediction on their own.)

In July, 2001, JMRI began calling one of its subprojects "DecoderPro.". In February, 2004, Katzer purchased the domain decoderpro.com. After this was mentioned on a (non-JMRI) model railroad software mailing list., Jerry Britton (a JMRI user/member) purchased and began using the domain name computerdispatcherpro.com, in apparent violation of Katzer's trademark on Computer Dispatcher. He also threatened to point KAM's computerdispatcherpro.com to a "good porn site". Katzer sued Britton to force him to stop infringing on the computerdispatcherpro.com trademark, and prevent Britton from pointing the domain name to such a site, and Jacobsen asked Katzer to transfer the decoderpro.com domain to him.

In October 2008, McCain proposed that the federal government buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners. For people with 401(k) plans, he wanted to allow more flexibility about when money can be withdrawn, and would lower the tax on that money, as well as lowering the tax on unemployment insurance benefits. McCain also proposed to cut the capital gains tax on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses.

It was quickly evident that the Mustang's performance, although exceptional up to , was markedly reduced at higher altitudes. The single-speed, single-stage supercharger fitted to the Allison V-1710 engine had been designed to produce its maximum power at a low altitude. Above 15,000 feet, the supercharger's critical altitude rating, the power dropped off rapidly. Prior to the Mustang project, the USAAC had Allison concentrate primarily on turbochargers in concert with General Electric; the turbochargers proved to be reliable and capable of providing significant power increases in the P-38 Lightning and other high-altitude aircraft, in particular in the Air Corps's four-engine bombers. Most of the other uses for the Allison were for low-altitude designs, where a simpler supercharger would suffice. Fitting a turbocharger into the Mustang proved impractical, and Allison was forced to use the only supercharger that was available. In spite of this, the Mustang's advanced aerodynamics showed to advantage, as the Mustang Mk I was about faster than contemporary Curtiss P-40 fighters using the same engine (the V-1710-39 producing at , driving a diameter, three-blade Curtiss-Electric propeller). The Mustang Mk I was faster than the Spitfire Mk VC at and faster at , despite the British aircraft's more powerful engine.
"Negro" superseded "colored" as the most polite terminology, at a time when "black" was more offensive. This usage was accepted as normal, even by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as "Negro" in his famous 1963 speech I Have a Dream.
