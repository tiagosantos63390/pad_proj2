The processing of a record is configured in a number of fields that allow scheduling to be periodic, triggered by a hardware event from the I/O, triggered from another record in a processing chain, or triggered by a read reference from another record or a Channel Access write. With this variety of scan mechanism, control and data acquisition strategies can be configured to minimize latency or assure coherence in a configured processing chain such as a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) feedback loop or interlock.

Until 1961, Rickmansworth station was the changeover point from steam to electric locomotives for Metropolitan line trains from Aylesbury (and ) to London. The electrification was then extended north to Amersham and Chesham, leaving Aylesbury services to be served by British Rail Class 115 diesel multiple unit trains (since replaced by Chiltern Railways Class 165 and Class 168 units). Locomotive hauled trains (steam and electric) on the Metropolitan line were then replaced by the new trains of A60 and A62 Stock.
The April 14, 1924, Edition of "Time Magazine" said of Baker:

Making his way into the year 1991, Waverider predicted the futures of numerous heroes, however none of them turned out to be Monarch. When Waverider accidentally came into contact with Captain Atom, the interaction of their powers resulted in a massive amount of temporal energy being unleashed. This created an opening in the quantum field which allowed Monarch, who had been monitoring Waverider's actions the whole time, to travel back in time to ensure his own existence. When Monarch later killed Dove, her partner Hawk became enraged and beat Monarch and unmasked him, only to see that Monarch was Hawk himself.

The kids manage to escape Mr. Chun: Lulu, despite being gagged, manages to create a distraction by making Tyler cry. They awaken Wolfe, who goes to the vault to help Julie, sending the kids to summon the police. Mr. Chun follows them in his car; with Zoe at the wheel, the kids force him to crash. Wolfe figures out how to get past the security system, using a dance ("The Peter Panda Dance") used to make Peter go to sleep each night to avoid its traps. He, Julie, Fawcett, and Mrs. Chun engage in combat, and end the fight when Julie knocks out Mrs. Chun. Wolfe's voice activates the final vault, knocking out Fawcett with the door. By then, the children have lured a large crowd of police to the house. Mr. Chun holds all of them at gunpoint. Wolfe notices school principal and love interest Claire Fletcher (Lauren Graham) right behind him, having followed the chase when she saw it pass by the school. Wolfe, aided by Gary the duck, distracts Mr. Chun, and Claire knocks him unconscious.

I-86 and the old Erie line (now part of the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad) run northeast along the valleys of the Olean Creek and Oil Creek to Cuba (exit 28). From Cuba to Friendship (exit 29), they run through a valley and over a summit, then following the Van Campen Creek northeast to Belvidere (exit 30). At Belvidere, the Erie turns southeast to meet NY 417 at Wellsville, but I-86 continues northeast through the valleys of the Genesee River and Angelica Creek to Angelica (exit 31), and then east along the Angelica Creek, over a summit which is the highest point on the Interstate, and along the Karr Valley Creek to Almond (exit 33).

The new French Revolutionary Calendar also originated during the Republic of Virtue. The first year started on September 22, 1792, the beginning of the Republic. Twelve months of exactly thirty days each received invented names derived from nature. Ten-day "décades" replaced seven-day weeks, allowing for only one day of rest in ten, and eliminating the Sunday of the Christian calendar. This new calendar remained in official use for only nine years until Napoleon discontinued its use on 22 Fructidor an XIII (9 September, 1805).
Embodied Energy is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services, considered as if that energy was incorporated or 'embodied' in the product itself. The concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or energy-saving devices, or the "real" replacement cost of a building, and, because energy-inputs usually entail greenhouse gas emissions, in deciding whether a product contributes to or mitigates global warming. One fundamental purpose for measuring this quantity is to compare the amount of energy produced or saved by the product in question to the amount of energy consumed in producing it.
