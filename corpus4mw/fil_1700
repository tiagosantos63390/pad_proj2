That evening Michael goes to Amanda's house to warn her to get out of town, as he doesn't want to hurt her. He manages to convince her to leave, but while she is packing Billy takes over and approaches Amanda to kill her. Michael's personality manages to reassert itself and he throws himself out of a window in an attempt to protect Amanda from harm. Back at the hospital Michael fearfully begs to be killed because it will soon be too late to stop Billy, who has gone insane in his desire to kill the Curwin bloodline.

When they descend the cellar steps they find a skeleton with a chain wrapped around its leg, and they assume the remains to be those of Billy Connors.

From Belgic names we know that the Belgae were heavily influenced by the Gaulish language, but from other information we know that they were also heavily influenced by Germanic peoples on the east of the Rhine river. In particular, the Condrusi were in the tribal group known as the "Germani cisrhenani", who are amongst the Belgae most strongly associated with Germanic ancestry.

The claim that the coastal inhabitants of Seram are fearful of this animal as is stated in Shuker's book is simply not true: they know nothing of it. The Orang Bati they fear are a tribe with that name in eastern Seram who claim to be able to fly and the story goes they abduct children. The French adventurer Jean Raymond visited and photographed them in 2005 attracted by the stories of the orang bati. These photographs are published in his book Les Molucques (2007). Needless to say they could not fly and did not abduct children; this was a myth they spread to protect themselves by means of fear.

Reductions in Alaskan Air Command forces continued in 1959. In September the Air Force informed AAC that Ladd AFB had been selected along with other bases in the United States for closure. The closure would mean the reassignment of forces at Ladd to nearby Eielson AFB and also some to Elmendorf due to economic necessities. In addition, it was justified that the short runway at Ladd would be compensated by the 14,000 foot runway at Eielson built by SAC. It was also planned that the Army, which maintained units at both Ladd and Eielson, would consolidate its forces, and its northern headquarters, Yukon Command, at Ladd. Discussions and political controversy ensued throughout 1960, however the Army's decision to station a new battle group at Ladd and increase the number of personnel assigned there settled the matter. On 1 January 1961 jurisdiction of Ladd Air Force Base was transferred from the Department of the Air Force to the Department of the Army. The army renamed the facility Fort Wainwright, in Honor of Lieutenant General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV. The airfield, was re-designated as "Ladd Field", in honor of its long Air Force service. With the closure of Ladd, the 449th FIS was inactivated on 25 August 1960, its F-89Js being reassigned to Air Defense Command.
