Early life.

Grey played the lead role, "Chelsea", an escort girl who is paid to act as the clients' girlfriend, in Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh's film "The Girlfriend Experience". Soderbergh cast her after reading the article profiling her in "Los Angeles" magazine, commenting that, "She's kind of a new breed, I think. She doesn't really fit the typical mold of someone who goes into the adult film business...I'd never heard anybody talk about the business the way that she talked about it." In having Grey prepare for her role in "The Girlfriend Experience", Soderbergh asked her to watch Godard's "Vivre sa vie" and "Pierrot le fou". "Vivre sa vie" concerns prostitution, while the relationship portrayed in "Pierrot le fou" was suggested as a model for the dynamic between Chelsea and her boyfriend and clients. Grey and Soderbergh also interviewed two escorts, and borrowed character traits and behavior from them. Critics had mixed assessments of Grey's performance.

Microsoft had stated their intention to eventually merge the Kin and Windows Phone platforms, with downloadable apps then being available for the combined platform.
