The population of the City of Rochester at the 2000 census was 219,773, down 33.9% from its peak in 1950. In 2003 Rochester built a ferry terminal to house the "Spirit of Ontario I". Product of the William A. Johnson, Jr. administration, the "Fast Ferry" was short lived and after troubles with the start-up and operations, newly elected Mayor of Rochester Robert Duffy announced that the city government would be cutting off funds for the ferry. The City sold the "Spirit of Ontario I" at a financial loss in 2007 to the German company FÃ¶rde Reederei Seetouristik Gmbh & Co (FRS) for $29.8 million (US).
