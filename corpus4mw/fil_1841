The baroque trumpet is a musical instrument in the brass family. It was invented in the mid-20th century based on ideas from the natural trumpet of the 16th to 18th centuries and designed to allow modern performers to imitate the earlier instrument for music of that time. Often synonymous with 'natural trumpet', the term 'baroque trumpet' is often used to differentiate an instrument with added vent holes and other modern compromises, with an original or replica natural trumpet which does not.

Yorga reunites Donna with her mother. Michael finds Paul's mutilated body while navigating the crypt. Brudah attacks him, but Michael stabs him—presumably to death. Michael manages to reach the throne room but find Hayes as he lays dying from bites wounds and blood loss, though with his last breath, Hayes tells Michael where Donna is. However the vampiric-Erica and an unnamed, red-headed vampire charge into the room no sooner then Hayes tells him intent on killing the last intruder. Michael fends them off, chasing away the red-headed while Erica oddly pauses, giving Micheal a chance to stake her.
