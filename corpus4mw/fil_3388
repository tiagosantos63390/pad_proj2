Kazys Bizauskas (1893, PƒÅvilosta, Courland Governorate - 26 June 1941) was a Lithuanian statesman, diplomat, author, and one of the twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania.
Klimas attended law school at the University of Moscow. After graduating, he returned to Vilnius and served on the Lithuanian Central Relief Committee. He was elected to the Council of Lithuania in 1917, and signed the Act of Independence in 1918. Klimas went on to serve as the Lithuanian diplomatic envoy to France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Luxembourg.
There is also usually a trade-off between achieving a high level of failure transparency and maintaining an adequate level of system performance. For example, if a distributed system attempts to mask a transient server failure by having the client try to contact the failed server multiple times, performance of the system may be negatively affected. In this case, it would have been preferable to have given up earlier and tried another server.
