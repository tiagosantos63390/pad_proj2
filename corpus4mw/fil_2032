Licklider's research was similar in spirit to his DARPA contemporary and protégé Douglas Engelbart. Both had a view of how computers could be used that was both at odds with the then-prevalent views (which saw them as devices principally useful for computations), and key proponents of the way in which computers are now used (as generic adjuncts to humans).

The Sivas Congress was the first time the fourteen leaders of the movement united under a single roof. These people formed a plan between 16 to 29 October. They agreed that the parliament should meet in Constantinople, even if it were obvious that this parliament could not function under the occupation. It was a great chance to build the base and legitimacy. They decided on formalizing a "Representative Committee" that would handle the distribution and implementation, which could easily be turned into a new government if allies decided to disband the whole Ottoman Governing structure. Mustafa Kemal established two concepts into this programme: independence and integrity. Mustafa Kemal was setting the stage for conditions which would legitimize this organization and illegitimate the Ottoman parliament. These conditions were also mentioned in the Wilsonian rules.

Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised Alphonse's development in the manga, especially where he refuses to recover his weakened body and instead helps his friends.

Chris Beveridge found the character's growth in "Conqueror in Shamballa" appealing as he starts visually resembling Edward. After Aaron Dismuke's voice matured, Anime News Network writer Justin Sevakis criticized him for his part in the "Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection", writing that "he simply no longer sounds like Alphonse".
