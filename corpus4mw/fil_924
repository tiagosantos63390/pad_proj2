Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) can cause severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, it should be given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection.

BHS Football - Belgreen High School is one of the few schools in Alabama that does not have a football program. The reason for this has been debated for years. One story explains the reasoning for this is that a student was killed during a practice, which led to Belgreen being banned from ever playing the sport again. Another depicts Belgreen as being simply too small to have enough young men to play the game.

The next generation, XV60 series Lexus ES was revealed on April 4, 2012 at the New York International Auto Show. For its sixth generation, the model was introduced in gasoline-powered ES 350 and gasoline-electric hybrid ES 300h versions. Despite the fact that the redesigned ES and the 2013 Toyota Camry still share the same platform, the two vehicles are somewhat less mechanically related, as the ES is now based on the Toyota Avalon which is longer than and also shares the same platform with the Camry. The interior added the Lexus Remote Touch interface.

As they travelled homewards, Madocks' letters to Williams and to John Etheridge, who was managing the houses at Morfa Lodge and Tan-yr-Allt, were full of new ideas and instructions to ensure things would be ready for their return. He received a letter from Williams, written in March 1828, confirming that the Glaslyn had finally been diverted, to prevent it eroding the back of the embankment, and his reply to it is his last surviving letter. Having crossed Italy and Switzerland, the party stayed in Paris, where Madocks died on 15 September 1828. No mention of the cause of death appeared in any of his obituaries, and no plaques were erected in his memory. He was buried on 17 September at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

On 16 December the Milanese army reached Magadino on Lake Maggiore about from Bellinzona. However, the Confederates had already retired, after a 14-day siege of Bellinzona, to the Gotthard Pass. Only a 175-strong reserve army, reinforced by about 400 soldiers from the Levantina, were guarding the rear at Giornico in the Levantina valley. The entire Milanese army reached Giornico on 28 December 1478 and outnumbered the defenders by about twenty to one. The defenders were able to defeat the much larger force because the Milanese army was confined in a narrow valley, struggling for foothold on the December snow and ice. The Swiss ambushed the army from above, creating confusion by rolling large boulders down the hillside. They reportedly also wore crampons for better foothold. Against this attack, the Milanese army was helpless regardless of their superior number, and they were forced to flee, leaving an estimated 1,400 dead.

Eager to engage and defeat one of the American 'super-frigates' that had already scored a number of victories over the Royal Navy in single ship confrontations, Broke prepared a challenge. The "President" had already slipped out of the harbour under the cover of fog and had evaded the British. "Constitution" was undergoing extensive repairs and alterations and would not be ready for sea in the foreseeable future. However, "Chesapeake" appeared to be ready to put to sea. 

Creux invented the compressor as a rotary steam engine concept, but the metal casting technology of the period was not sufficiently advanced to construct a working prototype, since a scroll compressor demands very tight tolerances to function effectively. The first practical scroll compressors did not appear on the market until after World War II, when higher-precision machine tools enabled their construction. They were not commercially produced for air conditioning until the early 1980s.

The "Miss Dior Chérie" perfume and the "Dior Homme" fragrance were released in 2005. Galliano released his "Dior Christal" watches in which he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a "creative and innovative collection." Christian Dior S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its "Chiffre Rouge" collection was recognized by the World Watches and Jewelry Show in Basel, Switzerland. Also in the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior. An exhibition, "Christian Dior: Man of the Century," was held in the Dior Museum in Granville, Normandy.
Although in early youth he showed great love of drawing, he began life in a bank and then joined the London Stock Exchange, where he constantly sketched the members and illustrated important events in the financial world; many of these drawings were reproduced by lithography and published for private circulation. In 1879 he began the regular illustration of the Christmas numbers of "Truth", and in 1887 he became a contributor to the "Pall Mall Gazette", transferring his allegiance to the "Westminster Gazette" on its foundation and subsequently acting as assistant editor.

In 1875 Waitz moved to Berlin to succeed Pertz as principal editor of the "Monumenta Germaniae historica". In spite of advancing years the new editor threw himself into the work with all his former vigour, and took journeys to England, France and Italy to collate works preserved in these countries. He died at Berlin on 24 May 1886. He was twice married—in 1842 to a daughter of Schelling the philosopher, and in 1858 to a daughter of General von Hartmann.

The planes attacked the Allied cruisers. The first to be targeted was "Marblehead", and the bombs landed about in front of the ship. During a second attack, "Marblehead" sustained two direct hits and a damaging near miss. The two direct hits penetrated the deck, killed 15 crew directly and destroyed the ship's ability to manoeuver; "Marblehead" was now able only to sail in circles. The near miss also caused a hole , near the bottom of the ship. However, subsequent attacks on "Marblehead" were less intense.
Some of her subjects may have been reluctant to accept an infant king with a queen regent: unlike the Seleucid and Ptolemaic Kingdoms, almost all Indo-Greek rulers were depicted as grown men. This was probably because the kings were required to command armies, as can be seen on their coins where they are often depicted with helmets and spears. Agathokleia seems to have associated herself with Athena, the goddess of war. Athena was also the dynastic deity of the family of Menander, and Agathokleia's prominent position suggests that she was herself the daughter of a king, though she was probably too late to have been a daughter of the Bactrian king Agathocles.
Prince Józef Karol Lubomirski (1638–1702) was a Polish noble.

The 1992 season would feature more improvement for Majerle, who had become an effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist. Despite starting in just 15 of the 82 games he played in, Majerle was selected to play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns once again made the playoffs, but lost in the conference semifinals to Portland. In the offseason, Phoenix managed to pull off a major step towards an NBA Title, as they acquired superstar forward Charles Barkley in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers.

Bagombo Snuff Box is an assortment of short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut published in 1999. The book contains previously published, but uncollected short fiction that did not appear in Vonnegut's previous collection, "Welcome to the Monkey House". Though almost all the stories were initially written and published in the 1950s, for this collection, Vonnegut re-wrote three stories with which he had been dissatisfied. These rewritten stories include "The Powder Blue Dragon" and "Hal Irwin's Magic Lamp".
