The RC45 was shadowed with problems when first released on the World Superbike championship. This did not bode well with Honda, who entered the World Superbike championship with full factory support, not just privateer support that they gave to teams with the RC30. Castrol was the major sponsor of the RC45, and Honda came to win. The RC45 only won one World Superbike championship with American John Kocinski when he won the 1997 FIM Superbike World Championship. Jim Moodie from a standing start, on an RC45 Honda lapped in 18:11.4 seconds, 124.45 mph in the 1999 Isle of Man TT. Miguel Duhamel won the 1995 US AMA Superbike and the 1996 Daytona 200 on an RC45. Miguel came in 2nd in 1996 and 2nd again 1997 on the RC45, then a season ending crash in 1998 injured his leg. However, Ben Bostrom won the 1998 AMA Superbike Championship on an RC45. 
Nordkalottruta or Arctic Trail (Finnish: "Kalottireitti", Swedish: "Nordkalottleden") is a marked hiking trail in the Arctic region of Nordic countries. It has a total length of 800 km and lies along the border of Norway, Sweden and Finland. It begins at Kautokeino (located in Finnmark, Northern Norway) and of the 800 km, 380 km of the trail lies in Norway, 350 km in Sweden and 70 km in Finland. The trail crosses international borders 15 times and ends in the south in Sulitjelma (Norway) or alternately Kvikkjokk (Sweden).
Then, given homogeneous polynomials "f"1...,"f""k" of degrees "r"1...,"r""k" respectively with coefficients in "K", for every set of positive integers "r"1...,"r""k" and every non-negative integer "l", there exists a number ω("r"1...,"r""k","l") such that for "n" ≥ ω("r"1...,"r""k","l") there exists an "l"-dimensional affine subspace "M" of "Kn" (regarded as a vector space over "K") satisfying
