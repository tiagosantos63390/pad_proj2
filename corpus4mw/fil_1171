During the reign of Elizabeth in Russia in the eighteenth century, one branch of the O'Rourkes moved to Livonia, then a province of the Russian Empire. O'Rourke was born at Dorpat in 1772. By this time the family had intermarried and been completely absorbed into Russian high society. According to custom, O'Rourke was immediately enrolled at birth into the Russian Imperial Guard. His father was Count Cornelius O'Rouke, who retired in 1788 with the rank of major-general.
Originally, during the Roman republic, the word "maiestas" was the legal term for the supreme status and dignity of the state, to be respected above everything else. This was crucially defined by the existence of a specific crime, called "laesa maiestas", literally "Violated Majesty" (in English law Lese majesty, via the French Lèse-majesté), consisting of the violation of this supreme status. Various acts such as celebrating a party on a day of public mourning, contempt of the various rites of the state and disloyalty in word or act were punished as crimes against the majesty of the republic. 
The problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century. According to Josephus' account of the siege of Yodfat, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave, the exit of which was blocked by Romans. They chose suicide over capture and decided that they would form a circle and start killing themselves using a step of three. Josephus states that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained the last and gave up to the Romans.
Early Investigations
It is believed that a mantle plume underlies Iceland, of which the hotspot is thought to be the surface expression. This enhances the volcanism already caused by plate separation, both at the centre of the island and at the Reykjanes ridge to the southwest of Iceland's main volcanic zone. The plume is believed to be quite narrow, perhaps 100 km across, and extends down to at least 400–650 km beneath the Earth's surface, and possibly down to the core-mantle boundary.
