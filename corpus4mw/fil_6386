Smith & Wesson continued production with serial numbers as high as 2200 and the rifle was tested by the United States Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground. The Army rejected the design because the rifle was chambered for what was then a non-standard cartridge for the United States military. There was some discussion about redesign to permit full-automatic fire; but production was halted after a total of 1,227 rifles had been manufactured. The short-barreled weapons were considered unsuitable for sale to civilians under the National Firearms Act, so an inventory of 217 remained at the Smith & Wesson factory until a dealer negotiated Curio and Relic Firearms status with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 1975. Firearms collectors subsequently purchased 137 "Mark I" and 80 "Mark II" rifles.
Anthem Visual Effects resumed their duties of producing the visual effects for the second season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season "increased exponentially" over the first, with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots. The produce decided to "re-jig" the opening title sequence, which they wanted to do each year. The photograph where Magnus meets Albert Einstein changed to aviation pilot Amelia Earhart. The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made "more wonderous than we did the season before," as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in "Eulogy" was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in "Hero", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a computer-generated avatar was created. The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.
