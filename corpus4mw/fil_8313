Measurement of airway pressure (Paw), flow (F) and volume (Vol) during mechanical ventilation assists in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure. Airway occlusion technique makes possible to carefully characterize the mechanics of the lung, chest wall, and the total respiratory system. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have a modified elastance due to a stiffer lung or a stiffer chest wall depending in the origin of the disease. Patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin are at greater risk of ventilator lung injury than those of non pulmonary origin.
