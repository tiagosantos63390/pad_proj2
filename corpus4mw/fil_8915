Saffron unifies and connect millions of data points from disparate sources, structured and unstructured, and stores their billions of connections in an associative memory. Users interact with the memory base on a user-friendly interface with both read and write functionality, allowing organizations to index and integrate their data without writing code. The underlying four-dimensional entity store includes advanced analytic functions based on algorithmic information theories such as the Kolmogorov complexity. These analytic functions incorporate classification, predictive analytics and pattern recognition as well as trending and converging patterns in the data. Patterns are presented on a seamless visual interface to the user, enabling organizations to easily identify actionable insights and adapt their strategy to minimize cost and maximize efficiency.
