50P/Arend was observed at its brightest at a maximum magnitude of 14 when it was discovered in 1951. At the comet’s next apparition on September 1, 1959, did not exceed 17 if it had not been for an outburst in November which affected its brightness to magnitude 15.5. The observed orbital period was 7.8 years at the time of its discovery however at each succeeding perihelion has led to less favorable observations due to its 0.64 astronomical units (AU) as it approached Jupiter in 1969, even if its maximum magnitude was 15. This approach also led to the comet’s orbital period to increase to 8.0 years. Long-term motion studies conducted by Brian G. Marsden on the comet 50P/Arend renders the comet’s orbital eccentricity at 0.5 which makes it relatively undisturbed by Jupiter over the last 200-year cycles despite as passage of only 0.49 AU. The study was conducted inside the interval where libration happens. Several comets, namely 50P/Arend, 4P/Faye, 6P/d'Arrest, 22P/Kopff, 36P/Whipple, 78P/Gehrels, 92P/Sanguin, 4015 Wilson-Harrington, and 128P/Shoemaker-Holt, were observed at the Palomar Observatory. Visible coma activity was only observed from 4P/Faye and 50P/Arend out of the 9 other comets from data obtained in May 2000 and March 2001. There have been 1069 observations from October 8, 1951 to February 19, 2008 also where its mean residual is at 0".60.
After graduating from a standard Soviet middle school, Grigoryants briefly volunteered as a chaperone and translator for the Uzbek only speaking youth aspiring to be admitted into Samarkand Medical School (where teaching was in Russian).

Establishing its roots in 1952 as Loudoun County’s first rescue squad, the members of the Hamilton community were volunteering their time and skills long before Station 17 was renamed in 1979. The Hamilton Volunteer Rescue Squad serves the town of Hamilton and its surrounding areas, including Paeonian Springs and Waterford, and are the "second due" units in Purcellville and Leesburg. In addition to BLS & ALS operations, Company 17 also utilizes a boat unit, a heavy rescue unit (Rescue 617), and a bike team. These specialty units are staffed primarily by the HVRS Special Operations Division. Company 17 is supplemented by career staffing during the day, who also operate the county chase unit ALS601 - career personnel put in service a medic unit which operates within the first due, or as the ALS chase for non-first due calls. Hamilton received a new ambulance in October 2013, A617C, which being primarily county owned, deviates from the green color scheme of HVRS, and is red, following county colors. A617C is the primary response unit when LCFR Career Staff are on duty. A617 and A617B are owned and primarily operated by the volunteers of Hamilton Rescue. HVRS also received a Utility unit in late December 2013, also to be operated by the HVRS Special Operations.

. By the summer of 2006, the firm changed its strategic approach and began designing interactive online communities for business. In January, 2007, Filemobile launched the first version of its Media Factory online community management platform and in the fall, CEO Chris Becker and Chief Creative Officer Steve Hulford took on full-time roles in the company. They were joined the following year by President Marc Milgrom and Co-Founder Ron Watson, upon the completion of his successful sale of Poolexpert to Rogers Canada. 

The school has won three state championships in music: 2009–2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012 (Class B).
Climate change can have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive "feedback" process . A feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process. A positive feedback intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it (IPCC, 2007d:78). Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive (Schneider "et al"., 2007:792).
