Čatež was attested in written sources circa 1400 as "Schryetes" (and as "Tschretes" in 1444). Medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was originally "*Črětež", derived from the archaic common noun "*čretež" 'clearing, cleared land', referring to the local geography. A less likely theory is that it is derived from the noun "čret" or "čreta" 'swamp' because the area is not swampy. Rejected etymologies include derivation from "čata" 'ambush' because of evidence from the medieval transcriptions (with "čr-") and the limitation of this lexeme to eastern Slovenia, and derivation from the fairy-tale name "Čatež" for both phonological and typological reasons. In the 19th century the German name was "Tschatesch".
