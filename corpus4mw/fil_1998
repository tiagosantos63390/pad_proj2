These hills are of great cultural and spiritual significance to the San peoples of the Kalahari. They believe the hills are a resting place for the spirits of the deceased and that these spirits will cause misfortune and bad luck if anyone hunts or causes death near the hills. The San people believe these hills to be the site of first Creation. Factually, the San people painted more than 4500 rock paintings against the magnificent stone faces of the Tsodilo Hills, making it one of the most historically significant art sites in the world. The San did most of the paintings, although there are a few by Bantu-speakers whose style differs from that of the San. The exact age of the paintings is not known although some are thought to be more than 20,000 years old. The hills contain 500 individual sites representing thousands of years of human habitation.
The prefecture covered the south-western part of the agglomeration of Athens, several islands in the Saronic Gulf (Salamis, Aegina, Agkistri, Poros, Hydra, Dokos, Spetses, Spetsopoula), Methana and Troizina on the Peloponnese peninsula, and the islands of Kythira and Antikythera south of the Peloponnese. An indication of the geographical diversity of the prefecture was the stark difference in population density between its seven mainland municipalities in the Athens metropolitan area, which have 9,244.2 inhabitants/km², and its detached outlying areas, which average only 85.83 inhabitants/km² (and most of these on Salamis Island, at 395.40/km², while the far-outlying parts have only 47.80/km²).
The social structure of ancient Irish culture was based around the concept of the "fine" (plural "finte"), or family kin-group. All "finte" descended from a common ancestor out to four generations comprised a social unit known as a "dearbhfhine" (plural "dearbhfhinte"). "Túatha" are often described as petty kingdoms. Due to the complex and ever-changing political nature of ancient and medieval Ireland, "túatha" ranged in character from petty kingdoms sovereign in their own right, to areas bound by fealty to much larger "over-kingdoms" such as Connacht or Ulaid. Thus describing their place in the socio-political structure of Ireland is varied depending on the power and influence of the individual dynasties at the time.
The pitcher base is bulbous to ovoid, with the pitcher cup becoming cylindrical in the upper two-thirds to three-quarters. The pitchers are some of the largest in the genus, sometimes exceeding 50 cm in height and 15 cm in width, although they are usually around 30 cm high. Wings at the front of the pitcher cup are either greatly reduced or absent altogether. On the inner surface of the pitcher, the glandular region is present in the bulbous portion. The mouth is elongated into a neck and has an oblique insertion. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 30 mm wide. It bears very highly developed teeth and ribs, the latter reaching 20 mm in diameter. The pitcher lid or operculum is cordate, up to 8 cm wide, and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur up to 20 mm long is inserted near the base of the lid. Pitchers range in colour from light yellow to dark red. The inner surface of the pitcher is usually white, contrasting sharply with the rich colouration of the outer surface. Most parts of the pitcher are very flexible, including the peristome ribs, with only the pitcher base, where the digestive zone is located, being rigid.

Summerville's candidacy was controversial within the party; some believed that his history with large banks was contrary to the NDP's core leftist values, while others believed that he would help rid the party of its image of being financially irresponsible. Most agreed, however, that his twinning of 'prosperity and justice' was a reformulation of long-term party values that have helped position the NDP to take power. It is no coincidence that the issue of fiscal responsibility never came up as an issue for the NDP in the election but in fact was a key criticism of the Conservative Party's platform. More than once on national television Summerville promised that it would be the NDP that would 'keep on eye' on the Conservatives in order to alert the country to a risk of a Conservative Party federal fiscal deficit.

The set includes standards and original tracks, such as "The Holla Day Shuffle," written by her mother Jamecia Bennett. Classics receive R&B arrangements that are alternately modernized ("Li'l Drummer Boy," "Deck the Halls") and kept to low-key contemporary tastefulness ("God Rest Ye Merry," "Silent Night"), while one ("12 Days of Christmas") receives an acoustic jazz backdrop. Bennett was also featured at the San Diego Men's Chorus' (SDMC) 24th annual holiday show on December 6 of 08'.
According to The simExchange, the NPD Group reported that "Crysis" moved 86,633 retail units in the first two weeks of its release in North America, but while it beat their expectations, the sales were considered disappointing overall. Two months later, on Electronic Arts' earnings conference of the quarter, it was reported that Crysis had reached the 1 million units mark, and that it had exceeded their expectations. On the other hand, Cevat Yerli stated during an interview with PC Play in April 2008 that he was disappointed to see the game leading the charts in piracy and because of that his studio would not produce any more PC exclusives, as he believed a game such as "Crysis" would sell four to five times more copies if it was released on consoles. Piracy figures released by TorrentFreak indicate that "Crysis" was indeed one of the most pirated PC games of the year. In June 2008 Cevat stated that while their hopes have not been met, the game has reached their real expectations and in August he added that despite its million budget the game has turned profitable for them. By May 2010 the game has sold over 3 million units (and its standalone expansion about 1.5 million units) making it one of the best selling PC games of all time.

All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.
Below the Bee is a new Sure Start. There are several superficial changes, including that the shape of the reed is different and it is now made of steel. The most substantial change (not visible) is in the carburettor, which now has a large brass spray bar / barrier crossing the round barrel aperture, with a jet hole in its back center. The older carburettor has an abrupt increase in the diameter of the barrel (visible), with the jet at the top of the larger barrel section.
