The Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission (OAC) is an agency of state government that is responsible for promoting aviation in the State. Under the supervision of the Oklahoma Secretary of Transportation, the Commission fosters the growth of the aerospace industry and ensures that the needs of business and communities in the State are met by the State's airports. The Commission encourages the establishment and maintenance of public airports, including the preservation and improvement of the State's 114 public airports.
The importance of this discovery is that the usurper Regalianus is attested only by his coins and a small piece the unreliable "Historia Augusta": the presence, in the early 3rd century, of a consul with the rare "cognomen" Regalianus and belonging to a family whose name begins with 'C' opens the way to some interesting possibilities. A Regalianus descending by this consul might have been appointed governor of Moesia or Pannonia, and have rebelled against Gallienus. This would also solve a problem related to a statement of the "Historia", according to which Regalianus was of equestrian rank, while his governorship required the senatorial rank, as the consulate did.
