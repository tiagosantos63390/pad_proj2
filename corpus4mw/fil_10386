Career.
Labor shortages in the German war economy became critical especially after German defeat in the battle of Stalingrad in 1942â€“1943. This led to the increased use of prisoners as forced laborers in German industries. Following the German invasion and occupation of Polish territory, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens, including teenagers, became laborers in Germany, few by choice. A total of 2.3 millions of Polish citizens, including 300,000 POWs, were deported to Germany as forced laborers. They tended to have to work longer hours for lower wages than their German counterparts.
