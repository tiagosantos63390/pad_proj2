Marine Fighting Squadrons were multirole squadrons responsible for air-to-air combat, combat air patrols, attacking enemy shipping, escorting bombers and close air support. By far the most numerous of any type of Marine Corps squadron, they first made their mark flying the F4F Wildcat as part of the Cactus Air Force on Guadalcanal and finished World War II flying the venerable F4U Corsair. Many VMF squadrons continued to operate after the war with most in the Marine Air Reserve; however, with the retirement of the F-8 Crusader the VMF squadrons either became VMFAs or were deactivated.
