While summering there in 1912, club members of a variety of religious backgrounds including Judaism, Protestantism and Catholicism pooled their resources to build a Catholic church in nearby Portola Valley: Our Lady of the Wayside Church. Architect member James R. Miller assigned the design of the church to a promising young draftsman at his firm, Timothy L. Pflueger. This was Pflueger's first architectural commission, and was the start of his interaction with the Family. Pflueger would soon join the Family to become a member in good standing.

A case can be made that "Mademoiselle de Scudéri" is an example of crime fiction as defined above, but this thesis also is weak (Segebrecht 2001, 1515). The story does briefly deal with the psychology of the criminal (revealed in Olivier's back-story), but Cardillac's pathology plays only a minor role in the plot. Furthermore, the criminal is not known from the beginning. In fact, at least a third of the novella takes place after his death. The reader's interest centers around the question of whether Olivier will be exonerated and reunited with his fiancée, not around whether the murderer or murderers of so many Parisians will be discovered and brought to justice.

British consuls in the United States sought to enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854, in violation of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.

The Real ID, as written today, can be used for “any official purpose” the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security deems appropriate. The 5-11 Campaign does not trust the federal government with this kind of unrestrained, undefined authority. The federal government is violating the 10th amendment by attempting to force the states to comply with Real ID. DHS mandates Real IDs be used for "accessing a Federal facility; boarding Federally-regulated commercial aircraft; and entering nuclear power plants," then adds, "DHS may consider expanding these official purposes through future rulemakings to maximize the security benefits of REAL ID." The Real ID will inevitably expand into a "de facto" National ID card and an internal passport, "used to track and control individuals movements and activities."
