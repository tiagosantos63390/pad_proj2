In 1983, the band began playing sold-out shows in concert hall sized venues like New York's Northstage Theater and Calderone Concert Hall, along with sold-out shows at Brooklyn, NY L'Amour and Queens, NY L'Amour-East clubs. The band also performed a TV-broadcast performance from the Ritz Theater in Elizabeth, New Jersey on the state's TV-3 channel, sponsored by "Good Times" newspaper. Yet, the band did not play live often. As reported in "The Aquarian" newspaper, "Unlike most other developing bands, Americade avoided the club circuit grind by devoting untold hours of rehearsal in a concert setting in an effort to perfect their craft." The much-respected, underground "KickAss Monthly" newsletter put it this way, "Well, like I said in the past, Americade needs to play around to gain some exposure. If the show at L'Amours in Brooklyn on March 11 is any indication of what the band can do in the club scene then they should definitely do a few more gigs before leaving for England. This headbanging outfit hauled in a strapped-down version of their 'Americade Raid' into a club and tore the place to shreds."
