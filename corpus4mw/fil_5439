The first apparent mention, in print form, of a possible Edwards/Hunter affair, appeared in the "New York Post" on August 27, 2007. The page-six feature published a blind gossip item that asked: "Which political candidate enjoys visiting New York because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown?

The ANBI does not have to be a Dutch legal personality. But often the ANBI is a Dutch 'stichting' (foundation), though not every foundation qualifies. It can also be a Dutch "vereniging" (voluntary association).

The ANBI does not have to have registered offices in the Netherlands nor in the EU.
