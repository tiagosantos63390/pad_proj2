Football in Southern Germany, and thereby in Hesse was originally administrated by the "Süddeutscher Fußball-Verband", which was formed on 17 October 1897 in Karlsruhe, then under the name of "Verband Süddeutscher Fußball-Vereine". The new federation soon began to organise a regional football competition, the Southern German football championship, followed by a league system a few years later.

Early life.
The Cabildo created a new executive power, the First Triumvirate, composed of three members: Sarratea, Chiclana and Paso. They were all natives of Buenos Aires, with no members from other cities. The Junta Grande, now working as a legislative power, drafted a set of rules for the division of powers, setting the rules, limits and purposes of the Triumvirate (executive), the Junta itself (legislative) and the Royal Audiencia (judiciary). However, this draft was repealled by the Triumvirate, which though that the Junta held too much power. The Junta was disestablished soon afterwards, and the deputies from other cities removed from Buenos Aires.
