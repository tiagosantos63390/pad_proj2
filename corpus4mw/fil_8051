A happily married couple, Ellie (Kirstie Alley) and Nick Denato (Lee Horsley) are living in the wildlife of Africa with their young daughter Melissa (Lindsay Parker). Even though they have everything that they had ever wanted there, they return to San Francisco so Nick can focus on his career as a photographer and she can give birth to their second child. Soon, life goes on a downward spiral for the high-powered, two-career couple, as Ellie is not satisfied in their surroundings. She misses her life as a doctor in Africa and suspects that Nick is not faithful to her when Scott's young and attractive assistant Robin (Courtney Thorne-Smith) arrives. When his partner Scott (Robert Englund) convinces Nick to go on a business trip to Nepal for six weeks, she reluctantly accepts the situation.
