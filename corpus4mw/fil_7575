The campaign was flawed from the start since it was known that he opposed the 1920 strike and sided with planters. It was also known that the plantations were providing Okumura and his colleagues with facilities and paying their expenses, Okumura’s close relations with the planters raised distrust amongst the Japanese. The Japanese unionists began to reject Okumura as a “traitor” and “betrayer”. Many did not go the programs and those who did found it teaching them to become subservient workers. Amongst Okumura’s teachings was to reject materialism and value their role in society, this had an adverse reaction from an audience with little possessions and low social status and Okumura was accused of being a propagandist for the wealthy social elite. Buddhist priests were irate to discover the Christian agenda to converting Buddhists and that Umetaro Okumura was discussing with the planters to restrict Buddhist practices and close Buddhist churches on plantation land. Okumura was also known for his offensive remarks toward Buddhists “alien” and “pagan”. Instead of attracting the Japanese to Christianity to correct their spiritual flaws, the criticisms deepened their devotion to Buddhism or Shintoism and rejected Christianity.
