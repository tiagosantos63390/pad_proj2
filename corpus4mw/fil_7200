A first preview of Translation eXchange (now SOLAS Match), a major component developed as part of The Rosetta Foundation technology platform in collaboration with the Centre for Next Generation Localisation (CNGL), was given in a webinar by Reinhard Schäler and Eoin O Conchúir on 17 May 2011. SOLAS Match is an open source component of the Service Oriented Localisation Technology Platform SOLAS developed at the University of Limerick and is based on ideas developed at The Rosetta Foundation Design Fest in San Francisco, 5–6 February 2012, by around 25 localisation experts supporting The Rosetta Foundation's mission. SOLAS Match is a highly innovative way to easily match translation projects with volunteers' expertise and interests.
After the Korean War the Surgeon General's Office applied itself to assessing the potential of helicopter ambulances in future conflicts. In particular, Lt. Col. Neel, in a number of medical and aviation journals, publicized and promoted the Army's air ambulances. The Korean experience, he realized, could not serve as an infallible guide to the use of helicopters in other types of wars and different geographical regions, but it certainly showed that helicopters had made possible at least a modification of the first links in Letterman's chain of evacuation. A superior communications system would allow a well-equipped and well-staffed ambulance to land at or near the site of the wounding, making much ground evacuation unnecessary. If the patient's condition could be stabilized briefly, it might prove helpful to use the speed of the helicopter to evacuate the patient farther to the rear, to more complete medical facilities than those provided at a rudimentary division clearing station. Triage might be carried out better at a hospital than in the field.
