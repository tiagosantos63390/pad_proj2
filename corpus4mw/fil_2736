"Atlantic Causeway" disembarked 12 Wessexes of 847 NAS on 1 June 1982, with the detachment from "Engadine" arriving on 9 June. The squadron's Wessexes, together with those of 845 NAS initially operated from San Carlos and provided much needed transport support to the advance of British forces on Port Stanley, with forward operating bases being set up at Teal Inlet and Fitzroy.

The economy of Müllheim was characterized by wine, fruit, flax and hemp production as well as forestry and dairy farming and cheese making. The municipality had several handicraft businesses and restaurants, as well as two annual fairs. The train station Müllheim-Wigoltingen opened in 1855. This train station encouraged the construction in 1857 of a canvas factory in Grüneck. In 1979 this became the weaving factory of Grüneta AG, which went bankrupt in 2004. TheU tilis Müllheim tool factory was founded in 1870 and employed 40 staff in 2000. Other businesses in the municipality included an embroidery factory in 1900, a wood turning plant that was open between 1909–16 and a machine shop from 1906-09. Since 1954, a local company manufactures steel furniture, another has recycled industrial waste since 1991.
The earliest traces of human settlement come from the Stone Age and there are scattered Bronze Age items around Berg. The modern village of Berg is first mentioned in 796 as "Berga". In the Early Middle Ages, Berg and the surrounding land were in the possession of the Bishop of Constance and were on the southern border of the Bishop's land. A fortress was first built in the 12th-13th Century, which was replaced in 1600 by a castle. The castle and the rights to rule over the villages of Berg, Andhausen, Donzhausen and parts of Andwil (TG), Mauren and Mattwil were rented out by the Cathedral of Constance (not the Bishop) until 1798. The circumstances behind the removal of the diocese's administration and the emergence of the court in 1386 are unclear. Some of the owners of the village included Egli von Zug (1518–67), Brümsi von Herblingen (1586-1653/56) and the von Thurn-Valsassina family (1676–1798). 
The following day, McNulty arrives late at the unit office and finds ASA Pearlman and Daniels receiving a briefing on Freamon and Prez's analysis of the burners. They have identified a communication network with 15 distinct phone users by analyzing the call pattern. None of the phones identified list any user information because they are all prepaid "burner" phones purchased anonymously with cash. They have identified a coordinator at the top of the pyramid, who acts as a nexus for communications. The detectives have also found that the phones are pre-programmed with the numbers before being put into use. Freamon asks Greggs to have the Western DEU squad collect phones for them.
