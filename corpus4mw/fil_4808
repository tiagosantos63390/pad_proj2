The words of the exhortation are the same as in the "editio princeps" of the Roman Missal issued by Pope Pius V in 1570. At a later stage, editions of the Tridentine Roman Missal introduced a rubric absent in the original, directing the priest to say the "Orate fratres" exhortation with his voice "raised a little" ("voce paululum elevata"), an indication that, unlike the "Oremus", it was not to be sung, and a proof that it is not part of the old Roman Mass. This limitation was removed in the 1970 edition. When it was still the rule, Adrian Fortescue remarked: "Certainly nowhere is the whispered voice so anomalous as here, where we address the people. If the "Orate fratres" were an old integral part of the Mass, it would of course be sung loud."

DLC and a content creating and sharing user base are essential long-term needs in more complex simulator products such as V-scale model railroading applications (such as Trainz, RailWorks, and MSTS) where in the long term, much of the allure comes from the ability to build new layouts or expand others, including writing customized the "game play" like operating modules. Since 3D asset generation is typically a technically demanding and time consuming activity—a steam locomotive can take 2–4 full months of time to implement, and a long large route can consume years of development—such emulations only grow through the power of numbers of the many producing and sharing assets in the hobby community.
