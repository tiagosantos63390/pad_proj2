Along the trip, Milla shows no signs of being any nicer to Tal, only concerned with what she has been told to do, and that is to keep Tal alive and bring back a Sunstone for her clan. They encounter a large horned creature called a Merwin. Milla shows reckless bravery as she viciously fights it. She manages to kill it, with some help from Tal, yet sustains a massive gash across her side. Tal's shadowguard heals the wound partially before a group of Shield Maidens discover and rescue the pair. They take them to the Ruin Ship, the central most important ship of the Icecarls, and heal her completely. After a few days, Milla and Tal set off again.
