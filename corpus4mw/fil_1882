The bulk of Auklandus' fame rests with her work on the Elfquest series, one of the earliest independent comic titles in North America. Her first tenure with Warp Graphics, the publisher of Elfquest, ran from 1983–88, when she served as administrative director and associate editor. In 1994, she was approached by series' creators, Wendy Pini and Richard Pini, to edit and write spin-off series, including "Hidden Years" (1993–96), "The Wild Hunt" (1996–98), "Kahvi" (1995–96), and editing work on "The Wolfrider's Guide to the World of Two Moons." 
"Mystery Train" was filmed in Memphis in the Summer of 1988. After arriving in the city during a snowstorm to scout for shooting locations, Jarmusch drove around without direction before coming to the intersection of a disused train station, the Arcade Luncheonette diner, and the dilapidated Arcade Hotel that would become the film's core setting. He would later recount the experience in a March 1990 interview in "Spin": "Man, ... this crossroad is filled with so many ghosts. You know Robert Johnson walked down that street, you know Muddy Waters was in that train station." The locale of the intersection was one of the film's primary formal elements; the effect of Jarmusch returning to the setting with different characters under different circumstances was one of variations on a theme.
