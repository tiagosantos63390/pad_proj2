After erecting the first home in what would become downtown Seattle (the previous structures had been at Alki), the couple participated in the early life of Seattle and had two more children, William Richard (October 4, 1854 – January 19, 1899) and Mary Louise (May 3, 1857 – January 1, 1926). In 1855 they sold this property, along with a claim extending uphill from the waterfront between what are now James and Marion Streets, to Edward Lander and Charles Terry. The couple argued over Carson's constant hunting trips and giveaways, and by 1860 they separated. They were divorced by territorial legislative act December 17, 1861. Their children were raised by the Dennys. Mary Ann went south to The Dalles, Oregon, and established a dressmaking business. There she had another daughter, Lydia Dell Blakeney (January 18, 1869 – October 6, 1921) with John William Blakeney, a divorced man; they married in November 1872, but separated about 1880 and divorced in 1884. Mary Ann and Lydia moved back to Seattle.

On January 25, 2013, Kottaras was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Royals. In 2013, his locker was assigned next to Mike Moustakas, who is also of Greek descent.

He was designated for assignment on November 21, 2013.
Later came the Nazi régime, which used "Der Hochwächter" and the "Echo vom Hochfirst", the local newspapers, for their own ends, later shutting them both down. Despite exerting this influence, the Party's share of the vote in Neustadt was always lower than in Titisee, where it compared with the national average. Nevertheless, the NSDAP local moved into the town hall in 1933, occupied its balcony and made an example of a few people in public life by removing them from office or sending them to the local concentration camp near Hüfingen. Blasius Müßle, who became mayor at that time, was replaced in 1935 by the later "Kreisleiter" (District Leader) Benedikt Kuner.
