The average annual temperature is 8.4 °C, with a January mean of -10.4 °C and an August mean of 24.2 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1300 mm, making for a comparatively cool and wet climate. Due to the mountainous terrain, only 17% of the county's land is cultivated, while 74% is occupied by forestland.
