Themes.
The Liceo M.A. Vassalli is situated in Tal-Ħandaq, Qormi (Malta) on the site of the former Royal Naval School Tal-Handaq (1947 - 1978). The Junior Lyceum was founded in 1981, and offers secondary education to male students aged 10 to 16. The school complex is characterized by Nissen huts and small blocks in a random layout. Having formerly been a barracks during World War II this layout intended to give the site resemblance with a Maltese village, in order to give camouflage from the air.

Goff reviewed the area of law. A judge may decline to take a case where there is another jurisdiction that is more suitable for the parties. However, the burden is on the claimant to establish that the foreign forum is clearly or distinctly better. Many factors can be considered to determine the "natural forum" including the availability of witnesses, the applicable law of the matter, the parties' residence or place of business, and the possibility for the plaintiff to obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction. If a party makes out a claim for a natural forum the opposing side may rebut the claim by showing that justice requires the matter to be heard in the domestic court, otherwise justice would not be done.

During construction part of Tullycarnet Park (currently unused) was used to facilitate building equipment and materials so as to cause as little disruption to school activities as possible. Design proposals and timelines facilitated the original idea of using the main buildings now for teaching whilst the new building was being constructed. The new building will be much more environmentally friendly than the previous, using design techniques to manipulate the sun for heating and ventilation as well as rainwater being recycled. Sensors will monitor the quality and temperature of the air to control cooling, heating and recycling. There will also be light sensors to adjust electrical lighting depending on how much sunlight is entering the room.

Service history.
After moving to Los Angeles, Denton continued to perform on stage, usually during hiatus from whichever TV series to which he was attached at the time, and many of the plays, as well as the independent movies in which JD has appeared, have been written by his good friend, Mike Petty. For example, "In Walked Monk", in which JD played the role of "Steven" during the summer of 1999, was written by Mike Petty, as was "Locked Up Down Shorty's", in which JD played the role of "Danny", during the summer of 2001.

In the beginning of Heinrich Böll's book, and at the end of Schlöndorff's cinematic interpretation of it, the following text appears:
In his assignment to Saint Mary’s, Brother Norman had been given a mandate to “close it up or build it up!” The school community chose transformation. “The possible demise of Saint Mary’s and its embodiment of the Lasallian vision,” Brother Norman reflected years later, “was simply an unacceptable option.” Work began on a facilities master plan and a major fundraising campaign. The Shea Student Center was completed in 1977 and the Brothers Residence in 1978. A later campaign funded the 1986 construction of science and math classrooms in Murphy Hall.
