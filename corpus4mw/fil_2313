In her maiden speech O'Neil placed an emphasis on the importance of a strong economy in effecting a fair society and stemming disadvantage. She stated that whilst she believed "government should not be building great tariff walls or controlling the big macroeconomic levers", it did in practice provide "the platform on which our businesses compete — and win — globally" and that political leaders must therefore play a role in providing "good policy and clear communication" on the topic. O'Neil cites her family's history, work at McKinsey & Company, and experiences in indigenous communities as influencial in shaping her views on the economy.

The late 1990s saw a resurgence in his financial situation and fame. In 2001, he completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters.

The B-37, given the service name "Firebrand" on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the main fuel tank and the auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly-cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually-folded outer panels (with 5 degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically-powered Fowler flaps that extended to the edges of the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The vertical stabilizer and rudder were positioned forward of the horizontal stabilizer to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in that there was an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, presaging the development of the modern heads-up display.

In 1968 the new triples disappointed the American BSA-Triumph management, who knew that Honda had a motorcycle under development. They felt the price of $1,800 (£895) was too high, and technical details (like vertically-split crankcases and a pushrod OHV valve train were too conventional. However, they acknowledged that the bike was fast and the US sales team launched it by setting speed records at Daytona (which were only broken in 1971 by the Kawasaki Z1).

He holds a doctorate in social sciences obtained from the University of Sarajevo His thesis claims that the Maya are older than the Olmec and that their culture mysteriously ceased to exist after the 10th century CE. He also discusses in some detail the Maya crystal skulls saying that they were created by advanced technology and discussing the alleged psychological and parapsychological phenomena surrounding them. He suggests that the Maya had contact with the Chinese on the basis of what he says is nephrite (found in China, not in South America in a jaguar statue, although others identify the material as jadeite.)

Bolotsky and Godefroit (2004) found the paleobiogeographic implications interesting. The relationship they described provides additional support for land links and faunal interchange between eastern Asia and North America at the end of the Cretaceous, as the other two genera are either known only in North America or are known from a species there. The "sauroloph" group would have had to split from the nest closest group, the "edmontosaur" group, in the early Campanian, from Asia, and moved west while leaving a splinter population that would lead to "Kerberosaurus", then return to Asia at a later point and produce "Saurolophus angustirostris". 
In its natural habitat, "N. papuana" grows in exposed sites at forest edges. Lower pitchers frequently develop embedded in moss. The species occurs sympatrically with "N. ampullaria", "N. insignis", "N. maxima", and "N. mirabilis". Despite this, no natural hybrids involving "N. papuana" have been recorded to date.

Interestingly, the first Commando leader was John Frederick Durnford-Slater, author of the autobiographical Commando: Memoirs of a Fighting Commando in World War Two. Henriques’ charismatic Territorial colonel, and then Commando leader is similarly hyphenated, “George Hatherly-Cooke”. Most of Hatherly-Cooke’s fighting doctrines (such as, the night is never too dark to see, and pocket torches ruin night vision, …) are famously those of Durnford-Slater! The Letter was Durnford-Slater's way of escape from a stultifying post in an anti-aircraft battery.
