By June 14, 2010, the directory portion of “the Green Guide” had over 15,000 entries, however, only just over 10,000 are available to view online. This is because not all of the potential entries are accepted by “the Green Guide” due to the fact that they do not match the standards the guide has set. One of the major problems organizations like “the Green Guide” face is the issue of green washing. Green washing is the issue of companies attempting display themselves as environmentally friendly or green just to gain customers when in fact they are not at all green. This can be an enormous concern as companies like “the Green Guide” try their best to create guides full of truly sustainable companies. For this reason “the Green Guide” is always asking for feedback and any information that can help them enhance their guide.

"Mrs. California" received mixed responses from critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had the possibility of being a great episode of "The Office", but that it didn't live up to that possibility. He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but couldn't successfully "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in "Lotto". He ultimately gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over "Gettysburg" and also called it possibly her "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of "New York" called Robert California the worst part of "The Office" and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. "TV Guide" writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode didn't feel like "The Office" and called it "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from "What Culture?" gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, "I’m going to go out on a bit of a limb here and say that while “Mrs. California” was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was a good example of how the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. After viewing "Mrs. California," "Washington Post" writer Hank Stuever named "The Office" one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.
