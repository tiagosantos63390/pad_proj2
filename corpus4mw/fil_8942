Tensions flare at the top model house when Kristin goes to Destiny's bag to get a lighter without asking for her permission, Kristin then dared Destiny to punch her in the face so that she can send Destiny home. Then the girls meet 3rd Street at Tyler Perry Promenade in Santa Monica Boulevard for an acting challenge where Tyra and Tyler will tell the girls what to do with respect to the persona they've randomly picked. Kiara, Laura and Yvonne got high scores, Victoria made a tourist mad at her and thrown food at her while Destiny and Leila struggled. Kiara won the challenge and got a role in a Tyler Perry production which some of the models predicted because she's what is she portraying already.
