Camp Baird is the base camp for the Lenhok'sin High Adventure program. Scouts can choose from a traditional backpacking trek, a Civil War week, a canoe trek, or a "COPE and Rope" trek. In a traditional trek scouts hike from outpost to outpost during the week and experience various activities with significance to history or high adventure sports. Scouts are on the trek from Monday morning to Friday afternoon. Throughout the week, crews may be found at the outposts, which are scattered around the reservation. LHA is recommended for scouts at or above the age of 13, and in decent physical condition. Crews should be well prepared for their week of backpacking and must have a minimum of two youth and two adults, no exceptions. Units with numbers above 14 may be split into two individually functioning crews, so if a crew intends to bring more scouts on Trail, plans should be made to bring more than two or three adults.

The event is officially styled by the FIA/DMSB as a "Leistungsprüfung 200km" ("LP200", performance test over 200 km). This means that the RCN is not a race for positions among cars that are started at once from a grid (like VLN endurance races), but a time trial, with cars being started one by one, about 5 seconds apart. This reduces the risks of collisions, as there is no benefit for a racer to defend his or her position.
While British fans received a flexi-disc in an elaborate sleeve, American fans received a postcard similar to that of 1966.

Assimilation works with "-val/-vel" and "-vá/-vé": the initial sound of these suffixes will change to the preceding sound, if it is a consonant other than "v", e.g. "lakás" + "-val" appears as "lakással". (In words ending in a vowel or "v", there is no change, e.g. "sáv|val" "with the lane", "hajó|val" "with the ship".)

Meningococcal disease causes life-threatening meningitis and sepsis conditions. In the case of meningitis, bacteria attack the lining between the brain and skull called the meninges. Infected fluid from the meninges then passes into the spinal cord, causing symptoms including stiff neck, fever and rashes. The meninges (and sometimes the brain itself) begin to swell, which affects the central nervous system.

The royal touch was not the only "miraculous" healing power attributed to European rulers. Members of the House of Habsburg were believed to be able to cure stuttering by a mouth-kiss. The medieval monarchs of Castile were reputed to possess the ability to exorcise demons by making the sign of the cross and calling on God, while their Hungarian counterparts supposedly cured jaundice. Similarly, English monarchs distributed cramp-rings, which were said to be a cure for "diabolical" sicknesses such as cramps and epilepsy.

Until recently, scientists could make only an educated guess as to why a twinned rainbow does appear, even though extremely rarely. It was thought that most probably non-spherical raindrops produced one or both bows, with surface tension forces keeping small raindrops spherical, while large drops were flattened by air resistance; or that they might even oscillate between flattened and elongated spheroids. However, in 2012 a new technique was used to simulate rainbows, enabling the accurate simulation of non-spherical particles. Besides twinned rainbows, this technique can also be used to simulate many different rainbow phenomena including double rainbows and supernumerary bows.
It is named in honor of Keith 'Bluey' Truscott, a former dual premiership player and World War II fighter ace killed in 1943.

The title is based on the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. A small part of the episode is a reference to "Indiana Jones." For example, the way Homer dresses is referent to what Mola Ram wears in the Indy film "Temple of Doom." As well, the people chant to Homer in a similar way they do for Ram in the film, and India portion of the episode is similar to Temple of Doom overall. The scene in which the Simpsons along with Smithers and Burns travel up the river is a direct reference to the PT boat in "Apocalypse Now" and the Indian's apparent worship of Homer is also a reference to this film.

The birthdate of Mother Ignacia del Espíritu Santo is piously attributed on February 1, 1663, based on the cultural customs of the Spanish Era. Only her baptismal record is preserved, which occurred on March 4, 1663. Ignacia was christened in the "Church of the Holy Kings in the fifth Parián de Chinos" by Fray Padre Alberto Collares, O.P.

The data from Eagle Four's on-board computer shows Tora to be a mass of dust and atmospheric gasses, with electrical storm activity and various precipitations forming a freakish 'weather belt'. The Moon could pass straight through...unless it contains a solid centre. With that threat, Koenig prepares a reconnaissance mission. In the Medical Centre, Sanderson rejects Helena's treatment, assaults the guards and escapes. Confronting Koenig, he insists Tora's true nature has been suppressed to prevent them settling there; as long as the Alphans remain on the wandering Moon, 'Commander Koenig's dictatorship' is safe.

During World War I, the division was composed of the 19th, 62nd and 118th Infantry Regiments, the 116th Infantry Regiment (to November 1917), and the 7th Territorial Infantry Regiment (from August 1918). It was originally part of the French 11th Corps (CA).

Jalfrezi (also "jhal frezi", "zalfrezi", "jaffrazi", and many alternative spellings) is a type of curry which involves frying marinated pieces of meat, fish or vegetables in oil and spices to produce a dry, thick sauce. As the dish includes green chillies, a jalfrezi can range in heat from a medium dish to a very hot one. Typically those eating jalfrezi cool it down by combining it with cream. Other main ingredients include bell pepper, onion and tomato.
Decennalia (or decennia, from Latin "decennium" - "tenth anniversary"; "decem", "ten" + "annus", "year") were Ancient Roman festivals celebrated with games every ten years by the Roman emperors.

Juliana and her twin sister Agnes were born in the village of Retinnes in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. They were orphaned at age five and placed in a newly founded hospice at Mont-Cornillon, right outside of Liège. The canonry seems to have been established on the model of a double monastery, with both canons and canonesses, each living in their own wing of the monastery. The two girls were initially placed on a small farm next to the canonry. Juliana, after entering the Order at the age of 13, worked for many years in its leprosarium. Agnes seems to have died young, as there is no further mention of her in the archives.

Analysis of the Chinon Parchment, as well as other materials of the Templar trials, enabled Barbara Frale to theorize on some of the secret initiation practices of the Templars. While three of the accused admitted to having been asked by their receptors during their initiation to denounce the Cross and spit upon the crucifix, their stories are inconsistent. Geoffroy de Gonneville, for example, stated that he had not succumbed under duress to denouncing and spitting on the Cross; despite this, he was admitted to the order, implying that the denial of the cross may have been a test of some sort. The other accused men admitted to "denouncing in words only, not in spirit". Gordon Napier thinks that the practice of the denial of the cross was training for what the new knights might later face, were they taken prisoner by Saracens.

In 1991, Neiland captured the Wimbledon title with Zvereva. In 1992, she lost in the U.S. Open final to Jana Novotná and Helena Suková. She won her first mixed doubles title at Wimbledon, as well, when she and Cyril Suk teamed and won over Dutch duo Jacco Eltingh and Miriam Oremans. That year, she reached the number one doubles ranking. Neiland then reached her next five doubles runners-up with Novotná. Each and every final played with Novotná was lost, the first being the U.S. Open in 1991 and losing to Pam Shriver and Zvereva.

The right-handed Beckwith battled fellow Negro League third baseman Jud Wilson for supremacy at that position during the 1920s. For the years he didn't play third, he was also an All-Star shortstop, though much of his value and playing time occurred at third base. Defensively, it appears that he was steady with the glove based on anecdotal evidence, though not outstanding.

Railroads became an important economic force in Illinois in the 1850s. As they expanded they created myriad legal issues regarding “charters and franchises; problems relating to right-of- way; problems concerning evaluation and taxation; problems relating to the duties of common carriers and the rights of passengers; problems concerning merger, consolidation, and receivership.” Lincoln and other attorneys would soon find that railroad litigation was a major source of income. Like the slave cases, sometimes Lincoln would represent the railroads and sometimes he would represent their adversaries. He had no legal or political agenda that was reflected in his choice of clients. Herndon referred to Lincoln as “purely and entirely a case lawyer.”
Invited many decades later to receive an honorary degree by a Canadian university, the retired Emile decides to take an extended visit to Victoria, British Columbia to try to get to know Carl's now adult daughter Nadia (Deborah Kara Unger, who also briefly portrays Carl's wife) who has recently separated from her husband, and her ten-year old daughter Maria (Theo Crane, who also portrays the ten-year old Nadia) before it is too late. The discovery of his ancient typewriter amongst Nadia's belongings triggers a series of reveries, half memory, half fantasy, in which Emile's unresolved feelings about the past come back to haunt him.
The role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of New Media, and an ever-growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities, especially on the Internet to create independent content. Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds, artists, techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media. The active, participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media, tools and applications, and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences.
