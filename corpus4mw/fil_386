Many contend that from its earliest days, Christianity followed the Hebrew tradition of condemnation of male sexual intercourse and certain forms of sexual relations between men and women, labeling both as "sodomy." Some contemporary Christian scholars dispute this however. The teachings of Jesus Christ encouraged a turning away from and forgiveness of sin, including those sins of sexual impurity, although Jesus never referred to homosexuality specifically.

Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and antiheroes who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Omura's whale (henceforth "B. omurai") has several unique skeletal features that distinguish it from its congeners, namely "B. brydei" and "B. edeni". In "B. omurai" and "B. brydei", the posterior end of the ascending process of the maxilla widens to become squarish, whereas in "B. edeni" it is slender and round throughout its length. In "B. omurai", this widened posterior portion conceals the premaxilla, which disappears below the maxilla and nasal and does not reach the frontal, whereas in both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni" the premaxilla reaches the frontal. The parietals flare laterally in dorsal view in "B. omurai" and the Indo-Pacific form of "B. brydei", but are invisible in dorsal view in "B. edeni" and the North Pacific form of "B. brydei". "B. omurai" has two small foramina "along the suture between the parietal and squamosal in the posterior wall of the temporal fossa", which both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni" lack. "B. omurai" has an oblique ridge on the dorsal side of the maxilla near the base of the rostrum, which is absent in both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni". Unlike "B. edeni", the alisphenoid is separate from the squamosal in "B. omurai". The head of the first rib is not bifurcated in "B. omurai", unlike "B. brydei" and "B. edeni".
