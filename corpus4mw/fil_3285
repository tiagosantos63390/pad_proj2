Election history.

The Horned Frogs played basketball in the Southwest Conference from the 1923-24 seasons until the breakup of the conference after the 1995-96 season. During their time in the SWC they won 10 conference titles (1931, 1934, 1951*, 1952, 1953, 1959, 1968, 1971, 1986*, 1987; * denotes shared title). Buster Brannon owns the most wins as a coach in TCU Men's Basketball history with a career that spanned 20 years he earned a record of 205-259, a 104-144 record in SWC play, won 4 conference titles and earned three trips to the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1952, 1953 and 1959. The TCU Men's Basketball Team would only win one more conference championship after the breakup of the Southwest Conference. During the 1997-98 season under Coach Billy Tubbs, the team went 27-6 and 14-0 in WAC play. The team earned a trip to the Midwest Regional played in Oklahoma City, OK. They would lose in the first round to Florida State. TCU never won a title during their time in Conference USA or the Mountain West Conference. How they will fare in the Big 12 remains to be seen.

Historical development.
Gameplay and premise.
Valla sadya is conducted by the devotees as a “Vazhipadu” to the lord ParthaSarathy. The Valla sadya is dedicated to any of the boat. On the valla sadya day, the oarsmen will come to the Temple in the boat through the river. The oarsmen offered Nirapara to the presiding deity at the Nadappanthal in front of the golden temple mast and went round the temple chanting Krishna bhajans (Vanchi pattu). The entire atmosphere was charged with the rhythmic vanchi pattu, songs in praise of Lord ParthaSarathy. The `vallasadya' began immediately after the utcha pooja at the temple. They were given a rousing reception. They circumambulated the temple, chanting the `vanchi pattu', verses in praise of Lord Krishna, before partaking of the valla sadya.
Fitzgrave says that he has written a long speech in Latin, which Pursenet's Boy will recite during the masque. The speech will further expound on each gallant's true nature (note: Fitzgrave's strategy hinges on the gallants' ignorance of Latin; they will not understand the speech or the text written on their shields). Goldstone, Pursenet, Tailby, Frip, Primero and Pursenet's Boy enter. Fitzgrave shows them their shields and leads them to believe that the Latin inscriptions are favorable. For example, he tells Pursenet that the inscription on his shield (which shows a purse turned upside down) means "Your bounty pours itself open to all men." The gallants approve of the shields. They rehearse the masque with Pursenet's Boy.
