William Kenny was born in Delhi, New York, to John and Ann (née McDonough) Kenny. His youth was spent in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in newspaper work, and, when he had saved sufficient money to defray the expenses of his seminary education, he returned to New York and entered St. Bonaventure University near Olean. On January 15, 1879, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Moore for the Diocese of St. Augustine in Florida. After a short residence in Jacksonville, he was given charge of the mission in Palatka, where he remained for three years. In June 1884, Kenny was named pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Jacksonville. During his tenure as pastor, he became active in civic organizations and community service associations, and led relief efforts during the yellow fever outbreaks and Great Fire of 1901. He also became vicar general of the diocese in 1889.
