"Shake Your Pom Pom" is a song by Missy Elliott, and is a single from the "Step Up 2 the Streets soundtrack". It was also supposed to appear on Elliott's forthcoming album "Block Party". The song was released in Germany and the U.S. 
To celebrate the centenary of the railways in Germany in 1935 a replica of the "Adler" was built beginning from 1933 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the Kaiserslautern repair shop ("Ausbesserungswerk"), which was largely true to the original. The original idea of the President of the Reichsbahn Julius Dorpmüller and the members of his staff was to use the "Adler"-replica as an instrument of propaganda for the ""new era"" in the city of the Reichsparteitag Nuremberg. They planned to contrast the "Adler" with modern gigantic steam locomotives like the high-speed DRG Class 05. For the realisation of the replica they used the results of the planning in 1925. Besides of different technical data the replica differed from the original with thicker boiler casing and additional cross bracings and spokes wheels made of steel.
