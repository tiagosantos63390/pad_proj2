A developmental SOW—called at the time the MIWS for Multipurpose Individual Weapon System—is preserved among many other one-of-a-kind artifacts in the Naval Historical Center’s collection. The chunky and stubby slab-sided aluminum and steel first-generation prototype is fed from the top using one of the multi-round box mags Childers developed for the 870 shotgun. This one is apparently intended for hip fire only, featuring two pistol grips with heavily worn and deeply scratched olive drab paint giving much evidence of rough use during testing.

In 2013, a video was leaked of Cal Wenzel the CEO and founder of Shane Homes speaking to panel of Calgarian home builders about a plan to influence the decisions of the city council after the upcoming elections. In the video Wenzel spoke of plans to raise $1.1 million to enlist the support of Preston Manning's conservative foundation the Manning Centre for Building Democracy. According to the speech, former Mayor Dave Bronconnier counselled Wenzel on how to control council motions with eight votes. “So for whatever and however, we have to ensure that we end up with the eight votes.” Wenzel proposed as a solution to circumvent direct confrontation with Nenshi's popularity. Wenzel named councillors the industry could rely on to support motions in favor of the lobby and he supported with donations. Nenshi has ordered a probe into what he described as distasteful and shadowy possible violations of electoral laws. In the wake of the release of this video, and violations of campaign fund limits set at $5,000, the Manning Centre has come under scrutiny.
