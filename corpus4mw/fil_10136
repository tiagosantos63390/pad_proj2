Users can download songs for local playback, but due to Digital rights management, they will not remain playable after expiration of the subscription. The service uses a personalization system combining recommendations based on listening habits and algorithms with human curation and playlists from music professionals, including other "guest" curators, such as "Rolling Stone", "Rap Radar", and "Pitchfork". Song searches prioritize the original, master recordings of songs over other versions (such as covers).
