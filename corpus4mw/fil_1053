The service is operated with a fleet of four four-wheel electric railcars, built in Rastatt between 1955 and 1960, plus a fifth identical railcar built by the railway itself in 1979. Although double-ended, the railcars are unusual in that they have doors only on one side, as all platforms are on the same side of the track. They can operate either singly or in pairs.

Unfortunately, Mindworm's impressionability and loneliness were later exploited by criminals who used him to assist in a robbery and he was again imprisoned. This time, while in prison, Mindworm began to exhibit signs of extreme mental illness. When he was released, he could not work or sustain himself and became homeless. He was preyed upon by local hoodlums and not wanting to use his powers to injure others he would not defend himself. Spider-Man noticed Mind-Worm's plight but was unsure how to help him. Before Spider-Man could act, Mindworm was killed by a street gang.

After 50 years, the theatre's 800 seats were deemed insufficient for productions of the day, and it was demolished. On 17 June 1937, Gracie Fields sang to the workmen as she laid the foundation stone of the new Art Deco-decorated theatre, designed by Robert Cromie, and the theatre opened on 27 October that year. The new theatre's seating capacity was about 1,100, and it had a larger stage and improved facilities for both the artists and the public, including a large, stylish stalls bar (the bar itself was 14 metres long), complete with dance floor. The first productions at the new theatre were "Les Folies de Paris et Londres", starring George Robey, followed by "Folies De Can-Can" in 1938, a continuation of the old theatre's series of successful risqué revues, which ran continuously until 2am every night. The musical comedy, "Present Arms", was offered in 1940, and in 1941 the theatre screened the UK premiere of Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator". The film had been banned in many parts of Europe, and the theatre's owner, Alfred Esdaile, was fined for showing it.
