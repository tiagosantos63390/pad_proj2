Even though the Los Angeles area currently lacks an NFL franchise, Goodell said in 2009 that the game could be held there to mark the fiftieth Super Bowl and to commemorate Super Bowl I, which was held at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. At the time of Goodell's comment, there were proposals to build two stadiums that could have hosted the game: Farmers Field in Downtown Los Angeles (L.A. Live) and Los Angeles Stadium in City of Industry, California. However, neither was scheduled for construction by the time the league announced the finalists for host city. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the aforementioned L.A. Coliseum were also discussed as possible host stadiums in the area. The Rose Bowl, despite never having hosted an NFL team, hosted the Super Bowl five times between 1977 and 1993. The NFL has not had a franchise in the city since the 1994 season and has not had a Super Bowl played in the metropolitan area since 1993.
