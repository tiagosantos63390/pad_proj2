San Luca was founded on October 18, 1592, by the Prince Sigismund Loffredo and named after the saint of that particular day, Luke the Evangelist, who became the patron saint of the town.

McPherson's height (6 ft 3) ensured he was a commanding presence defensively, as well as a potent attacking weapon, both as a goalscoring threat and a targetman for flick-ons. Despite his stature he was also quite an adept dribbler, and his sporadic runs from defence were renowned, particularly when playing as part of a three-man central defence with Hearts. This ability also led to him sometimes being deployed at right-back, as opposed to his usual role as a central defender. These runs were used to devastating effect in big matches, such as the 3-1 victory over Celtic in November 1991, and the classic 4-2 victory over Rangers during the Scottish Cup tie at Tynecastle in February 1995.
