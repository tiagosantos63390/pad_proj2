Order: Chiroptera
The first match that aired in the event was a Money in the Bank Ladder Match for a World Heavyweight Championship Contract. This featured Damien Sandow, Tensai, Christian, Santino Marella, Tyson Kidd, Dolph Ziggler, Cody Rhodes and Sin Cara. Santino appeared to have a chance to win the match after giving Ziggler the Cobra but his fear of heights caused a delay which cost him a shot at retrieving the case. Cody then appeared ready to retrieve the case but he was distracted by Vickie Guerrero and that allowed Dolph to hit him with the Zig Zag. Kidd then pulled off the move of the match by knocking Dolph off the ladder with the aid of another ladder and a high-flying move. The action even took place outside of the ring as Tensai set up a ladder outside of the ring across the ring apron and power bombed Sin Cara on it. Christian appeared to be ready to retrieve the case when Ziggler used the ladder Tensai set up as a bridge back into the ring, knocked Christian off of the ladder and then grabbed the suit case.
