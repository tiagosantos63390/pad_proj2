The Avatar is the player's character. This unit's default name is Robin, in Japan, but the player is able to edit the Avatar's name however they wish. They can also edit the Avatar's Asset and Flaw stats, which will impact his/her maximum stats and growth rates with each individual stat (for example, having a Magic asset will cause the Avatar's magic stat to grow faster). The Avatar's gender has little impact on the story, but different support conversations can be presented to the player: an example is Lon'qu, who is shy around women: a female Avatar will be forced to pelt him with figs in order to train with him, but a male Avatar would have no such problems. As far as personality is concerned, no matter the individual appearance of the Avatar, he/she is portrayed as a friendly, likeable person who nonetheless has a real gift for battle strategy. He/she also has a severe case of amnesia: he/she is unable to recall the past with any clarity.
