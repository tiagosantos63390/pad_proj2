In an interview, Boer stated that he came up with the typeface after a hard final he was studying for. Its creation was an attempt to keep the characters from appearing to spin around, a symptom often reported in dyslexics. Boer related this to the way most people think in words: dyslexics cannot stop seeing letters differently just as non-dyslexic people cannot stop thinking in words.

Isaac and Carver can now roll and take cover to avoid attacks. This new ability was described by a Visceral Games developer as essential, as it "felt dumb/terrible not to have it" and that they have been "making Isaac more responsive", as they "want the horror to come from the terrible things that happen in the game; not from the horror that something is moving slowly towards you and you can't shoot it because the game controls like a piece of crap." The cover system is also described as "organic" in nature; for example, the player does not need to "walk up to certain tagged things and press the cover button; Clarke or Carver just does the action that is appropriate for the given situation."

The Griffins call the FBI to hopefully get Meg back, but the FBI said that a person must be missing for 96 hours before they could take action. Concerned by it, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves to take matters into their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave to get in, and Stewie is sold to Brian. However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab king waiting in the master stateroom. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a "goddess" and asks her to marry him, to which Meg eagerly agrees. Stewie then kills the prince, uses a neuralizer on Meg, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely.
Academic Bruno Starrs makes the argument that the film's Aboriginal protagonists undergo a journey in which they learn the importance of choosing the protest songs of black Soul over the white coloniser's "whining" Country and Western songs. Their song choices are an assertion of Indigenous sovereignty and Starrs argues that the Aboriginal Australian 'Welcome to Country' is twice subverted to reinforce this theme, firstly in the Cummeragunja pub and secondly in war-torn Vietnam.

"The Boston Strangler", also from 1968 (dir. Richard Fleischer), has several long multi-frame sequences clearly based on Chapman's original in terms of arrangement and rhythm; here, however, the panes remain static and do not show identical images in simultaneous multiplicity. Fleischer used the technique again, this time with subdivided images and moving panes closer to Chapman's original, in the title sequence to his 1973 film "Soylent Green".
