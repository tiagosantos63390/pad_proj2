In the third stage, the cyclists were reserving energy for the fourth stage, in which the first mountain would show up. The riders started without Belgian cyclist Gaston Rebry; he had finished in the second stage outside of the time limit, together with Spaniard Luciano Montero, and although the tour direction allowed them to start again in the third stage, Rebry did not take that chance. The peloton kept together for a long time, and started to race only after they had passed Longuyon. The Belgian Frans Dictus tried to escape, but the French cyclists Louviot and Lapebie reeled him back in. Romain Maes tried to get away a few times, but finally a group of fifteen cyclists was formed, who arrived in Metz first, followed by the other important cyclists in less than one minute. The sprint was won by Lapébie. After the stage, the Belgian Romain Maes, who finished in second place, complained about the other Belgian cyclists, saying that they were more concerned about their own standings than about their team mates, and that they did not race as a team.

The Ipswich wet dock was dug in 1842 to accommodate booming commercial coastal trade. The first railway station opened in Ipswich in 1846 providing services to Colchester and London using the Great Eastern Main Line and to Bury St Edmunds using the Ipswich to Ely Line. Services to Norwich started in 1849, to Cambridge in 1851 and in 1859 the East Suffolk Line provided services as far as Great Yarmouth. The station moved to its current location in 1860. The Highway Act 1835 had introduced legislation placed the responsibility of maintenance of roads with the parish surveyor (and also introduced a number of 'rules of the road' such as riding on the left). The Ipswich to South Town and Bungay Turnpike trust was wound up in 1872 following the arrival of the railway. The new county councils took over responsibility for roads and bridges in 1889 following the Local Government Act 1888.

Honest services fraud is generally more easily proven in the public sphere than in the private, because honest services fraud by public officials can include most unethical conduct, whereas honest services fraud by private individuals only includes some unethical conduct. Federal courts have generally recognized two main areas of public-sector honest service fraud: bribery (direct or indirect), where a public official was paid in some way for a particular decision or action, and failure to disclose a conflict of interest, resulting in personal gain.

A few cases of burns on tattoos caused by MRI scans have been documented. Problems tend to occur with designs containing large areas of black ink, since black commonly contains iron oxide; the MRI scanner causes the iron to heat up either by inducing an electrical current or hysteresis. Burning can occur on smaller tattoos such as "permanent makeup", but this is rare. Non-ferrous pigments have also been known to cause burns during an MRI . It should be stressed that tattoo burns are rare, so merely having a tattoo should not be a cause to not get an MRI scan if necessary.

The Liberal Party announced they would provide a one-time increase to public sector pensioners of 2.5%, as well as provide annual increases equivalent to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up to 2%. While Aylward has said increasing payments would cost $13 million in the first year and about $10 million extra for each additional year, the Department of Finance stated that the plan would add $1.2 billion in additional liabilities to the pension plan. Dunderdale slammed the Liberal Party's plan calling it 'foolhardy'.
