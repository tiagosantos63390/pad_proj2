History.
2009 Rossi 6, Lorenzo 4
In 1995,(immediately after signing Nuclear Convention 1994) The Atomic Energy Agency (PAEC) had itself established the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Board (PNRB) within PAEC. PNRB was established to oversee the regulatory affairs. Complete separation of promotion and regulatory functions and responsibilities was achieved in 2001, when the President of Pakistan promulgated the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority Ordinance No.III of 2001. Consequently, Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) was created, dissolving the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Board and Directorate of Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection. The first chairman of PNRA was Jamshed Azim Hashmi who headed the authority till 2009. In 2009, the chairmanship was transferred to Anwar Habib.
