He made his debut for Arsenal against Newcastle United on 13 August 1919 (which was Arsenal's first-ever top flight game at Highbury).

Eventually, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet plans to extend the US 60 By-Pass (also known as the Wendell H. Ford Expressway) eastward from just north of the Kentucky Route 54 interchange to the junction of U.S. 60/231 and Kentucky Route 2830 between Owensboro and Maceo, Kentucky. This project, in tandem with the Natcher Bridge and Indiana's expansion of U.S. 231 to four lanes from the Ohio River to Interstate 64, will create an almost non-stop, high-speed route from I-64 near Dale, Indiana to Interstate 65 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, allowing a bypass of Louisville, Kentucky.
