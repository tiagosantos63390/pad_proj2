In the second half of the 20th century, Cincinnati, along with other rust belt cities, underwent a vast demographic transformation. Predominantly white, working-class families that had filled the urban core during the European immigration boom in the 19th century moved to the suburbs. Blacks, fleeing the oppression of the Jim Crow South in hopes of better socioeconomic opportunity, filled these older city neighborhoods. Racial tensions boiled over in 1968 with the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. when riots occurred in Cincinnati along with nearly every major U.S. city. In April 2001, racially charged riots occurred after police shot and killed a black man, Timothy Thomas during a foot pursuit.

Diana () is an almost abandoned settlement located in the forests south-east of Rozvadov municipality, Tachov District, Czech Republic. The population is around 30 people. The area of Diana, today a part of Rozvadov, consists also of a former glasshouse and a large defunct woodworking factory. A hunting mansion Diana (first mentioned in 1742) is situated in the settlement. The mansion, which was in the past owned by the Kolowrat noble family, was named after the goddess of hunting. Its project is sometimes attributed to the Czech-Italian architect Jan Santini Aichel. The adjacent natural reserve Diana (since 1933) consists of one of the oldest and most valuable beech tree forests in the Upper Palatine Forest. 
"Skiensposten" was started in 1842 by Herman Bagger, a Danish immigrant who had worked as a jurist, teacher, farmer and politician. Before the end of the year, however, he grew tired and resigned as chief editor. "Skiensposten" survived for the time being, but faced competition from "Bratsberg Amtstidende", a newspaper founded in 1840 by Peter Feilberg. The new owners of "Skiensposten" tried to halve the price, and changed its name to "Skiens Adressetidende". However, this was not enough to keep it in circulation, and it went defunct near the end of 1843.
