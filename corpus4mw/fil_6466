Bleckwenn published his findings on this topic in 1930, in landmark papers in the "Wisconsin Medical Journal;" the "Journal of the American Medical Association" (JAMA), and "Archives of Neurology & Psychiatry," In the JAMA paper, he stated that ""the catatonic patient has shown some extremely interesting and striking responses" intravenous amytal. "Periods of from four to fourteen hours of a normal lucid interval have been a constant result of the treatment."" Bleckwenn was forward-thinking regarding the documentation of these effects, making motion pictures of the process. Of those, Fink says ""His silent films show the patients as mute, posturing, rigid, with heads raised fixedly from the pillow, and then responding dramatically to multigram doses of amobarbital. The films were convincing, and amobarbital was quickly and widely used to obtain clinical histories and to allow feeding and self-care."" Psychiatrists across the world became enthused by sodium amytal therapy. In his text entitled ""A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry,"" Shorter states that ""Some observers view Bleckwenn's procedure as the real beginning of psychopharmacology.""
