Demographics.
In the 1990s, it became obvious to many in the French film industry that one of the industry's biggest problems was the lack of qualified screenwriters so in 1993, Swaim joined the Association Équinoxe, a screen writing workshop, founded by Jeanne Moreau. These workshops were designed to give an international profile and resonance to selected French and European projects, allowing them to reach a variety of audiences in a more direct way. Since 1993, there have been almost 8000 screenplays submitted and over 200 writers selected, 135 international advisers, and a record 65 films produced and released. In 2003, Swaim was elected to the Board of Directors of Équinoxe.

Smith's father was a younger brother of Joseph Smith, Sr., making him a first cousin of Joseph Smith Jr. Silas was converted when Joseph Sr. visited him in 1830, but was not baptized into the church until 1835 by his nephew Hyrum Smith. Smith's mother, Mary, would join the church a couple of years later. Jesse was an infant when his parents joined the church and a young boy when his father died of illness. Smith and his brother were considered well educated, for the time, by their mother since she had taught school.

Specially noteworthy among his metrical translations from the Hungarian are the "Magyarische Gedichte" (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1825); and "Himfys auserlesene Liebeslieder" (Pest, 1829; 2nd ed., 1831). A valuable contribution to folk-lore appeared in the "Magyarische Sagen, Marchen und Erzahlungen" (Brünn, 1825; 2nd ed., Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1837, 2, vols).
Explanation.

Education.
Solomon Quetsch was an Austrian rabbi and Talmudist. He was born at Nikolsburg, Moravia on October 13, 1798, and died there January 30, 1856. He was educated at the yeshiva of his native city under Mordechai Benet, and was his premier disciple. He officiated as rabbi successively at Piesling, Leipnik, and Nikolsburg. In the later city, where he succeeded Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, he officiated for only a few months. He was a traditionalist, but was distinguished by a tolerant and kindly disposition. Of his literary works only some Talmudic novellæ are known, edited under the title "Chokmat Shelomoh" in the collection "Harha-Mor" by Moses Löb Kohn (Vienna, 1862).
By the late-1970s, the program adopted the name "The Talk of Gasoline Alley" (in reference to the nickname of the garage area at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway). Davidson was often invited to broadcast the program from one of the garages, and mechanics were usually heard in the background working on the cars. In many years, the show was done from the garages of the Jonathan Byrd team.
From then on, nothing Democrats could do would overcome the appearance that they were trying to steal the election on technicalities. And nothing Republicans could say would overcome the suspicion that they had planned the whole thing.
In contemporary society, rural families no longer own land or pass it down to the next generation. They may, however, own and transmit houses. Rural families pay medical expenses and school fees for their children. Under the people's commune system in force from 1958 to 1982, the income of a peasant family depended directly on the number of laborers it contributed to the collective fields. This, combined with concern over the level of support for the aged or disabled provided by the collective unit, encouraged peasants to have many sons. Under the agricultural reforms that began in the late 1970s, households took on an increased and more responsible economic role. The labor of family members is still the primary determinant of income. But rural economic growth and commercialization increasingly have rewarded managerial and technical skills and have made unskilled farm labor less desirable. As long as this economic trend continues in the countryside in the late 1980s, peasant families are likely to opt for fewer but better educated children.
