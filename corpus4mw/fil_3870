In a mansion, possible some time during the Victorian era, Tom is trying to squash Jerry with a heavy ball attached to a rope. The fourth time he swings, Tom hits a loose floorboard and sends Jerry into a clothes drawer. Tom is drawing back for another strike, but Jerry signals for Tom to stop. Tom brakes and catches his ball, but falls to the ground due to its weight. Jerry slaps Tom with a glove and Tom claps his hand to the slapped cheek in shock. Tom hands Jerry his card. After Jerry reads it, he throws it aside and hands Tom his card, thus challenging each other to a duel. After the opening credits, the two are seen walking towards each other, each wearing a top hat and cape, ready for the duel.
