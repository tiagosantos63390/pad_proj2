Hammer originally leased country houses in which to shoot films, until the company eventually purchased Down Place on the banks of the Thames near Bray. After using every room and angle in its films, it later enlarged the house into the Bray Studios of today. The last Hammer production made at Bray was "The Mummy's Shroud", which wrapped on 21 October 1966. Hammer sold the studio in November, 1970. Bray Studios continues to host television, film work and band rehearsals today. Bray Studios is now under threat of redevelopment into a residential area under the current owner of the studio who has claimed there is no call for the studio any more, despite having refused a number of applications by productions to use the facilities. A pressure group is currently trying to save the studio.

The Sutros lived for a time in Paris; among the friends they made there was Maurice Maeterlinck, with whom Sutro established a lifelong friendship. Sutro undertook to translate Maeterlinck's works into English, and it was his versions of "The Treasure of the Humble" (1897), "Wisdom and Destiny" (1898) and "The Life of the Bee" (1901) that introduced Maeterlinck to anglophone readers. Sutro's other Maeterlinck translations, some made jointly with his friend Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, include "Aglavaine and Selysette", "Joyzelle", "The Life of the White Ant", "The Buried Temple", "Monna Vanna", "The Death of Tintagiles", and "The Magic of the Stars".

Because requirements evolve over the course of a project, especially a long one, an architect is needed until the system is accepted by the user: the architect insures that all changes and interpretations made during the course of development do not compromise the user's viewpoint.
Some conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Since many laboratory results, at least in Europe and the US, are automatically processed by computerized laboratory information systems, the results are relatively easy to inexpensively collate in special purpose databases or disease registries. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level.

He was on the presenting team of a short-lived early evening news programme "Sixty Minutes" which began in 1983, and was intended as a replacement for "Nationwide", but proved an unwieldy format. In the same period he was a founder presenter of the BBC's "Breakfast Time" on BBC 1, the first regular such programme in this timeslot, from its launch in early 1983, with Frank Bough and Selina Scott, as well as launching "Watchdog" as a prime time stand-alone consumer series.

Eventually "Ras" Haile was able to recruit "Dejazmach" Wolde Gabriel, the son of "Ras" Mikael Sehul to join him, and when it appeared Ali (who had managed by that time to obtain a promotion to "Ras") was preoccupied with the rebellion of his relative Yasufe in Lasta, proclaimed Baeda Maryam emperor. A peace was quickly patched up with Yasufe, and "Ras" Ali then turned his attention to this new threat. On the Thursday before Easter 1788, "Ras" Ali, "Dejazmach" Hailu Eshte, and the Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I met the allied forces of "Ras" Haile Yosadiq, "Dejazmach" Gebre, and Wolde Gabriel in the Battle of Madab. "Ras" Ali defeated this opponents; "Dejazmach" Wolde Gabriel was killed in battle and the pretender Baeda Maryam was captured.

Allantide (, meaning "first day of winter", or Nos Kalan Gwav, meaning "eve of the first day of winter" and Dy' Halan Gwav, meaning "day of the first day of winter") is a Cornish festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31st October, as well as the following day time, and known elsewhere as Hallowe'en. The festival itself seems to have pre-Christian origins similar to most celebrations on this date, however in Cornwall it was popularly linked to St Allen or Arlan a little-known Cornish Saint. Allantide is also known as Allan Night and Allan Day, possibly in reference to the Cornish. The origins of the name Allantide probably stem from the same sources as Hollantide (Wales and the Isle of Man) and Hallowe'en itself. 
Tycho Brahe attempted to directly measure the “bigness” of the stars in terms of angular size, which in theory meant that a star's magnitude could be determined by more than just the subjective judgment described in the above quote. He concluded that first magnitude stars measured 2 arc minutes (2’) in apparent diameter (1/30 of a degree, or 1/15 the diameter of the full moon), with second through sixth magnitude stars measuring 3/2’, 13/12’, 3/4’, 1/2’, and 1/3’, respectively. The development of the telescope showed that these large sizes were illusory—stars appeared much smaller through the telescope. However, early telescopes produced a spurious disk-like image of a star (known today as an Airy disk) that was larger for brighter stars and smaller for fainter one. Astronomers from Galileo to Jaques Cassini mistook these spurious disks for the physical bodies of stars, and thus into the eighteenth century continued to think of magnitude in terms of the physical size of a star. By the time of William Herschel astronomers recognized that the telescopic disks of stars were spurious and a function of the telescope as well as the brightness of the stars, but still spoke in terms of a star's size more than its brightness.

This car made its debut in 2003 at the Tropicana Twister 300 as the #82 Jani-King Chevrolet driven by Casey Atwood, who finished 21st. Randy LaJoie drove the car again at Phoenix, finishing 14th. LaJoie continued to run the car part-time in 2004 with sponsorship from Goulds Pumps, his best finish being 13th at Las Vegas. In 2005, the team switched to #40 with sponsorship from Jani-King and Cottman Transmission. Sterling Marlin began the season with the team, with Carlos Contreras and Scott Lagasse Jr. filling in. Towards the end of the season, Contreras, Paul Wolfe, and Erin Crocker got majority of the starts in the car. Reed Sorenson ran the Aaron's 312 at Atlanta in March in the car after the transmission on his regular #41 Discount Tire car mysteriously locked up during qualifying for the race.

"The Way You Make Me Feel" was recorded by Michael Jackson in 1987 for his seventh studio album "Bad", which was released the same year it was recorded. Epic Records released the song as the third single from the album in November that year. "The Way You Make Me Feel" was written and co-produced by Jackson, and produced by Quincy Jones. Before the recording of "Bad", Jackson had written over sixty songs for the album, with plans of releasing a three disc album, but after Jones convinced Jackson to make "Bad" a one disc LP, "The Way You Make Me Feel", as well as ten other songs were selected for the album. According to Bad 25, a documentary about the 25th anniversary of Bad's release, the song and subsequent video was intended to show another aspect to public's perception of Michael Jackson in addition to his reputation as a lover (I Just Can't Stop Loving You) and being streetwise (Bad) they wanted to show him as a flirt or able to pick up girls.
