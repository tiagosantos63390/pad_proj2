Plot.
At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock (Eddie Cibrian), and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian. This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton (Dante Basco and Kip Pardue), making out. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

Early life and education.

Neurosis is a post-metal band, based in Oakland, California. They formed in 1985 as a hardcore punk band, and their sound progressed towards a doom metal style that also included influences from dark ambient and industrial music as well as incorporating elements of folk music. "Terrorizer Magazine" described Neurosis as "arguably the most influential band of the past two decades."

1924.
Each team must have eight players in the scrum, unless for some reason (i.e. a sending-off or injury) they cannot field 15 players. Specialised front-row players (i.e. props and hookers) must be part of the scrum, for safety reasons under the law. If a specialised player is not available, the scrum must have 'no weight', which means no player is allowed to push forward once the scrum commences. In cases where a front-row player is off the field due to a yellow card (compulsory 10 minutes off the field) or a red card (no longer allowed to participate in the game), a temporary substitution of another player is mandatory to ensure specialist front-row players participate in the scrum. If a team cannot field eight in the scrum, generally it drops the flankers or the number eight, but the props, hooker and locks must be maintained.
