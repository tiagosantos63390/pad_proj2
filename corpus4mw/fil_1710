The third phase is Park Village, a large estate built on the line of the dual carriageway section of the A339, extending up to the edge of the old Park Prewett Hospital. The current development is known as Limes Park and is a huge area of development encompassing new build and the redevelopment of the Park Prewett Hospital buildings.
