James Burke's authority as the Company's engineer seems to have been in question, for on 19 November 1859 a "joint engineer" was appointed: James Samuel, formerly Resident Engineer for the Eastern Counties Railway was given the job. It is likely that he had been given a particular task, for on 14 December 1859 he reported that he estimated the construction cost of the line to be £32,000; on presenting this information he withdrew from involvement with the scheme.

There are conflicting reports as to what really happened on that day in Diyarbakır Prison. The press accounts have produced scenarios that accord with the government's version of events. Some say that there was an uprising in the prison. Others note that the inmates wanted to visit the women's section of the jail. The delegation concluded ""that the authorities in the government had prior knowledge of this incident and in fact some of them took part in its implementation"."

In 1815, back in Copenhagen, the opportunity to join the Russian expedition on the circumnavigational expeditionary ship "Rurik" commanded by Otto von Kotzebue. The other naturalists in the crew were the poet and botanist Adelbert von Chamisso and the physician and zoologist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz. For some reason, he and captain Kotzebue fell out and Wormskjold left the expedition in Petropavlovsk on Kamchatka in 1816. He remained there for the next two years, collecting many specimens, and left in 1818. However, due to misfortune in 1842 – a devastating fire – almost all specimens still in his own possession, together with valuable journals and notes, were destroyed. Some specimens are preserved at the Botanical Museum and Library in Copenhagen and University of Oslo.

Though Ballanta’s observations were not always accurate, his approach to African music was more theoretical and systematic than that of most writers of his time, for he believed his mission was to undertake "scientific studies of the musical conceptions" of African peoples and "to compare them with those of the West." His significance in the history of musical scholarship in Africa therefore lies in (1) his emphasis on extensive fieldwork; (2) his theoretical and descriptive approach to African music; and (3) his regional and comparative approach to African music (now favored by many African musicians).
