Mauduit is best remembered for his popular political pamphlet "Considerations on the Present German War". The work was an attack on British continental involvement which included the presence of British troops in the army of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and the annual subsidies paid to Britain's German allies during the Seven Years' War. The work was first published in November 1760, and went through five editions. The pamphlet was released amidst rising opposition to Britain's involvement in the German War.
Wahl's activities as a civil rights attorney were broader than his work with Milk. In 1971, Wahl obtained a landmark ruling from the United States Supreme Court, requiring prisons to provide prisoners with legal research materials for use in Habeas Corpus petitions and appeals. He also established a federal constitutional right for prisoners to have access to clergy of their choice, even when the correctional authority disapproved of the message of the church at issue.
