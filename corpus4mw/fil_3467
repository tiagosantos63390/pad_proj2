Around 1971, the first calculator and clock chips began to show that very small computers might be possible. The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed in 1971 for a calculator company (Busicom), and produced by Intel. In 1972, Intel introduced a microprocessor having a different architecture: the 8008. The 8008 is the direct ancestor of the current Core i7, even now maintaining code compatibility (every instruction of the 8008's instruction set has a direct equivalent in the Intel Core i7's much larger instruction set, although the opcode values are different).

A few metres from the platform, the track carrying lines S 3, S 4, S 6 and S 8 branches to the right away from the track carrying lines S 1 and S 2 and then crosses over it on a flyover. The nearest stations in this direction are Pasing, Obermenzing and Moosach. It is possible to transfer to regional and long-distance services in Pasing. Platform track 2 is used by S-Bahn trains heading into city on lines S1 and S2. Platform track 3 is used by S-Bahn services heading into city from Pasing. The next stop into the city is Hirschgarten.
