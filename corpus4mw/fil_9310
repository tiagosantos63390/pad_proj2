Chennai is the earliest hub of the Korean community in India, owing to Hyundai's decision to open factories in the city in 1995. Koreans concentrated largely in the Kilpauk township, which has acquired the nickname of "Little Korea" as a result. The Korean community in the city continued to grow in the following years, and by 2009, there were about 3,000 Koreans in the city, up from about 700 in 2006. Since then, Koreans make up the largest number of expatriates in Chennai. As of 2013, there are over 4,000 Koreans in the city. According to the Korea Trade Centre, the city has over 150 Korean companies, including Hyundai Motors, Samsung, LG, and Lotte. Several small and medium enterprises, mainly automobile spare parts, logistics and engineering companies, such as Hwashin, Dong-Sung and Doowon, have their operations to support these large firms.

Lyrically, it speaks about a love stronger than a gunshot, and according to Stacy-Ann Ellis of "Vibe" magazine it is a "less violent version" of Rihanna's 2011 single "Man Down". "Edmonton Journal" Sandra Sperounes wrote that on "No Love Allowed" Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on the same way she did on her 2005 debut single "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of "Billboard", Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, can be heard in the lines, "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let get the best of me." BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony.

Seeing all the singers, you really come face to face with a lot of people that are predominantly younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.
