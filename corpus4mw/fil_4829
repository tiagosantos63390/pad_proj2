Originally formed in the early 80s, the Los Angeles band Windows delivered 11 albums over the course of a dozen years. Guided by bassist/vocalist Skipper Wise and his writing partner keyboardist Ed Cohen, the group was a hybrid sound, and plumbed various forms of fusion while simultaneously examining avenues with more polish and sheen. Peter White performed regularly on many Windows albums appearing as a more or less 'permanent guest', while, in turn, Wise helped launch White's solo career producing his first two releases. Although Windows' fortunes culminated with the 1989 number one radio album “The French Laundry”, some of the finest fruits of Wise's and Cohen's creativity ripened afterward, the 1990 follow up Blue September being among those most particularly noteworthy.
