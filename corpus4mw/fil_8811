The Constant Pressure System was used for the first time when Larami Toys released the Super Soaker CPS 2000 in 1996. To this day, the CPS 2000 is the most powerful production water gun, with an output of 30 oz. per second, and a range of 53 feet. After the CPS 2000, Larami released several CPS models from 1996 to 2002. These are the CPS 2000 (1996), CPS 1000, CPS 1500, CPS 2500, and CPS 3000 (1998), the CPS 1200, CPS 1700, CPS 2700, and CPS 3200 (2000) the CPS 1-3-5, and CPS Splashzooka (2001), the CPS 2100, and CPS 4100 (2002).

Professional career.
Captain Jon R. Fahs Jr, raised in Tallahassee, Florida, graduated with honors from Duke University in 1986 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science. He earned a Master's Degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in Mechanical Engineering. Following initial nuclear power and submarine training, he served as Division Officer on USS Batfish (SSN-681), which was undergoing Refueling Overhaul in Charleston, South Carolina. He qualified in submarines and completed a Mediterranean Deployment on USS Narwhal (SSN-671).
In 1714, the land on which "Clover Forest" stands was first part of the several thousands of acres patented by Charles Fleming which would eventually become the neighboring plantations of "Rock Castle", "Snowden", "Howard’s Neck" and the site of "Elk Island". It was more land than one man could seat (settle) and portions fell back to the Crown of England. In 1739/1740 Lieutenant Governor William Gooch authorized the sale of 2,590 acres for 13 pounds to John Woodson, Gentleman. John Woodson split the purchase with Joseph Dabbs, but Woodson and Dabbs failed “to make such cultivation and improvements” to the land as required and the land reverted to the crown. In 1745, the land was sold again for 13 pounds to Philip Webber. Philip Webber likewise could not fulfill his obligations and again the land reverted and resold, this time for 11 pounds 15 shillings, to Arthur Hopkins in 1753. Hopkins apparently did better than his predecessors: under his ownership only a portion reverted to the Crown.
