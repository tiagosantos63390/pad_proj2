Although Platner identified the Clivus Argentarius ("Banker Street") with the Lautumiae, Lawrence Richardson distinguishes the two in "A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome" (1992). Richardson identified the Clivus Argentarius as the street that connects the Roman Forum and the Campus Martius, running from the Vulcanal and along the front of the Carcer (Tullianum) over the northeast slope of the Capitoline Hill. Only medieval sources name a "Clivus Argentarius," but it probably reflects the ancient financial activity centered on the offices of "argentarii", professional deposit bankers.
