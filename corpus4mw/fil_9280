She plays classical piano and speaks Polish, French and English. Since switching to a serious pursuit of a film career in 2001, Wolski has guest starred on almost every series on the West Coast Vancouver film scene including "Under the Cover" which she wrote and starred in. Wolski travelled to Mozambique by invitation of director Ed Zwick to visit the set of "Blood Diamond": she was also a guest at the Los Angeles premiere in December. Wolski actively supports actors working for social and environmental change: she is a member of Hollywood Hill, drives a VW Beetle and hopes to help promote clean diamonds as an alternative for her fellow actresses for glamorous events. She is also a big fan of animal & dog causes - her childhood "brother" was a large German Shepherd/Wolf cross called "Nero".
