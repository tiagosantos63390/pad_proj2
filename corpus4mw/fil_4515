The second anime adaptation entitled "Ef: A Tale of Melodies." is produced by the same staff as with the first series, and contains the same cast of voice actors. "Ef: A Tale of Melodies" began airing in Japan on October 7, 2008 on TV Kanagawa. Very much like the first season, the first letter in each episode's title reveals a hidden meaning. The first six episodes spell out the word "future" backwards with the following six episodes having the prefix "re-" attached to five of the first six episode titles, but introduced in reverse. For example, episode six is entitled "flection" and episode seven is titled "reflection". For episode twelve, the title is "forever".
