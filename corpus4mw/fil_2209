Gigi Cestone, capo of the Aprile crew, meets with Tony and explains to him how Ralphie's driving ambition to unseat him combined with the stresses of closing a contract and putting two kids through school is bothering him, but that he will not let this affect his production. Silvio Dante comments to Tony that the weight of Gigi's responsibilities are driving him to an early grave and Junior Soprano tells him that, while Gigi is strong and capable, he is not fully respected by his crew, especially with an ambitious Ralph making trouble; therefore he will constantly be undermined by them. Tony laments that despite this he cannot replace Gigi without looking indecisive and weak; notwithstanding that, there are no suitable candidates. Junior tell him that such predicaments are just part of the job of being boss. Gigi, despite having problems with his bowels, enjoys turkey sandwiches at his business hangout with his crew, appreciating Ralphie's absence. Later that day, Gigi is found dead on the toilet of a heart attack. Tony is consequently pressed into the decision who to elevate to captain of the crew.

It was extended to Aguas Calientes () in 1928, passing to government control in 1931. Although further extended in stages through to Quillabamba (reached in 1978), landslides (attributed to effects of El Niño) caused it to be abandoned beyond Hidroelectrica in 1998. It is now also operated by PeruRail and forms the only means of access for visitors to Machu Picchu. At the beginning of 2010 it was cut by landslides.
