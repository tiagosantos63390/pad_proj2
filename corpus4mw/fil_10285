Summary.
If a player has a natural pair showing (for example they have two Jacks face up, a pair made including the face down card does not count) the next card they are dealt becomes a wild card. So for example if the player needs a 6 to make three-of-a-kind, the next card out would count as a 6 no matter what its actual value.
A Microsoft Excel add-in is used for communication between the Jedox OLAP database and the Excel front-end. Users can link any number of Excel workspaces on-line, all of which access one central data stock (single point of truth). The data entered in Microsoft Excel is written back and aggregated to the OLAP cube structure through the add-in. Due to the well-known Excel interface, specialists may use Jedox to create budgets, analyses, and reports without any specialist IT knowledge.
