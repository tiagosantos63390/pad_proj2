McKenna and Bell recognized two subfamilies (Plesiadapinae and Saxonellinae) and one unassigned genus ("Pandemonium") within Plesiadapidae. More recently "Saxonella" (the only saxonelline) and "Pandemonium" have been excluded from the family, leaving only a redundant Plesiadapinae. Within the family, "Pronothodectes" is the likely ancestor of all other genera, while "Plesiadapis" may be directly ancestral to both "Chiromyoides" and "Platychoerops".

Wheelchair racing is the racing of wheelchairs in track and road races. Wheelchair racing is open to athletes with any qualifying type of disability, amputees, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy and partially sighted (when combined with another disability). Athletes are classified in accordance with the nature and severity of their disability or combinations of disabilities. Like running, it can take place on a track or as a road race. The main competitions take place at the Summer Paralympics which wheelchair racing and athletics has been a part of since 1960. Competitors compete in specialized wheelchairs which allow the athletes to reach speeds of 30Â km/h or more. It is one of the most prominent forms of Paralympic athletics.
