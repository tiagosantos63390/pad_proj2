There are three basic plans with varying levels of coverage available for Washington residents: Bronze (60 percent), Silver (70 percent) and Gold (80 percent). Plans with a lower percentage have lower premiums, and higher costs to the individuals (out-of-pocket costs, deductibles and co-payments). A catastrophic plan is available and designed for younger individuals (under the age of 30) and these plans will have a high deductible and a lower premium.
