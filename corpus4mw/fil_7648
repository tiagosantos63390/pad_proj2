Blackmon received an athletic scholarship to attend Oklahoma State University, where he played for coach Mike Gundy's Oklahoma State Cowboys football team from 2008 to 2011. He was redshirted as a true freshman in 2008, but quickly earned a starting position in 2009. He was named the 2010 Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, the first receiver to earn the honor. He was awarded the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top receiver, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. Blackmon also holds the NCAA records for most consecutive games gaining 100 yards or more and most games gaining 200 yards or more. Statistically, Blackmon caught 102 passes for 1,665 yards and 18 touchdowns in 11 games during the 2010 regular season and also added a pair of scores with a 69-yard run and a blocked punt return. This performance earned him the 15th-best season in NCAA history.
