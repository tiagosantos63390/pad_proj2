In the United States Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) is a method for funding construction or renovations on federal property by allowing a private developer to lease underutilized property, with rent paid by the developer in the form of cash or in-kind services. Currently, EULs are used by the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration. Temporary authority has also been granted to the General Services Agency and the National Aeronatics and Space Administration. EUL authority is derived from Congress and is specific to each agency (e.g. 10 USC 2667 for the DoD). The information below is specific to DoD EULs.
Following the 2005 election, there was constant speculation over the date of Blair's departure. At Westminster, he was expected to retire after the proposed UK referendum on the European Union Constitution, but the constitution being thwarted at referendum in other countries negated any need for one in the UK (such a major issue as a union-wide constitution would require unanimity amongst the EU's member states). The July 2005 terror attacks also reduced the likelihood of an early departure. Speculation as to the likely timing of Blair's departure increased in May 2006, following Labour's poor results in English local elections.

In 1653, he married Hon. Sarah Moore, second daughter of Charles Moore, 2nd Viscount Moore and had by her four sons and three daughters. She was the sister-of-law to Caulfeild's younger brother Thomas. Caulfeild died in April 1671 and was buried at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh on 25 May. His wife survived him until 1712. He was succeeded in his titles by his second and oldest surviving son William. His daughter Mary was the second wife of William Blayney, 6th Baron Blayney and his daughter Alice married firstly John, son of James Margetson and secondly George Carpenter, 1st Baron Carpenter. Caulfeild's youngest son John sat in the Parliament of Ireland.

A first ChIP-on-chip experiment was performed in 1999 to analyze the distribution of cohesin along budding yeast chromosome III. Although the genome was not completely represented, the protocol in this study remains equivalent as those used in later studies. The ChIP-on-chip technique using all of the ORFs of the genome (that nevertheless remains incomplete, missing intergenic regions) was then applied successfully in three papers published in 2000 and 2001. The authors identified binding sites for individual transcription factors in the budding yeast "Saccharomyces cerevisiae". In 2002, Richard Young’s group determined the genome-wide positions of 106 transcription factors using a c-Myc tagging system in yeast. This study was followed by a collaboration with the laboratory of Brian Dynlacht which reported the first ChIP-on-chip study in mammalian cells Other applications for ChIP-on-chip include DNA replication, recombination, and chromatin structure. Since then, ChIP-on-chip has become a powerful tool in determining genome-wide maps of histone modifications and many more transcription factors. ChIP-on-chip in mammalian systems has been difficult due to the large and repetitive genomes. Thus, many studies in mammalian cells have focused on select promoter regions that are predicted to bind transcription factors and have not analyzed the entire genome. However, whole mammalian genome arrays have recently become commercially available from companies like Nimblegen. In the future, as ChIP-on-chip arrays become more and more advanced, high resolution whole genome maps of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin components for mammals will be analyzed in more detail.

"Can't You See" is a 1994 song by Brookdale R&B girl group Total, released as their debut single. The track was released from the "New Jersey Drive Soundtrack" and also later appeared on the soundtrack to "The Wackness", and their debut album. After making their recording debut on his tracks "Juicy", "One More Chance" and "One More Chance" (Hip Hop Remix)", The Notorious B.I.G. returned the favour with an intro rap verse to the song. The track was written and arranged by Terri & Monica's Terri Robinson, produced entirely by Sean "Puffy" Combs with instrumentation provided by associates Rashad Smith, Herb Middleton and Chucky Thompson and contains a sample from James Brown's "The Payback". The track was a success both on the mainstream US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, reaching number thirteen and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it made number three. The song also peaked at number forty-three on the UK Singles Chart, where it charted for two weeks.

Under the commonly used geographic definition, the border between Asia and Europe stretches along the Ural Mountains, Ural River, and Caspian Sea in the east, the Greater Caucasus range and the Black Sea, with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles, in the south. Based on that division, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey have territory both in Europe and Asia.

The path starts in the north, at the northeast corner of Yallambie Road and Greensborough Highway. Heading south it passes by the west side of the Simpson Army Barracks in Watsonia, crosses Lower Plenty Road and then crosses Banyule Road and heads downhill past a stand of river red gums, crosses Buckingham Stree and continues past Banyule Theatre (Viewbank College). Further along it passes Warringal Park on its west side and then intersects the Yarra River Trail.
