At some point after the trial, but before the special verdict was copied for the London review, Huddleston realised that he had made a potentially fatal error. In his original draft, he had described the "Mignonette" as an "English Merchant vessel" but had altered this to read "yacht". Further, he had described the lifeboat as "an open boat" and not asserted its provenance on the "Mignonette". He now realised that he had omitted the critical finding necessary to give the court jurisdiction over Dudley and Stephens. Huddleston's solution was simply to alter his record of the verdict.

The winter/arctic pattern was introduced as an upgrade to the current monochrome winter whites to further enhance the Canadian soldier's camouflage capability by day and night. It includes near infra-red (NIR) technology.
In a god-forsaken, off-season French seaside town we meet "Mellie" (Marlène Jobert), who watches a mysterious stranger step down from the bus into the pouring rain. He follows and eventually rapes her, while her husband (an airline navigator) is away from home. However, when she comes to her senses again, she manages to kill her attacker and dispose of the corpse. She decides to keep quiet about the whole incident to avoid complications with her jealous husband. But just then the tough US Army colonel Harry Dobbs (Charles Bronson) appears on the scene. Dobbs is out on undercover work trying to track down a serial rapist who has escaped from a military stockade in Germany. He confronts her, and she is shocked that he seems to know exactly what has happened, but she sticks to her story of knowing nothing. Since the Colonel is less than forthcoming about his own mission, she also starts to worry about her absent husband possibly being implicated in something shady. Then a dead body is discovered on the beach where she dumped the rapist's body – and further complications ensue.

The wooden corvette "Esmeralda" was constructed in 1854 in Henry Pitcher's shipyard, arriving at Valparaíso in 1856. This vessel was named "Esmeralda" after the frigate of the same name captured by Lord Cochrane at El Callao in 1820. The "Esmeralda" displaced 854 tons, and was armed with twenty 32-pounder cannon and two 12-pounder cannon. In 1868, this was replaced with twelve 40-pounder rifled cannon and four 40-pounder Whitworth cannon.
