On September 19, 2002, Bey turned himself in when a warrant was issued for his arrest, charged with 27 counts in the alleged rapes of four girls under the age of 14. The cases were pending trial into the following year. The oldest allegation was that beginning twenty years earlier, he had serially raped through coercion and beatings a preteen girl who, as a ten-year-old, came under foster care of Bey and his wife Nora Bey. In her request for a temporary restraining order one month prior to the arrest, the woman claimed that Bey's wife also knew of the serial rapes, but did nothing. The girl gave birth to a child at age 13 in 1982. Oakland's district attorney's office claimed to have conclusive DNA evidence identifying Bey as the father.
