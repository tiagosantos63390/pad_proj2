As of November 2013, Sydney has 23 buildings under construction and 97 at planning stages. The most recently completed high-rise was 8 Chifley Square, which stands at 140 m (459 ft) when measured to its roof. A recent 235 m (797 ft) height restriction implementation has slowed Sydney’s high-rise developments and its construction boom has been marred significantly by Melbourne’s, which allows for significantly taller structures.
The René Goscinny award, named after the writer of Asterix and Lucky Luke, is awarded to comic writers at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. It was first awarded in 1988 and again every year since 1995. The award is given in order to encourage "young" comic writers, those whose comic careers have only began to flourish. The awardee is chosen by a jury mostly composed of comics specialists: authors, journalists, and Angoulême festival organizers. The winner receives 5000 euro.

The signature of Rowe's written work was his patient explication of the role and impact of each part of a play's structure; his lucidity and insight were evident in his line-by-line analysis of sample plays such as Ibsen's "A Doll's House". The passage of time has done little to diminish the book's value in helping a writer address the enduring practical issues involved in constructing a play. The book was re-published in the United States in 1944 and again in 1968.

The race was halted at 3:05 p.m., and track crews rushed to Savage's aid. Moments later, 22-year-old Armando Teran, a crew member of Graham McRae's car (Savage's teammate at Patrick Racing) was serving as the pit board man, started sprinting up the pit lane towards the crash scene. At the same time, a fire truck was signaled to head to the scene. Cleon Reynolds, the Chief of the Speedway Fire Department, signaled for fire/safety truck driver Jerry Flake to proceed northbound up the pit lane to the crash scene. Flake was stationed at the south end of the pits. Flake, driving northbound, struck Teran and tossed his body about 50 feet. Teran suffered crushed ribs and a broken skull, and was pronounced dead at 4:23 p.m. The incident was witnessed by thousands of spectators, as it occurred on the pit lane right at the start/finish line. It was erroneously reported by media that Flake was driving the wrong way, and was at fault; at the time, safety trucks were permitted to drive in the opposite direction of the racing cars. The following year, USAC prohibited safety trucks from driving in the opposite direction.
