The first permanent Moskvoretsky bridge was built in 1829, about 50 meters west of the present site. Three wooden arches, each 28 meters long, were supported by stone abutments. It was loosely based on Kamennooostrovsky Bridge in Saint Petersburg designed by Agust√≠n de Betancourt. The bridge burnt down in 1871; after the fire, steel arches and decking were installed on the old abutments.
