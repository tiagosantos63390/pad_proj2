Emmitt Douglas
On 30 September 2010, one month before his 20th birthday, he made his debut for the main squad, playing 20 minutes in a 0–2 loss against BSC Young Boys for the season's UEFA Europa League group stage. One months 1/2 later, in a home fixture against the same Swiss opponent – in the same competition – he scored the game's only goal, all this before having appeared in La Liga for the Madrid outskirst team.

The band has also been known to play "Rocky Mountain Way," as seen on the "Farewell Tour I" DVD. These are not Eagles songs however, since the studio cuts did not originate under the Eagles name.
