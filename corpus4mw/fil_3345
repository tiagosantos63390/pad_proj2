The horses trotted between Buran and Ila via the city center until 1901, and transported more than 400 000 passengers in the peak year. Unlike Oslo and Bergen, Trondheim never had horsecars. In 1900, the city council decided to establish a municipally-owned power and tramway company, Trondhjems Elektricitetsværk og Sporvei.

The coach company went bankrupt the year after, failing to make money on a route to Øya.
