"Proof". The identity element formula_158 are two principal divisors coming from formula_15 and formula_5 respectively. Then formula_161 comes from the function formula_162, and thus formula_163 is a principal divisor, too. We conclude that formula_156 is closed under addition and inverses, making it into a subgroup.
The Synaxarion, Menologion, and ("lessons") were added by a later hand. The text of the Gospels is surrounded by a catena.
