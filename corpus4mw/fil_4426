Bottle fermentation is a method of sparkling wine production, originating in the Champagne region where after the cuvee has gone through a primary yeast fermentation the wine is then bottled and goes through a secondary fermentation where sugar and additional yeast known as "liqueur de tirage" is added to the wine. This secondary fermentation is what creates the carbon dioxide bubbles that sparkling wine is known for.
