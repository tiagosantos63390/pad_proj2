Despite the opposition to the Olmsted plan, the city under Mayor Thomas Taggart purchased of land during the early 1900s, including much of what became Riverside Park. That park, however, had not been envisioned in Olmsted's plan. Construction of boulevards along the streams was also begun, with sections of Fall Creek Boulevard between Capitol and Central Avenues and of Pleasant Run Boulevard between Raymond and Beecher Streets being completed by 1906; boulevards along the east side of White River north of Michigan Street and through Riverside Park were also being built.
Tétrault was elected to the Montreal city council in the 2001 municipal election as a Vision Montreal candidate in the Plateau-Mont-Royal division. During the campaign, he called for a speed limit reduction in the Plateau, increased security in parks and at metro stations, more co-op housing and support for local artists, and more parking spots for businesses. Vision Montreal lost the election to Gérald Tremblay's Montreal Island Citizens Union, and Tétrault served as a member of the official opposition.

They arrived at the start of the Sixth Frontier War, prompting Frederick to volunteer his services. This date marks the first of his 'Aquila Caricatures', a series of informative though jocularly offensive barbs directed at Andries Stockenström, the lieutenant governor of British Kaffraria at the time.
