For mobile use the original coastal gun was too heavy, so a smaller version was developed as the 3-inch M1918. For this role the barrel was cut down in length, to 50 calibers from 55, and a new breech was introduced to fire smaller rounds (76.2x585R, 212 cubic inches instead of 76.2x690R, 293 cubic inches). Like the adaptation that created the M2, the M1918 was also fitted with a removable liner in 1928, becoming the 3-inch M3. Another upgrade was started in 1931 as the T8, and then T9, but these projects were cancelled in 1938 when the 90 mm gun was selected in their place.
On July 28, 2014 the construction phase begins.
