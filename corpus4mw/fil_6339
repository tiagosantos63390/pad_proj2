In 1801, "Désirée" was attached to the fleet gathering at Yarmouth under Sir Hyde Parker and Lord Nelson for service in the Baltic Sea against the League of Armed Neutrality. Sailing for Denmark in March, the fleet anchored off Copenhagen and on 1 April a squadron under Nelson closed with the Danish fleet, which was anchored in a line of battle protecting the harbour. "Désirée" was ordered to operate at the Southern end of the Danish line, engaging shore batteries and nearby ships while their attention was focused on the main British battle-line. When the battle began at 10:00 on 2 April, Inman engaged the "Provesteen", which was firing on the 50-gun . "Désirée" succeeded in inflicting considerable damage on the Danish ship and drew some fire away from the battered "Isis". Once "Provesteen" had been abandoned by her Danish crew "Désirée" was engaged with a number of Danish shore batteries, but due to poor aim of the Danish gunners, who fired over the frigate throughout the engagement, she was not badly damaged and suffered only four men wounded in the battle. At 14:00 Danish fire slackened and shortly afterwards Nelson began to withdraw his ships out of range of the Danes. A number of his ships of the line grounded on the complicated shoals in the region and when "Désirée" came to the assistance of ] she too became stuck. "Bellona" was hauled off by "Isis" shortly afterwards, but "Désirée" was forced to remain on the sandbank for two days until boats from the squadron could be spared to drag her free.
Daoud Abdel Sayed is referred to one of the pioneers of a school of thought in Egyptian cinema called “New Realism”. According to Viola Shafik, professor at the American University in Cairo and author of Arab Cinema: history and cultural identity, New Realism appeared in the 1980s as a revival of the wave of realism that had dominated Egyptian cinema in the 1960s. The rise of the original realism in the 1950s called for filmmaking that reflected the daily life of the indigenous Egyptian population, paying attention to the choice of the “simple man” from the lower social class and portraying him as the protagonist. New Realism in turn, called essentially for the same thing but using different mechanisms of action and police film rather than melodrama.
