It was captured by Sir Thomas Fairfax on 17 June 1645 and garrisoned by Parliamentary troops until October the following year.

Traders moved their business to Swindon and Highworth market did not recover until the end of the 17th century. Highworth benefited from the economic boom during the Napoleonic Wars and Industrial Revolution, and many of the houses in the town centre date from this time.From 1894 to 1974 there was a Highworth Rural District but the town now forms part of the unitary authority of Swindon. Highworth was once larger than neighbouring Swindon, when Highworth's population exceeded 12,000.
