The history of RYCL(b) before 2003 is characterized by the ideological fight among the supporters of the RCWP-line and the supporters of other trends. If in 1998 the main "alternative" trend was ultra-left then afterwards (until 2002) rather strong positions in RCYL(b) were taken by so-called "Maoism". Poly-ideological line officially declared by the Maoists and organizational anarchy finished into actual decentralization of the Revolutionary Komsomol, into its degeneration into a net of weakly connected regional groups. The existence of RCYL(b) itself made a problem. In 2002 the RCWP-supporters managed to finish into minimum the influence of this trend. However in 2001–2003 there were some attempts to resuscitate the ultra-left trend in the Revolutionary Komsomol.
