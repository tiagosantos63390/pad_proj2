On the day of the photo shoot, the models were all taken to a photo studio where they saw an exhibit of pictures of Tyra impersonating multiple iconic models. Johnny explained that for the shoot, they would all get paint thrown at them. The finished product would later be displayed in the gallery along with Tyra's photos.
War broke out again in 1282, as a result of a rebellion by Llywelyn’s brother Dafydd, who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277. Dafydd launched a series of attacks co-ordinated with the Welsh rulers in Deheubarth and North Powys, who had been Llywelyn's vassals until 1277 and were now Edward's vassals. Llywelyn and the other Welsh leaders, including those in the south, joined in and it soon assumed a very different character from the 1277 campaign. It became a national struggle enjoying wide support among the Welsh, who were provoked particularly by Edward’s attempts to impose English law on the Welsh. Edward, however, soon began to see it as a war of conquest rather than just a punitive expedition to put down a rebellion.
