He was a pupil of Ippolito Costa and influenced by his contemporary Domenico Fetti. He was employed by the court of the Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga. The painting of "St. Francis intercedes with the Virgin to liberate Mantua from the plague of 1630" for the church of Santa Agnese, but now in the Ducal Palace of Mantua, was attributed to him, but given the date of demise that seems unlikely. He painted for the churches of San Pietro, San Simone, and Santa Croce at Mantua.

"Thalictrum dioicum" grows from 30 to 80 cm tall, from upright caudex, with yellow-gold colored - thick fibrous roots. New caudexes are generated each year by the current years plant and the old caudex withers away in the fall and early spring of the next year. In early spring plants grow, producing glabrous or glandular leaves. both basal and cauline leaves are produced that have long petioles. Leaf blades are 1-4×-ternately compound with leaflets reniform or cordate to obovate or orbiculate in shape. The leaflets are 10-45 mm wide with lobed margins often crenate, and the undersides are normally glabrous or glandular. Inflorescences are panicles or corymbs produced terminally and axillary with many flowered branches. The flowers have no petals but have greenish colored, 1.8-4mm long sepals sometimes tinted purple. The sepals are ovate to obovate or oval in shape. On male plants, the flower filaments are the most showy part of the hanging flowers, being yellow to greenish yellow in color and 3.5-5.5 mm long. The filaments end in anthers 2-4 mm long that are mucronate to acuminate in shape with purple colored stigma. After blooming, female plants if fertilized, produce green fruits called achenes. Each flower that is fertilized typically produces (3-)7 to 13 achenes that are not reflexed and sessile or nearly so in tight clusters. The achenes are ovoid to ellipsoid in shape and not laterally compressed, 3.5-5 mm long, glabrous, very strongly veined, with 1.5 to 3mm long beaks, ripening in mid summer.

Meher Baba states that evolution is the soul's gathering of full consciousness, reincarnation is the state of ordinary people caught up in karma, and involution is the inner journey of the spiritual pilgrim back to its origin through higher planes of consciousness. According to Meher Baba, there are seven inner planes of consciousness beyond the state of ordinary human experience. Ordinary consciousness he calls "gross consciousness" and is entirely of the gross physical world. Planes one through four are of the subtle world ("pran", or energy); planes five and six are of the mental world ("mana", or mind); and plane seven is of the Self.
