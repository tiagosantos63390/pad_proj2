The number of sheets in a ream has varied locally over the centuries, often according to the size and type of paper being sold. Reams of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) were known in England in c.1594; in 1706 a ream was defined as 20 quires, either 24 or 25 sheets to the quire. In 18th- and 19th-century Europe, the size of the ream varied widely. In Lombardy a ream of music paper was 450 or 480 sheets; in Britain, Holland and Germany a ream of 480 sheets was common; in the Veneto it was more frequently 500. Some paper manufacturers counted 546 sheets (21 quires of 26 sheets). J.S. Bach's manuscript paper at Weimar was ordered by the ream of 480 sheets. In 1840, a ream in Lisbon was 17 quires and 3 sheets = 428 sheets, and a double ream was 18 quires and 2 sheets = 434 sheets; and in Bremen, blotting or packing paper was sold in reams of 300 (20 quires of 15 sheets). A mid-19th century Milanese-Italian dictionary has an example for a "risma" (ream) as being either 450 or 480 sheets

Benjamin Whorf described grammatical gender in English as a covert grammatical category. He noted that gender as a property inherent in nouns (rather than in their referents) is not entirely absent from modern English: different pronouns may be appropriate for the same referent depending on what noun has been used. For example, one might say "this child is eating its dinner", but "my daughter is eating her" (not "its") "dinner", even though "child" and "daughter" in the respective sentences might refer to the same person.

He signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on November 30, 2011. After opening the season with the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, he was placed on the Phillies' active roster on May 1 following the injury of reliever David Herndon. He posted a 0–1 record and 11.25 ERA in 3 games before returning to the IronPigs ten days later. On June 28, Sanches was called back up by the Phillies along with Jeremy Horst, to replace Chad Qualls, who was designated for assignment. He was outrighted to Triple-A on July 17. On July 31, Sanches was released by the organization.

Like Li's previous film, "Blind Shaft", which dealt with the notoriously dangerous mining industry, "Blind Mountain" turns a sharply critical eye towards another one of China's continuing social problems, this time selling women for marriage in modern day china.
Career.
Ralstonia pickettii is a gram-negative, rod shaped beta proteobacteria found in moist environments such as soils, river and lakes. It has also been identified in biofilms in plastic water pipes. It is an olgiotrophic organism, making it capable of surviving in areas with a very low concentration of nutrients. Several strains have shown an ability to survive in environments highly contaminated with metals. The ability to persist in these harsh conditions makes R. picketti a unique candidate for bioremediation.
