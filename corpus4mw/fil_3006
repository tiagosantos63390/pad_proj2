On September 2009 he was appointed back at AlbinoLeffe to replace Armando Madonna. He stepped down as head coach of AlbinoLeffe on 29 January 2011 due to "serious health issues", with his assistant Daniele Fortunato taking over on an interim basis. Two days later, his club confirmed he had undergone abdominal surgery, expecting him to recover in a few weeks time. On 15 February, after a full recovery, Mondonico officially returned to his coaching duties at AlbinoLeffe. He guided AlbinoLeffe to narrowly escape relegation after defeating Piacenza in the playoffs, but on 13 June he held an emotional press conference to announce that the illness had returned during the final period of season and that he was seriously considering stepping down as a consequence. On 17 June 2011 Mondonico was confirmed to have resigned from AlbinoLeffe in order to focus solely on cancer treatment; he was replaced by his assistant Daniele Fortunato, who already took first team coaching duties during his previous sick leave. A few months later he announced to have defeated cancer, and also stated to be ready to get back into work.
