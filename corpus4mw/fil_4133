Smith talks about his several encounters with many Hollywood stars, both old and upcoming. Once, during his daughter Harley's elementary school Fairy Tale Breakfast party, he ran into Johnny Depp, still wearing part of his Jack Sparrow makeup, who was in-between filming the "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequels. He also recollects on the time in which he met Burt Reynolds after "stealing" his donuts. An unlikely meeting with Bruce Willis resulted in Smith getting a major supporting part in Willis' film "Live Free or Die Hard". In addition, he mentions a humorous encounter Mewes had at a club during the shoot of "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, who had recently been cast as Spider-Man.
During the 11th century, Earl Leofric was a "great benefactor" of the church. In 1075 Peter, Bishop of Lichfield moved the seat of his see to Chester, making St John's his cathedral until he died in 1085. Peter's successor moved his seat to Coventry, and St John's became a co-cathedral. The building of the church continued on a large scale until the end of the 13th century and continued as a collegiate church of secular canons. Owain Glyndŵr and others made their depositions at the Court of Chivalry inquiry into the Scrope v Grosvenor controversy held here on 3September 1386. After the Dissolution, much of the east end of the church was demolished and some of it remains as ruins to the east of the present church. Since the Dissolution, it has been a parish church. Parish registers began in 1559, and in 1581 the parishioners obtained a grant of fabric from Queen Elizabeth I to restore the nave as a parish church. In 1645 Chester was besieged by Parliamentary forces who used the church as a garrison.
