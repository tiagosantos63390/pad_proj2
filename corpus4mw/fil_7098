Ben T. Epps (February 20, 1888, Oconee County, Georgia - October 16, 1937), known as "Georgia's First Aviator" was an American aviation pioneer. In 1907, he built a monoplane of his own design, now known as the Epps 1907 Monoplane. This was followed by other original monoplane and biplane designs in 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1916, 1924 and 1930. He died of injuries as a result of an airplane crash.
