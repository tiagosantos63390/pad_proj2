Visitors have given overwhelmingly positive reviews to the boardwalk. Despite some concerns about safety, and the lack of city money for a special boardwalk patrol, most people have felt very safe, and the police department reports few incidents. David Sebok, executive director of the Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Corporation, has received calls from most business owners who opposed the boardwalk, saying they are happy now. The number of area businesses increased even before summer's end, and those who already had businesses along the boardwalk reported higher income; some reported their best July ever. Additional development includes Myrtle Beach SkyWheel near Plyler Park, which at 187 feet was at the time of its construction the tallest Ferris wheel in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and similar in design to the Niagara SkyWheel, on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The Collins family planned to spend $7.5 million on the Second Avenue Pier area.

Like Palnatoki, he keeps two more arrows to kill the king in case he fails, but the king does not punish him for saying so, but rather praises him: "The king took that well from him, and all thought it was boldly spoken."

The Savoy Grill, located at 9th and Central, is a longstanding Kansas City, Missouri fine dining establishment that was founded in 1903 and gained historic landmark with the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Many notable figures have visited the restaurant including Harry S. Truman who made frequent visits over his lunch hour when he was the owner/operator of a downtown haberdashery. Booth No. 4, known as the presidents' booth, has been host to Warren Harding, Harry S. Truman, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. During prohibition, rather than remove the bar, drapes were hung up to conceal its presence. The Grill is most famous for its seafood and steaks.
The church was built probably in the late 14th century, and the south chapel was added in the 17th century. In 1899 a new church was built nearer the centre of the settlement, some to the east, and it became redundant. Its fabric deteriorated, by 1937 it was in a state of disrepair, and by 1970 it was in ruins and without a roof. It was restored in 1976–77. It was vested with the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1978, who hold a 999-year lease with effect from 1 November 1978, and was one of the first of the Welsh churches to be acquired by the charity.
