During the early phases of World War II, the Royal Navy provided critical cover during British evacuations from Norway (where an aircraft carrier and 6 destroyers were lost but 338,000 men were evacuated), Dunkirk (where 7,000 RN men were killed) and Crete. In the latter operation Admiral Cunningham ran great risks to extract the Army, and saved many men to fight another day. The prestige of the Navy suffered severe blows when the battlecruiser "Hood" was sunk by the German battleship "Bismarck" in May 1941. Although the "Bismarck" was sunk a few days later, public pride in the Royal Navy was severely damaged as a result of the loss of mighty "Hood".
