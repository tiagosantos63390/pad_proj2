Before his marriage, Jean-Baptiste had previously been involved "à la façon du pays" the style of the country with a native woman who had borne his children. Marie-Anne was tolerant and accepting of the children arising from this previous relationship, although the other woman was jealous and reportedly threatened to poison her. Despite this incident, the Lagimodières generally had good relationships with the Aboriginal peoples they encountered. Marie-Anne was often regarded as an object of curiosity by the Natives during her travels, as she was invariably the first white woman they had ever seen – some were even led to believe that she possessed supernatural powers.

Linnaeus almost certainly chose the scientific name "Boa murina" based on the original Latin description given by A. Seba in 1735: ""Serpens testudinacea americana, murium insidiator"" (spotted) American snake, a predator that lies in wait for mice (and rats). The Latin adjective "murinus" ("murina") in this case would mean "of mice" or "connected with mice," understood in context as "preying on mice", and not as "mouse-gray-colored" (another possible meaning of Latin "murinus") as now often wrongly indicated for "E. murinus". Early English-language sources, such as George Shaw, referred to the "Boa murina" as the "rat boa" and the "Penny Cyclopaedia" (Vol. 5) entry for boa explained: "The trivial name "murina" was given to it from being said to lie in wait for mice." Linnaeus described the appearance of the "Boa murina" in Latin as "rufus maculis supra rotundatis" with rounded spots on upper parts and made no reference to a gray coloration. Early descriptions of the green anaconda by different authors variously referred to the general color as brown, glaucous, green, or gray.

On November 20, 2008, during remarks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Secretary Paulson said, “We are working through a severe financial crisis caused by many factors, including government inaction and mistaken actions, outdated U.S. and global financial regulatory systems, and by the excessive risk-taking of financial institutions. This combination of factors led to a critical stage this fall when the entire U.S. financial system was at risk. This should never happen again. The United States must lead global financial reform efforts, and we must start by getting our own house in order.”

After its unsuccessful attack, the shattered 9th Panzer Division was counterattacked by strong Allied forces. The division engaged the Americans in the city center of Cologne, but were quickly pushed back, and the divisional commander was killed. Remnants of the division attempted to flee across the Rhine River. In the fighting that followed, the weak formation finally collapsed. Most of the remains of the division were forced into the Ruhr Pocket, continuing to suffer staggering losses while holding lines on the south flank of Army Group B until they surrendered to American forces in April 1945. By this time, the demoralized soldiers of the division were entirely out of ammunition and gasoline, and remaining troops surrendering without a fight. The division continued to exist briefly afterward; Major Halle, the division's adjutant, escaped the Ruhr encirclement with a small battle group, and joined the 11th Army in the Harz Mountains. There, on 26 April 1945, German commanders of OB West disbanded the 9th Panzer Division, absorbing its survivors into other units.
