In January 1862, William Dole, U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asked Native American agents to "engage forthwith all the vigorous and able-bodied Native Americans in their respective agencies." The request resulted in the assembly of the 1st and 2nd Indian Home Guard. Many Native American tribes fought in the war including: the Delaware, Creek, Cherokee, Seminole, Kickapoo, Seneca, Osage, Shawnee, Choctaw, Lumbee, Chickasaw, Iroquois, Powhatan, Pequot, Ojibwe (Chippewa), Huron, Odawa, Potawatomi, Catawba, and Pamunkey. The Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Catawba, and Creek tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. Like other American communities, some tribes had members fighting on either side of the war. The majority of the Creek sided with the Union as two-thirds of the people preferred to be guided by the advice of their chief Opothleyahola. Ex-Chief McIntosh was bought by the South, whose leaders appointed him a colonel in the Confederate Army. During November 1861, the Creek, Black Creek Indians, and White Creek Indians of their tribe were led by Creek Chief Opothleyahola, fought three pitched battles (Battle of Round Mountain), and the Battle of Chustenahlah against Confederate white troops and other Native Americans that joined the Confederates to reach Union lines in Kansas, and offer their services.

The name "Octophone" came from the idea that the instrument could take on the "tone combinations" of eight instruments, the tenor guitar, tenor banjo, ukulele, taro patch, tiple, mandolin, mandola and mandocello. Changing from one instrument to another was a matter of changing the tuning. The instrument came with an instruction book that told owners "how to use, how to tune and how to play" the instrument

The same had not been true for the printmaking at Fontainebleau, and the prints made there (unusually for the period, all in etching) were technically rather rough, produced in smaller numbers, and mainly influential in France. They were made in an intense period of activity approximately from 1542 to 1548. Those made in Paris were engravings and of a higher quality; produced from about 1540 to about 1580, they had a wider distribution. Many of the Fontainebleau prints were apparently made directly from drawn designs for the decorations of the palace, and consisted largely or entirely of ornamental frames or cartouches, although such was the scale of Fontainebleau that these might contain several full-length figures. Variations on the elaborate framings, as if made of cut, pierced and rolled parchment, played out in decorative framing schemes, engraved title pages and carved and inlaid furniture into the seventeenth century.

Following the Trio's performance at the 1959 festival, folk music critic Mark Morris wrote "What connection these frenetically tinselly showmen have with a folk festival eludes me...except that it is mainly folk songs that they choose to vulgarize." English folk revivalist Shirley Collins was critical of many of the acts, including Odetta and Bob Gibson, but especially the Trio, stating "I despised them. The audience loved them!"

Ted and Betty begin to develop a connection, since they're both fascinated by theatre. Betty gives Ted some acting tips, after he reveals becoming an actor has always been a secret ambition of his. After dinner, Ted is caught kissing Betty, and Barney is forced to confront him in front of his mother, but the tables are turned when Ted starts using Betty's acting tips to improvise a story that Barney long ago stole his fiancée. Barney then finally tells his mother the truth, and she is relieved because she admits she hates Betty and Tyler. She really hates Tyler because he keeps saying, "Tyler no likey!," (the child actor's attempt to create a catchphrase for his character). After that moment, they share a hug and she tells him to make sure to go for it when he does meet the right girl. At that moment, Robin walks in and Barney looks at her as he tells his Mom he will try. On the ride home, Ted and Betty are in one cab while Barney, Robin, Marshall and Lily are in another. Lily then fakes a conversation on her cell phone with Betty pretending to be Marshall's mother in order to make him think she's on good terms with his mother.
