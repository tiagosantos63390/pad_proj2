In 2012 Murphy wrote, penciled and inked the six-issue, black and white creator-owned Vertigo miniseries "Punk Rock Jesus", which stars a clone of Jesus Christ who starred in his own reality television program as a child, and has grown into a rebellious young man. The miniseries was described as Murphy's "passion project years in the making", and focuses on religion and the media in the United States as themes, more complicated issues than Murphy had previously addressed in his work. The series was inspired by Murphy's reaction to ascendance of Sarah Palin into the national spotlight. Murphy says, "Sarah Palin scared the shit out of me in 2007 -- I was floored that someone that ignorant could come so close to being President. And a lot of her comments were about religion, politics, and the media. It made me want to take action, but I was just a comic book artist and I wasn't sure what I could do. So I started addressing my concerns about these three topics in "Punk Rock Jesus". And I felt I really had something, but then Obama was elected and suddenly the need for "Punk Rock Jesus" was gone. I was an Obama fan, and I'm glad that Palin isn't anywhere near the nuclear codes, but I felt that I'd missed a window where "Punk Rock Jesus" would be most relevant. But 2012 election has brought up all my old concerns, so suddenly "Punk Rock Jesus" feels relevant again." The first two issues of the miniseries received positive reviews by Comic Book Resources, Weekly Comic Book Review, Bleeding Cool and IGN.

Franky is a pitchfork found in the titular barn in Barn Boys. Initially he is an antagonist, as, at the urging of his companions Reg the paint pot and Ron the paint brush, he attacks Conker (or, as he puts it "give 'im a whuppin'"). After Conker defeats him, through guilt, the pitchfork goes back to his supposed friends who, far from comforting him, tell him to kill himself. In despair, he attempts to hang himself from the rafters of the barn (Though not before cussing at his friends and asking what kind of friends they are), and fails miserably due to his lack of "a neck of any description", to the glee of the pot and brush. Conker soon cuts him down with throwing knives and, out of gratitude, Franky aids him in defeating the Haybot, both in the barn and in the basement, which all three fall into after the Haybot destroys the floor. After the Haybot is defeated, Franky finds he has been split in half, and Conker tapes him back together. The basement then begins to flood, and Franky immediately disappears, saying he "have to go", leaving Conker to defend himself against the broken wires and rising water. Franky does not reappear until the throne room at the end. He is voiced by Chris Seavor.

Surprisingly, in November 1997 Ble returned with their second studio album ""Ble"", with George Papapostolou on the lead vocals along with two new singers: English-Jamaican Melody and Giorgia Kefala, a new singer and dancer, currently working with Anna Vissi. Giorgia proved to be an exceptional talented singer and frontwoman and therefore became the lead singer of the band immediately. Critical reviews were extremely warm and what follows was history for the Greek music scene. Ble broke the status quo that wants the band to dissolve or disappear when the singer decides to pursue a solo career and the album "Ble" became a huge success with multiple tracks reaching Number 1 in Greece.
