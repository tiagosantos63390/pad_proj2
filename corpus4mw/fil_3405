Chris Woodstra on AllMusic described it as "the finest moment of their later period, "Fate" is a cohesive and tightly produced album with an edge." Option magazine considered the album as being "filled with raw power, energy, and the belief that the world can be changed and that people do care." A review in Musician stated "Rough-hewn and raw-edged, there's nothing slick or commercially accommodating about Hunters & Collectors. Yet, beneath the band's brassy bluster there's a disarming, almost endearing sentimentality."

Wollbrinck was nearly bankrupted in a downturn of the housing market, but under the name "Central Amusement Company" he ran "Old St. Louis" and another concession at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, after which he became a clerk in the Assessor's office (until 1908, when he was shuffled out in a change of administration). He returned to real estate, organized Everybody's Amusement Company and ran an open-air theater at the corner of Taylor and Delmar. He was a staunch Republican, and though he lost the 1918 election for City Assessor (the Progressives split the bloc and gave the office to Democrat Frank Schramm) St. Louis Mayor Henry Kiel took advantage of a provision of the new city charter to fire Schramm and appoint Wollbrinck. There followed a legal struggle and a nine-months suit before the Missouri Supreme Court. During his tenure, he instituted the state’s income tax, upheld in the often-cited Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co vs. Wollbrinck case. On February 13, 1923, he was granted U.S. patent #1444822, for improvements in the design of the spark plug.

However, due to lead singer Mike Barry's fear of flying, the band never toured to support the record in the UK.

BioLab's Handling Mechanism (HM) is a robotic arm that provides an interface between the ECs and BioLab's analytical instruments, the microscope and spectrophotometer. BioLab's microscope, which can be controlled by investigators on the ground, has a resolution that ranges from 0.6 to 1.8 micrometers (μm) with a 0.25 μm and 1.0 μm diameter field of view, respectively. The spectrophotometer, which uses tungsten and deuterium lamps, can analyze light passed through the sample in the spectral range of 220 to 900 nm (ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared) with a resolution of 10 nm. Finally, the HM also allows automated transfer of samples from the incubator to the ATCS, which can maintain temperatures between -20 and 10 C with an accuracy of +/- 1 C.
