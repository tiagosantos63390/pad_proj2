"One Step Up" is a song by Bruce Springsteen from his 1987 "Tunnel of Love" album. It was released as the third single from the album, following "Brilliant Disguise" and the title track. It reached position #13 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States. It also reached #2 on the U.S. Album Rock Tracks chart, giving Springsteen three straight top two tracks from the album. The song was only released as a single in America.
In August 1943, the positions were reversed and St Angelo was designated as a subsidiary satellite airfield for No. 17 Group RAF Coastal Command which had established its headquarters at RAF Killadeas and commanded all Lough Erne flying boat squadrons. St Angelo became home to several squadrons of Consolidated PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland flying boats operating from Lough Erne. Later that year, Bristol Beaufighters of No. 235 Squadron RAF were based at St Angelo during anti-submarine patrols in the Irish Sea and over the Atlantic Ocean.
