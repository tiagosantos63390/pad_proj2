Personal life.
The railroad was originally constructed as a single track from Carbondale to Honesdale. It contained 5 planes ascending from Carbondale to the summit at Rix's Gap in the Moosic Mountains, and three planes on the descent to Honesdale where the railroad terminated at the D&H Canal. Each ascending plane was powered by a stationary steam engine which lifted the loaded cars to a "level" which was graded slightly to allow the loaded cars to roll by gravity to the foot of the next plane. In the opposite direction, the empty cars were towed by horses. Each plane contained a single track, with an automatically switched siding in the center where the loaded and empty cars could pass.
