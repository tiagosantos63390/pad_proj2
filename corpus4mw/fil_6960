For its sixth week of competition, Michigan traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts to face the Harvard Crimson. The game was scoreless after three periods, with Harvard having the best scoring opportunities. Harvard had driven deep into Michigan territory twice, and one field goal attempt was blocked by Maynard Morrison and another was missed. Early in the fourth quarter, Harvard drove the ball to Michigan's 12-yard line. On fourth down, Harvard successfully converted on a field goal attempt to take a 3 to 0 lead. In the closing minutes of the game, Newman led Michigan's final drive. Newman and Roy Hudson began the drive running the ball to Harvard's 35-yard line. It was from that point that Newman threw the winning touchdown pass described by the "Associated Press" as follows:"Newman then backed up to the 50-yard line, waited until Hudson, whose jersey, fore and aft, bore the supposedly ill-fated number 13, had time to clear the Harvard secondaries. When that speedy fullback gained the open, in the vicinity of the 30-yard marker, Newman tossed him a lofty pass and he out-footed his Harvard pursuers across their goal line."
