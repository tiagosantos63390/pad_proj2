After finishing bottom of Division one of the Athenian league at the end of the 1973–74 season, the club left the league to become founder members of the Kent League. In the nineties they were the dominant team in the Kent League, winning the title four times, with the 1996–97 season being their best when they completed a treble by also winning the Kent Senior Trophy and the Kent League Division 1 Cup. Despite these league wins the club was denied promotion due to their ground not meeting the requirements of a higher league. In the 2011–12 season under manager Simon Halsey and with work done on their ground, the club finished champions of the Kent league again and this time earned promotion to the Isthmian League Division One South.
