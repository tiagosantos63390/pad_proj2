The two matches aside, Hassett had a productive lead-in to the Tests, scoring 110 against Surrey and two fifties. One of these came in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and was basically a full-strength Test team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia batted first and Hassett made 51 in an innings win. Fingleton hailed Hassett's display as "the prettiest half century we saw in the whole summer. There was not effort in his play. The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions."
Statistics and legacy.
Following his retirement from big cricket, Darling returned to his Tasmanian sheep station, where he was involved in a range of agricultural activities. He pioneered measures to eradicate rabbits, an introduced pest then in plague proportions throughout Australia. He was an active member of organisations such as the Tasmanian Stock Holders and Orchardists' Association and the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, the organising body of the Royal Hobart Show. Darling imported South Australian merino rams to improve his flock, and his wool topped the Hobart sales on several occasions. He also introduced subterranean clover to Tasmania.

The most popular color for Carnival Glass is now known by collectors as 'marigold' although that name was not in use at the time. Marigold has a clear glass base and is the most easily recognizable carnival color. The final surface colors of marigold are mostly a bright orange-gold turning perhaps to copper with small areas showing rainbow or 'oil-slick' highlights. The highlights appear mostly on ridges in the pattern and vary in strength according to the light.

Guruvayurappan (, (transliterated guruvāyūrappan), ) also often written Guruvayoorappan, the presiding deity of Guruvayoor temple is being worshiped as Shri Krishna in his kid form, popularly known as Guruvayur Unnikkannan (Guruvayur baby Krishna). Even though the idol is that of "chatur bahu" (four handed) Vishnu, the concept ("Sankalpam") of the people is that the idol is the infant form of Lord Krishna. This irony is because the idol represents the "purna rupa" (full manefestation) revealed by baby Krishna to his parents immediately after his birth in Kamsa's jail. Lord Krishna immediately after his birth had revealed himself as four armed standing Vishnu in front of his parents Devaki and Vasudeva. So that may be why baby Krishna is worshiped on a Vishnu idol, even though he was not installed in that concept. The temple is located in the town of Guruvayur, Thrissur, Kerala, India.
