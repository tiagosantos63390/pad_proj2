Matthew Fletcher came from a family of mine owners and his first notable work was on the property of another mine owner, John Heathcote. During the 1740s, Heathcote had attempted to sink Wet Earth Colliery, the first deep coal mine in the Irwell Valley at Clifton. The workings were plagued with water from the River Irwell via the Pendleton Fault. Heathcote engaged Fletcher to advise on how to solve the flooding. John Heathcote closed the pit in 1750. Heathcote and Fletcher were at a loss as how to dewater the pit until it came to the attention of Heathcote's relation, James Brindley. He was a canal engineer whose feats included the Bridgewater and Trent and Mersey Canals. He suggested using a Newcomen atmospheric pumping engine but the engine had been plagued with problems. His revised scheme relied on water power but there was no flowing water on the site to power a pump and the pithead was above the level of the River Irwell.

The novel can be read alone in its entirety. Presented as Straka's nineteenth and final novel before his mysterious death, "Ship of Theseus" tells the story of an amnesiac on a strange journey to discover himself. Straka's enigmatic life and death are considered one of the literary world's greatest mysteries and enshrouded by conspiracy theories and claims of espionage and assassination. His identity is the subject of much scholarly debate as evidenced by a foreword and footnotes from F.X. Caldeira, Straka's chosen translator for many of his books including "Ship of Theseus," though even Caldeira never encountered Straka face-to-face.
