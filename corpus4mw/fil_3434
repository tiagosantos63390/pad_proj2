In addition to different B cells reacting to "different" epitopes on the same antigen, B cells belonging to different clones may also be able to react to the "same" epitope. An epitope that can be attacked by many different B cells is said to be highly "immunogenic". In these cases, the "binding affinities" for respective epitope-paratope pairs vary, with some B cell clones producing antibodies that bind strongly to the epitope, and others producing antibodies that bind weakly.
