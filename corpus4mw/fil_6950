The lower garden had a large marble fountain that was meant to be seen against a backdrop of dark cypresses, with figures of Hercules and Antaeus. Just above this fountain, in the center of the garden, was a labyrinth formed by cypress, laurel, myrtle, roses and box hedges. Concealed in the middle of the labyrinth was another fountain, with a statue of Venus. Around this fountain, Cosimo had bronze pipes installed under the tiles for "giochi d'acqua" ("water tricks"), which were concealed conduits which could be turned on with a key to drench unsuspecting guests. Another unusual feature was a treehouse concealed in an ivy-covered oak tree, with a square dining room inside the tree. 
Recreational activities at Akyatan are strictly limited to birdwatching and guided nature walks. Picnicking and camping are not allowed at the reserve. The only way of getting to Akyatan with public transport is to take a minibus from Adana to Karataş and taking a taxi from there.
