HMS "Beagle" arrived on 15 March 1833. Vernet dispatched his deputy Matthew Brisbane to the islands to take charge of his settlement March 1833. Meeting with Captain Fitzroy of the "Beagle", he was encouraged to continue with Vernet's enterprise provided there was no attempt to further the ambitions of the United Provinces. Like Onslow before him, Fitzroy was forced to use his powers of persuasion to encourage the gauchos to continue working in Vernet's establishment:
There are commonly 10 players on the field at once (9 fielders and one pitcher). The reason for this surplus is that although there are 9 players on the field "from each team", the pitcher pitches to his or her own team (unlike regular baseball or softball). Therefore, the pitcher would not want to make a play as to force his or her own teammate to become out. The pitcher must throw all pitches underhand. Every pitch is considered a strike, regardless of whether it crosses the strike zone or not. This keeps the game from slowing down due to balls, and also compensates for the ease of hitting (due to the teammate pitcher). The extra fielder that the defensive team gains is commonly referred to as the "rover." The rover's job is to position him or herself between the infield and the outfield to catch all of the "blooper hits."

The former Martha Graham dancer kicked off her shoes, jumped up on the middle of the table, and struck a pose. The photo was only published for the first time more than 15 years later in Kennerly's book "Photo Op".
