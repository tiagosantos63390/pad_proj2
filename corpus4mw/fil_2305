"TV Comic" is notable for printing "Doctor Who" stories from 1964 to 1979 (except for the period between 1971 and 1973, when the strip was instead published in another Polystyle title, "Countdown/TV Action"). It also featured strip cartoons for the early puppet TV series produced by Gerry Anderson and AP Films—"Four Feather Falls", "Supercar" and "Fireball XL5"—until Anderson's titles became the focus of a rival publication, "TV Century 21".
Gobbolino is a little black kitten born in a witch's cave high up on Hurricane mountain with one white paw after it was bathed in moonlight, and sparkling blue eyes who was born to be a witch's cat with his pure black twin sister, Sootica. While his sister is quite happy to learn spells and turn mice into toads, Gobbolino longs to be a humble kitchen cat; and he embarks on a great adventure to seek out his heart's desire.
