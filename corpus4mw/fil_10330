The film was initially titled "Amma Appa Vilaiyaatu" and was completed in the 1990s but remained unreleased. In 2001, the makers of the film re-emerged and chose to release it under a new title "En Iniya Ponnilave", taken from the song from Balu Mahendra's 1981 film "Moodu Pani".

Brooks' interest in the 369th Infantry Division sparked as a 10-year-old, when a tutor told him their story. As an adult, Brooks attempted to have their story turned into a film, pitching his script across the movie industry to no avail. The various studios Brooks sought out believed that World War I had been rendered obscure to the general American public; they believed a film dealing with the subject would not be profitable. Finally, after collaborating with White on a to his novel The Zombie Survival Guide in 2006, Brooks realized the story could be told within the comics medium sans the financial concerns of film.
