The kori bustard is often found in areas with a large quantity of antelope and other game. In Tanzania, kori bustards regularly attend blue wildebeest ("Connochaetes taurinus") herds and feed on the small mammals disturbed by them. Sometimes kori bustards are found with southern carmine bee-eaters ("Merops nubicoides") and northern carmine bee-eaters ("Merops nubicus") riding on their backs as they stride through the grass. The bee-eaters make the most of their walking perch by hawking insects from the bustard's back that are disturbed by the bustard's wandering. This is regularly seen in Chobe National Park, Botswana but has only been reported once elsewhere. There is also one record of fork-tailed drongos ("Dicrurus adsimilis") perching on their backs in a similar manner. Kori bustards have been observed to behave aggressively to non-threatening animals at watering holes, as they may raise their crests, open their wings and peck aggressively. They have been seen acting aggressively towards red-crested korhaans ("Eupodotis ruficrista"), springbok ("Antidorcas marsupialis"), plains zebra ("Equus burchelli") and gemsbok ("Oryx gazella"). When kept in captivity, kori bustards have been kept together with numerous other (typically African) species in close quarters. Fifteen other bird species and 12 mammals have successful co-habitated with them (even rhinoceros). However, the bustards sometimes injure or kill the young of everything from waterfowl to dik-diks and may be killed by larger species from ostriches ("Struthio camelus") to zebras ("Equus" ssp.).
History.
Gunfire erupted from three police firearms when the suspect pointed what was then believed to be a pistol at officers, and began making his way to exit the restaurant. The suspect's weapon was later revealed to be only an airsoft handgun, which strongly resembled a legitimate pistol, and appeared to operate in the same manner. The suspect, in addition to "Cops" audio technician Bryce Dion, were hit by police fire, and transported to the hospital where they were both pronounced dead shortly thereafter.

Peter Kember (born 19 November 1965) is an English musician and producer, more usually known as Sonic Boom, and was a founding member of alternative rock band Spacemen 3.

The station signed on in 1926 as Newark-licensed WAAT and was founded by the Bremer Broadcasting Company. WAAT originally broadcast on 1270 AM, and changed frequencies several times (moving to 1070 in 1928, 940 in 1930) before settling on 970Â kHz in 1941, as per the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement. In 1947 Bremer launched an FM adjunct, WAAT-FM (94.7, now WNSH), and the following year a sister television station, WATV began broadcasts on channel 13. In 1951 the stations were sold to Irving Rosenhaus; WAAT evolved to a middle of the road music format by the 1950s, similar to what WNEW, WOR, and WCBS were doing at that time. WAAT later attempted a country music format, the first in the New York area.
