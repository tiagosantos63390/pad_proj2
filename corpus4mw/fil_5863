The 30 October 1626, Margareta was to have said "blasphemies" and called upon Satan; afterward, she claimed to have had a visit from seven high rank devils. 22 October, she said she was visited by three angels with burning candles, among them the Archangel Michael. She was then unconscious for 24 hours. When she awakened, she claimed that angels and devils had fought for her soul and that she had seen the "Glory of the Lord". Between 9 December 1626 and 3 January 1627, she said she had been visited by a litany of angels, and that she had now became their channel, and that what she said was in fact their words. Margareta now foretold that a miracle in Poland should create peace in the war, that a plague should come; she talked about the Sun and the stars and also about clothes, condemning the use of crinolines, big starch collars for vicars, many colors and that blue starch was the vomit of Satan while white starch was pleasing to the Lord.
