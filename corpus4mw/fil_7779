The Wilmington, Onslow and East Carolina Railroad was incorporated by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1885 and existed until 1893, when it was merged into the Wilmington, Newbern and Norfolk Railroad. It eventually became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.
In the "Science" journal article, GFAJ-1 is referred to as a strain of Halomonadaceae and not as a new species. The International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria, the set of regulations which govern the taxonomy of bacteria, and certain articles in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology contain the guidelines and minimal standards to describe a new species, e.g. the minimal standards to describe a member of the "Halomonadaceae". Organisms are described as new species if they meet certain physiological and genetic condition, such as generally less than 97% 16S rRNA sequence identity to other known species) and metabolic differences allowing them to be discerned apart. In addition to indicators to tell the novel species from other species, other analyses are required, such as fatty acid composition, respiratory quinone used and tolerance ranges and deposition of the strain in at least two microbiological repositories. New proposed names are given in italics followed by "sp. nov." (and "gen. nov." if it is a novel genus according to the descriptions of that clade). In the instance of the GFAJ-1 strain these criteria are not met, and the strain is not claimed to be a new species. When a strain is not assigned to a species (e.g. due to insufficient data or author choice) it is often labeled as the genus name followed by "sp." (i.e., undetermined species of that genus) and the strain name. In the case of GFAJ-1 the authors chose to refer to the strain by strain designation only. Strains closely related to GFAJ-1 include "Halomonas" sp. GTW and "Halomonas" sp. G27, neither of which were described as valid species.

Specialized continue to produce the Stumpjumper, which, like mountain bikes in general, has evolved significantly since 1981 and now comes in full (front and rear) suspension and hardtail (front suspension only) options, with the former named the Stumpjumper FSR.
