It is numbered 563 in the Perry Index and can be compared to Aesop's "The Lion and the Mouse" in both its general trend and in its moral of the reciprocal nature of mercy.
2. The constraints of maximum flow and minimum cost flow problems yield a coefficient matrix with these properties (and with empty "C"). Thus, such network flow problems with bounded integer capacities have an integral optimal value. Note that this does not apply to multi-commodity flow problems, in which it is possible to have fractional optimal value even with bounded integer capacities.

The producers were looking for a small, "old-fashioned, New England-type" town close to New York, when they serendipitously discovered New Milford, Connecticut, and, upon having lunch there at "The Bistro Cafe", decided the town would be the perfect choice to portray the fictional home-town of Deeds, Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, and the cafe was a great location to use as "Deeds' Pizza" restaurant. Some scenes were also shot in Carmel, New York.
