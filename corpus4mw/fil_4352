In adult literature, Donnelly has written two detective books for Piper Verlag: "Kein einziges Wort" and "Wen der Tod entlässt". Both books star a German-Austrian female funeral parlor owner with a fondness for tango. For unknown reasons, critics have mainly ignored these books. ORF is planning a TV series based on the books. "Für Paare verboten", published by Hoffmann und Campe, is a caricature of the tantra therapy scene. Donnelly has also written an amusing travel guide "Gebrauchsweisung für Mallorca" (2002). "Das Glasauge" (Donnelly's autobiography), "Wendelburgs Komplott" and "Die Hühnerleiter ins Nirvana" are books-on-demand also available as e-book.
