At the 2012 Australian Open, Azarenka defeated defending champion Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals in three sets to reach her first grand slam singles final where she rallied from 2â€“0 down in the first set to defeat former Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova in straight sets and thus win her first grand slam singles title. With this achievement, Azarenka became the first player representing Belarus to win a Grand Slam title in singles. She also became the World No. 1 for the first time in her career as a result of the victory and thus became the first Belarusian player to hold the top ranking in singles. Following this victory, Azarenka extended her winning streak since the start of the year to 26 consecutive matches by winning titles in Doha and Indian Wells before losing in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Sony Ericsson Open to Marion Bartoli.
