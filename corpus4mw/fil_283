The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality. – Hermann Minkowski, 1908
The type specimen is from the Gulf of Martaban coast of Myanmar, while other referred specimens were found on the Bay of Bengal coast of Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Taiwan. A population found off southern and southwestern Japan in the East China Sea has also been referred to "B. edeni". A whale that stranded in Hong Kong and another saved from a river in eastern Australia were found to be closely related to the Junge specimen and the East China Sea whales. Bryde's whale (most had auxiliary ridges) of small size – estimated at 10.1 to 11.6 m (33 to 38 ft) in length – sighted off the northeastern side of the Solomon Islands during a survey in late November and early December 1993 may be referable to "B. edeni". Four of the whales – estimated at 11.3 to 11.6 m (37 to 38 ft) in length – were accompanied by calves – which ranged from 6 to 6.7 m (19.5 to 22 ft) in length. It is unknown whether eight small individuals – reaching only 11.2 to 11.7 m (36.7-38.4 ft) at maturity – caught off western and eastern Australia between 1958 and 1963 are specimens of "B. edeni" or "B. omurai".
Proponents of a pre-Columbian, yet non-Native American, origin for the site argue that some stones are encased in trees that may have sprouted before the arrival of the first colonists, claim that there are similarities between the ruins and Phoenician architecture, and say that marks on some stones resemble some ancient writing systems of the Old World. The late Barry Fell, a marine biologist from Harvard University and amateur epigrapher, claimed that inscriptions at the site represented markings in Ogham, Phoenician and Iberian scripts, which he also called Iberian-Punic.
