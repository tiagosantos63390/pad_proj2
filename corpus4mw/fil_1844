On 18 April 1977 the company served a writ of "ultra vires" on ACAS, alleging that it had exceeded its authority by canvassing the opinions of the strikers. The case was heard during June–July 1977. In his judgement, delivered 12 July 1977, Lord Widgery, the Lord Chief Justice, dismissed the claim by Grunwick that the ACAS report should be declared void. Lord Widgery said that ACAS had "made all reasonably practicable efforts to canvass staff opinion", but had been prevented speaking to all employees as Grunwick had deliberately withheld their names and addresses. He said "I am satisfied that Mr. Ward could have supplied these lists at any time but declined to do so in the belief that he could thereby exercise some control over the proceedings." He also "rejected Grunwick's contention that the dismissed strikers could no longer be legally recognized as workers concerned with the dispute." Grunwick were ordered to pay costs, in the region of £7,000, to APEX and ACAS. Ward stated that he would refer the case to the Court of Appeal.
In January 2007, he signed a loan deal with English club Leeds United. who were battling relegation in the Football League Championship. He signed for the remainder of the 2006–07 Football League season, with an option for Leeds to buy him at a fixed transfer fee at the end of the season. Ankergren established himself as a firm favourite with the Leeds fans and displaced Neil Sullivan, Tony Warner and Graham Stack, putting in a number of matchwinning saves and performances. His popularity was further increased during the 1–0 victory over Luton Town when he made his second save from a penalty kick since joining Leeds. An injury temporarily forced him out of the side with another Leeds loanee goalkeeper Graham Stack taking his place, although Ankergen reclaimed his place in the side once he regained match fitness. He soon made it publicly known that he wanted to continue his stay at Leeds past his loan spell, and Leeds' manager Dennis Wise stated he wanted to keep Ankergen at the club.

Split teams level on points using the results from the matches between them.

Also, the head-to-head record will not decide it if the game between them was a No result, or if they played each other twice, and won one game each.

The extreme dryness of the climate of Egypt accounts for the existence of a number of woodcarvings from this remote period. Some wood panels from the tomb of Hosul Egypt, at Sakkarah are of the III. dynasty. The carving consists of Egyptian hieroglyphs and figures in low relief, and the style is extremely delicate and fine. A stool shown on one of the panels has the legs shaped like the fore and hind limbs of an animal, a form common in Egypt for thousands of years.
