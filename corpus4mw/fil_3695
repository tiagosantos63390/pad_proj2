Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, is important in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Scientists have demonstrated that ACC2 knockout mice have reduced body fat and weight when compared to wild type mice. This is a result of decreased activity of ACC which causes a subsequent decrease in malonyl-CoA concentrations. These decreased malonyl-CoA levels in turn prevent inhibition of CPT1, causing an ultimate increase in fatty acid oxidation. Since heart and skeletal muscle cells have a low capacity for fatty acid synthesis, ACC may act purely as a regulatory enzyme in these cells.

"Underlyingly", each syllable of every morpheme may be described as having one of two tone types: high (H [ ¯ ]) and null (ø). On the surface, all remaining null tones default to low (the LTA rule below) and the language is therefore spoken with two contrasting tonemes (H and L).

Mere Theory's debut full-length album, "Catalan Atlas" was released via a license deal with Melbourne based Boomtown Records in September 2007. The album received favourable reviews including Rolling Stone, BLUNT and The Adelaide Advertiser. In BLUNT issue No. 66, Catalan Atlas was dubbed one of the "Top 100 Albums You Should've Heard In 2007." Their review went on to say "They had already released two fairly decent EPs, but Adelaide foursome Mere Theory took a giant leap in 2007 with their debut album, "Catalan Atlas". Taking all the best bits from the likes of Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas Is The Reason and Elliott, then integrating them into their own Oz punk stylings, Mere Theory came out with a rock album of international standard."
