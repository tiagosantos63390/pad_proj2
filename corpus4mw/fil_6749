In March 1944 the German Sixth Army was threatened with encirclement by Soviet troops. The 138th and 144th Mountain Infantry Regiments of the 3rd Mountain Division were ordered to hold a bridgehead at the Inhulets River against Soviet counterattacks until the German forces could evacuate the area. The second most successful Austro-German sniper of the war and (possibly) co-recipient of the Knight's Cross, Josef Allerberger, witnessed the Count's injury (and subsequent death) and recalls the incident in his memoirs.

The mall contains the Gondolania Theme Park, an indoor theme park which includes the Gondolania Ice Rink, one of two ice hockey rinks in Qatar, which is the home of the Qatar Ice Hockey League and the regional Desert Cup tournament. It is the only Olympic-size rink in Qatar. Also included are a ten pin bowling center and a rollercoaster.

In July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. 
"Jouvea's" closest relative in the Chloridoideae subfamily is likely Monanthochloe; both share the characteristic of distichously arranged leaves, and within species both have their staminate and pistillate flowers on separate plants.
