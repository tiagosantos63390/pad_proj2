The fishery of "P. monodon" in Chile is divided into two areas, of which the southern unit is the more important. The artisanal fishery of "P. monodon" was banned in the southern unit for three years, from 1980 to 1982, in an attempt to restore the collapsing population. Afterwards, quotas were put in place to limit the fishery, although another three-year ban, was required from 1989 to 1991.

In order to avoid that failure, the Combat Car was designed using three big road-wheels with rubber tires that also served as rollers. All six wheels were 38x7 inch pneumatic tires with bullet resistant tubes and were fitted with metal disc supports to help reduce the chance of bullets or shrapnel piercing the tires, potentially disabling the tank.
