The drawback of prolonging inspiration, and, in effect, inverting the I:E ratio (2:3), is that the patient may experience a lot of discomfort, and requires deep sedation. Further, incomplete expiration tends to reduce CO2 elimination, and the patient will develop “permissive hypercapnia” and respiratory acidosis. As we now know that ventilator induced lung injury causes much more trouble than respiratory acidosis, we do not consider the latter to be a major problem (4).
