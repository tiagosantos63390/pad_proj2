New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis said that "How to be Loved" is my new favorite overall album by Todd Agnew, surpassing the excellent "Reflection of Something". There's biblical truth married to personal lyrics in the songs "The One You Want", "There Is Coming A Day", "Loved", "Don't You Think" and the stunning "House of Boxes". "God Undefeatable", "Letting Go" and "Your Great Name" are incredible songs for the Church that are all instantly sing-able and worshipful arrangements that you'll want to add to your Sunday morning set-list. We often feel ashamed and unworthy of God's perfect Love, but that's the point. We aren’t worthy and God still wants all of us and loves us deeply. This entire album is about giving and accepting love. "How to be Loved" is one of the top albums of the year."
