Until 21 December 2007 when both Slovakia and Hungary became part of the Schengen Area, Štúrovo was a major border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary, with Esztergom located on the Hungarian side of the River Danube. The two cities are linked by the Mária Valéria bridge. The road bridge is some 500 metres in length and is named after Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, (1868–1924), the fourth child of Emperor Franz Josef, and Elisabeth.
In cricket, roundarm bowling is a style that was introduced in the first quarter of the 19th century and had largely superseded underarm bowling by the 1830s. Using a roundarm action, the bowler has his arm extended at about 90 degrees from his body at the point where he releases the ball. Roundarm fell into decline after 1864 when the current style of overarm bowling was legalised, although widely famous English cricketer W G Grace continued to use it to the end of his career.

When glass is fused, unless the separate pieces are of the same COE (co-efficient-of-expansion) the pieces will shatter as the different types of glass cool, as not being the same COE will cause them to contract at differing rates, causing stress fractures to appear between the pieces fused together. Many companies make glass of the same COE, such as the Spectrum glass system 96, which has also been adopted by other manufacturers so that glass from different companies can be used in the same piece without fear of destruction.

At approximately 8:14 AM CDT (1314 UTC), the New Orleans office of the National Weather Service issued a Flash Flood Warning for Orleans Parish and St Bernard Parish, citing a levee breach at the Industrial Canal.

The other main difference in sighting arrangements was the use of an elevation angle or alternatively the range. This issue became more complicated in World War I when the effects of barrel wear in changing muzzle velocity were fully recognised. This meant that different guns needed a different elevation angle for the same range. This led many armies to use an elevation angle calculated in a battery command post. However, in the 1930s the British adopted calibrating sights in which range was set on the sight, which automatically compensated for the difference of muzzle velocity from standard.

Similarly, a forward air controller will help friendly air units adjust their aim in subsequent airstrikes.

This introduces the antagonism between Jesus and "the Jews", as John calls them, a sign perhaps of a non-Jewish audience. This is over the nature of the Temple. The Temple is already destroyed by the time of the writing of John, and John is trying to show right from the start that the old Temple has been replaced by the new Temple, Jesus' resurrected body and the new Christian and Johannine community. This shows to most scholars the split between John's community and Judaism in general. Some of the Dead Sea scrolls also speak of the community as the temple (Brown et al. 954).

Every "contrada" has its own museum, fountain and baptismal font, motto, allied "contrada" (only "Oca" has no allies) and adversary "contrada", typically a neighbor (only four, "Bruco", "Drago", "Giraffa" and "Selva", have no declared adversaries). Often the adversary "contrade" share borders.
