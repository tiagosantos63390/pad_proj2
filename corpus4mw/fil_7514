"Midnight on Dagger Alley" is a solitary adventure designed to be played with one of three sixth-level characters (monk, assassin, or thief) provided in the module. Each of these characters has a matching mission, and the action takes place in the waterfront area of a town depicted in four maps representing the four levels of the area (rooftops, second story, street level, and underground). The three given adventures involve rescuing a princess, searching for hidden treasure, and going on a scavenger hunt for the components of a complex spell, although the player character can have an adventure just wandering around.
