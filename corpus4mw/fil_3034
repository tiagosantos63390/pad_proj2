Paula Jean Brown (who took Jane Wiedlin's spot in the band just before it broke up) co-wrote the song with Jim Whelan, and Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey sang back-up vocals. "Mad About You" was one of a very few songs that were being considered to be on the fourth (unrecorded) Go-Go's album. The Go-Go's split and "Mad About You" and two other songs co-written by Paula Jean Brown wound up on "Belinda" instead.
