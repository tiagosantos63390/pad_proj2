For Allmusic Scott Yanow wrote "This magnificent three-disc set has the first 63 recordings by Count Basie's Orchestra, all of his Deccas. The consistency is remarkable (with not more than two or three turkeys) and the music is the epitome of swing... This is the first Count Basie collection to acquire and should be in every jazz collection".

There is no consensus on the linguistic affiliation of Mapudungun, the Mapuche language. In the early 1970s significant linguistic affinities between Mapuche and Mayan languages were suggested. Linguist Mary Ritchie Key claimed in 1978 that Araucanian languages, including Mapuche, were genetically linked to the Pano-Tacanan languages, to the Chon languages and the Alacalufan languages. Croese (1989, 1991) has advanced the hypothesis that Mapudungun is related to Arawak.
