"Reporting Scotland" was launched on 1 April 1968 - for much of its earlier history, the programme was presented from Glasgow, Edinburgh & Aberdeen and integrated into the "Nationwide" strand. As with the other parts of the UK, the "Reporting Scotland" news team often contributed reports to the "Nationwide" programme. When "Nationwide" ended in 1983, "Reporting Scotland" was briefly replaced by "Scotland Sixty Minutes" as part of the revamped news programme, "Sixty Minutes", but was reinstated in 1984. Since that time, the name ""Reporting Scotland"" has also been used as the on-screen identity for all of BBC Scotland's television news bulletins.
In Ireland, the equivalent is called First Year, the first year of secondary school. Students are usually 12â€“13 years old.
