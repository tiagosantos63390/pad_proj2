Puerto Rico Highway 172 has about 4 kilometers going uphill. One side of the road is extremely close to the blasted mountain ("See Blasting"), meaning that landslides would fall in the right lane of the direction close to it; the other side is near a precipice, with barriers that are not safe. The two directions are not divided, and cars can easily collide front-to-front. Several people have died in this highway, including cars which have been collided by heavy-weight trucks that come so fast downhill their brakes malfunction or don't have to time to stop. The most recent death occurred August 16, 2014. Only one emergency ramp has been built to provide safety in the down part of the mountain.
