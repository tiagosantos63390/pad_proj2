Through the forties and fifties, the Inn thrived. But by the 1960s, survival became nearly impossible with the changing vacationing habits of the modern traveler. The Inn struggled mightily under a succession of owners until February 28, 1979 when it closed its doors. On May 22, 1979, Richard D. Rasor purchased the Bethel Inn. In 1986, the business underwent a $7,500,000 expansion project, funded primarily by the sale of 40 new condominiums, in order to finance a conference center and health club.

For a film as awful, as cliche ridden, as derivative as unimaginative and as poorly made as "Bloodmoon" to be made in Australia in 1990 is a cause of national mourning.
