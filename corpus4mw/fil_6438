After graduating from university Norbury entered the legal profession and was called to the Irish Bar in 1770. In 1781 he was appointed a King's Counsel. Norbury was returned to the Irish Parliament for Tralee in 1773, a seat he held until 1780, and later represented Philipstown between 1783 and 1790 and Gorey from 1790 until the Act of Union in 1801. In 1789 he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, which he remained until 1798 when he was promoted to Attorney-General for Ireland and sworn of the Irish Privy Council. In his role as Attorney-General he was responsible for the prosecution of those involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. According to The Dictionary of National Biography "his indifference to human suffering … disgusted even those who thought the occasion called for firmness on the part of government". In 1799, he brought forward a law which gave the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland power to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act and to install martial law.

In 1719 he published his dictionary of British antiquities under the title of "Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum, sive Syllabus Etymologicus Antiquitatum Veteris Britanniae atque Iberniae temporibus Romanorum." This work was republished by Moses Williams. The same editor brought out Baxter's fragmentary posthumous work, his glossary of Roman antiquities, under the title of "Reliquiae Baxterianae, sive W. Baxteri Opera Posthuma." It went only through the letter A. There is a life of the author written by himself accompanying it. He had prepared an edition of Juvenal with commentary and notes; but, in spite of Moses Williams's proposals, it never appeared.

Japanese theatre styles have been applied to "The Tempest". In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of "The Tempest" to the UK. It was staged as a rehearsal of a Noh drama, with a traditional Noh theatre at the back of the stage, but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions.

Following the end of World War II, various members of the United States Congress proposed bills to establish volunteer organizations in developing countries. In December 1951 Representative John F. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) suggested to a group that "young college graduates would find a full life in bringing technical advice and assistance to the underprivileged and backward Middle East ... In that calling, these men would follow the constructive work done by the religious missionaries in these countries over the past 100 years." In 1952 Senator Brien McMahon (D-Connecticut) proposed an "army" of young Americans to act as "missionaries of democracy". Privately funded nonreligious organizations began sending volunteers overseas during the 1950s. While Kennedy is credited with the creation of the Peace Corps as president, the first initiative came from Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Jr. (D-Minnesota), who introduced the first bill to create the Peace Corps in 1957—three years before the University of Michigan speech. In his autobiography "The Education of a Public Man", Humphrey wrote, 
After the boycott of 1904, the World Series was played every year until 1994 despite World War I, the global influenza pandemic of 1918–19, the Great Depression of the 1930s, America's involvement in World War II, and even an earthquake in the host cities of the 1989 World Series. A breakdown in collective bargaining led to a strike in August 1994 and the eventual cancellation of the rest of the season, including the playoffs.
