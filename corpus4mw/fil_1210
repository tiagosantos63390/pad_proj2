Transcona was founded in 1909 as the site of the repair shops for the Grand Trunk Pacific and National Transcontinental Railways. Its name is derived from combining "Trans"continental with Strath"cona", the name of Donald Smith, Lord Strathcona, a former Manitoban who was instrumental in building Canada's first railway.

It is believed that "News at Ten" was one of the first news programmes to create the 'reporter package' that remains a staple of the news industry today. Also, the programme is notable for introducing a presenting team of two newscasters rather than one: the two newscasters would take turns to read news stories, allowing any late breaking news to be handed to the presenter not in-vision. Another of "News at Ten"'s most distinctive features from its start was the use of the chimes of Big Ben (commonly referred to as "the bongs"), with a succinct news headline being read between each "bong" in the opening sequence. Alastair Burnet became the newscaster most associated with "News at Ten" during its first couple of decades, and his "courtly manner and deferential interview style" became one of the hallmarks of the programme.

Absorption cross section is often highly dependent on neutron energy. Two of the most commonly specified measures are the cross-section for thermal neutron absorption, and resonance integral which considers the contribution of absorption peaks at certain neutron energies specific to a particular nuclide, usually above the thermal range, but encountered as neutron moderation slows the neutron down from an original high energy.

At age seventeen, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been interested in Freshman since age fourteen, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out. In 1929, the couple's son, Mike Todd, Jr., was born. The death of his father in 1931 was a turning point for Todd; he decided to change his name to Mike Todd on the day of his father's death. Todd's wife, Bertha, died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) on August 12, 1946 in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before Freshman's death, he had filed for divorce.
In the early 1977, on the 10th anniversary of Cybulski's fatal death, the band started to work on the third studio album, "Aktor" ("Actor"). The album was based on the previously known musical spectacle. The biggest hit from the album was "Muzyka w serca wstąpi nam". 2 Plus 1 toured with that repertoire not only in Poland, but also in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, where the album was released as "Herec". In the same year another song gained considerable popularity - "U kowala". In the middle of the 1977 2 Plus 1 recorded two songs in West Germany - "Ring Me Up" and "Free Me" and released them on a single.

The idea of building a new arena in Prague came on the heels of the "golden era" of Czech ice hockey: winning 3 gold medals in a row. The arena was proposed to be built in time to host the 2003 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, but due to unforeseen complications with the investors, the ice hockey governing body had to switch that tournament to Finland. The arena's main backer then became Sazka a.s., a Czech betting company.

In the UK the sweepstakes caused some strain in Anglo-Irish relations, and the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 was passed by the parliament of the UK to prevent export and import of lottery related materials. The United States Congress had outlawed the use of the US Postal Service for lottery purposes in 1890. A thriving black market sprang up for tickets in both jurisdictions.

The Queens Giant is situated north of the Long Island Expressway, west of the Cross-Island Parkway, hidden within a grove. The tree is just visible to westbound vehicles on the Expressway, but without going to the tree itself, the chances of knowing where to look are slight. The tree is near the Douglaston Plaza Mall, and is accessible by foot from Alley Pond Park. There are no signs to it, perhaps because many people want to keep it a secret and protect it from harm. One way to see it is with an Urban Park Ranger tour. The Queens Giant is surrounded by a metal fence on all sides to protect it. There is also a sign describing the tree. The tree is partially protected by a hill in front of it.
Early life.

Davis portrayed the conference in harsh terms, saying that Lincoln had demanded unconditional surrender and that the Confederacy must continue to fight. Some historians argue that Davis entered the Conference in bad faith in order to generate publicity around Northern hostility. Charles Sanders contends that Davis did not retain enough control over the negotiations to ensure they would serve his purpose, writing: "If Davis's motive, therefore, was to discredit the 'croakers,' he was running the enormous political risk that the negotiations might actually succeed." Sanders also argues that if Davis had intended to sabotage the Conference, he would not have considered such prominent representatives as Lee or Stephens. Stephens left Richmond and went home to Georgia on February 9.

The results of vowel contraction were complex from dialect to dialect. Such contractions occur in the inflection of a number of different noun and verb classes and are among the most difficult aspects of Ancient Greek grammar. They were particularly important in the large class of "contracted verbs", denominative verbs formed from nouns and adjectives ending in a vowel. (In fact, the reflex of contracted verbs in Modern Greek — i.e., the set of verbs derived from Ancient Greek contracted verbs—represents one of the two main classes of verbs in that language.)
The first extensive use of xylyl bromide was the firing by German forces of 18,000 "T-shells" at Russian positions in the Battle of Bolimów in January 1915. The shells were modified 15 cm (6 inch) artillery shells containing an explosive charge and c. 3 kg (7 lb) xylyl bromide. The attack was a complete failure because the winter weather was too cold to permit an effective aerosol, and the agent was either blown back towards the German lines, fell harmlessly to the ground, or was insufficiently concentrated to cause damage. A similar attack at Nieuwpoort in March 1915 was also unsuccessful. Nevertheless, because of its ease of manufacture xylyl bromide was widely used in World War I, in particular as a component of the Germans' Weisskreuz (white cross) mixture.

The town is surrounded by wooded hillsides and was the seat of the Dukes of Rohan from the 13th to 15th century. The old castle was destroyed in the building of new houses and many townhouses contain parts of chimney breasts, turret stones and gateway posts.
