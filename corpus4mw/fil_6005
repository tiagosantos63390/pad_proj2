He was born in Saint-André, Quebec, the son of Lifsey Dumont and Émilie Saint-Pierre, and was educated at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. In 1869, he was named a papal zouave at Rome. Dumont was a merchant at Kamouraska. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1877 after Charles-François Roy was elected to the House of Commons; his election was overturned in March of the following year. Dumont was married twice: to Cléophile Paradis in 1874 and to Marie-Eugénie Gagnon in 1889. He lived in the United States from 1882 to 1887. On his return, he became archivist for the Secretariat of Quebec, serving until 1909, when he was named deputy secretary for the province. In the same year, he was named a knight in the Order of St. Gregory the Great. Dumont died in Quebec City at the age of 64.

In 1934 he was a member of the Australian relay team which finished fourth in the 4×110 yards event. In the 100 yards competition he finished sixth and in the 220 yards contest he was eliminated in the semi-finals.
Similar in configuration to forced hot water baseboard—low profile units running along the base of a wall with a central heating element surrounded by radiating fins—electric baseboard heaters are inexpensive to produce and install. They offer instant heat and great reliability, but may be more or less cost-effective relative to other forms of heat depending on electricity prices.


The sample extrema can be used for a simple normality test, specifically of kurtosis: one computes the t-statistic of the sample maximum and minimum (subtracts sample mean and divides by the sample standard deviation), and if they are unusually large for the sample size (as per the three sigma rule and table therein, or more precisely a Student's t-distribution), then the kurtosis of the sample distribution deviates significantly from that of the normal distribution.
