History.
In early 1862, Lt. George T. Sinclair was sent to England, with orders to build a "clipper propellor for cruising purposes", and to take command of her when she was ready for sea. His instructions were to confer with Commander Bulloch in Liverpool, as to the design of the vessel, and the building, fitting out and arming of her. Bulloch received orders to help Sinclair with funds and advice. He showed Sinclair the drawings and specifications for the CSS Alabama, also the contract with Lairds, and they both decided to use these as a basis for the new cruiser.
