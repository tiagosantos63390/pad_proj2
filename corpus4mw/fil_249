Starting with the player on the dealer's left, each player lays one card face up in turn onto a personal discard pile, stating the cumulative value of the cards laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says "five", the next lays a six and says "eleven", and so on), without the total going above 31. Once no more cards can be played, the cumulative position is reset to zero and those players with cards remaining repeat the process until all players' cards have been played. Players score points during this process for making a total of fifteen; for reaching exactly, or as close as possible to, a total of thirty-one; for runs (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order) and for pairs. If a player cannot play without going over 31, he tells his opponent "Go", at which point the opponent lays down as many cards one at a time as possible, without going over 31. He scores one point for a go, unless he reaches 31 exactly. Reaching 31 exactly scores 2 points. Three or four of a kind are counted as multiple pairs: 3 of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points. 4 of a kind is 6 different kinds of pairs, or 12 points. If a player plays to get 15, s/he gets 2 points. Players choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their score; experienced players refer to this as either good or poor "pegsmanship". If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins.
According to Dr. Denis Burkitt, "Hiatus hernia has its maximum prevalence in economically developed communities in North America and Western EuropeÂ ... In contrast the disease is rare in situations typified by rural African communities." Burkitt attributes the disease to insufficient dietary fiber and the use of the unnatural sitting position for defecation. Both factors create the need for straining at stool, increasing intraabdominal pressure and pushing the stomach through the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm.
The accident and its associated publicity led to federal legislation to prevent similar "record" attempts by under-age pilots from taking place in the future. The legislation passed the House on September 11, 1996, and the Senate on September 18, 1996. On September 27, 1996, differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved. On October 9, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the "Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996", including the "Child Pilot Safety Act", into law. The statute prohibits anyone who does not hold at least a private pilot certificate and a current medical certificate from manipulating the controls of an aircraft, if that individual "is attempting to set a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or aeronautical feat."

The T-28 had significant flaws. The plungerspring type suspension was poor, but many of the better suspension designs used in World War II tanks had not yet been developed. The engine and transmission were troublesome. Worst of all, the design was not flexible. Although the T-28 and early versions of the Panzer IV were comparable in armour and firepower, the sound basic design of the Panzer IV allowed it to be significantly upgraded, while the T-28 was a poor basis for improvement.

In 1510, Agrippa studied briefly with Johannes Trithemius, and Agrippa sent him an early draft of his masterpiece, "De occulta philosophia libri tres", a kind of summa of early modern occult thought. Trithemius was guardedly approving, but suggested that Agrippa keep the work more or less secret; Agrippa chose not to publish, perhaps for this reason, but continued to revise and rethink the book for twenty years.
