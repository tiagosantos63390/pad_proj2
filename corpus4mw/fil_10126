The cemetery was used as the burial ground for the Jews of nearby Abterode ( until 1660 ), Reichensachsen ( until 1700 ) and Sontra ( until 1710 ), which all later established their own cemeteries, and also for Netra and Eschwege. The oldest of the surviving tombstones dates from 1642 and the last of them marked the grave of Salomon Kugelmann, who died on 11 April 1855 ( 23 Nisan 5615, according to the Jewish calendar ). Two years later, in 1857, the cemetery was closed when the Jews of Eschwege opened their own cemetery but it opened for one more time on 28 April 1861 ( 18 Iyar 5621, according to the Jewish calendar ) for the burial of the last remaining Jew of Jestädt, a penniless old man who had died childless at the age of 73.

On 6 June, Northern Baby started at 66/1 outsider for the 200th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He raced just behind the leader before turning into the straight in third place before moving up to dispute the lead with two furlongs left to run. He was quickly overtaken by Troy and Dickens Hill but stayed on to finish third, beaten seven lengths and three lengths. Northern Baby returned to England for one of Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age races, the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished third behind Dickens Hill and Crimson Beau. In August, the colt was dropped in class for the Group Three Prix de la Cote Normande at Deauville Racecourse in which he started second favourite behind Wolverton. Northern Baby won the race easily by two and a half lengths from Lord Zara, with Wolverton in fourth.

Galloo Island was mentioned by several different names in historical atlases and correspondence including: Isle au Galots, Galop, Gallou, Galos, Gallop, Galloup, Gallup, Gallop, Gallow, and Galloo.

Frønningen is an historic manor. It was sold in 1651 to a lecturer from Bergen, the magister Peder Nilssøn Lem, whose mother owned one of the neighboring farms. He then extended his properties in the area. Hans Sørensen Lem was the first of the family who moved here and actually lived on Frønningen, when he moved here about 1740. The estate was owned by the Lem family until 1889, when it was taken over by Bjarnhard Rumohr, who was a relative of the last Lem.

The tower is in perpendicular style, in three exterior visual stages separated by stringing. On different levels it has three interior floors consisting of the vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle floor levels are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal buttresses run up the bottom two stages and half of the top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west door, in a "segmental-pointed" arch with "broad chamfer" is in the lower exterior stage. The three-light window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an embattled parapet. The tower is floodlit at night.

The Balfour Note of 1 August 1922, signed by Britain's acting Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, was sent to Britain's debtors France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Portugal and Greece. Balfour claimed that the British government had reluctantly decided that the loans that those countries had received from HM Treasury should be paid back and that reparations from Germany should be collected due to the need for Britain to pay its creditors, the United States.
