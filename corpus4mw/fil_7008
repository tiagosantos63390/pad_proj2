The statue of the Aztec "god of flowers", Xochipilli, a 16th-century stone effigy unearthed on the side of the volcano Popocatépetl, depicts a single figure seated cross-legged upon a temple-like base; his body is covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms. Circular patterns on his kneecaps, right forearm, and headdress have been interpreted by R. Gordon Wasson as stylized fruit bodies of "Psilocybe aztecorum". Wasson says that the convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show the mushroom caps just before maturity. "P. aztecorum" is, in addition to "P. caerulescens", one of two mushrooms thought to be the species described by 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún as the "teonanácatl". The word "teonanácatl" () has been variously translated as "sacred or divine mushroom" or as "flesh of the gods". These mushrooms, considered holy sacraments by the Aztecs, were consumed during spiritual and divinatory rituals to induce hallucinatory visions.
