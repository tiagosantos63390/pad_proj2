The character was introduced to bring awareness for the homeless situation and people living in Skid row. Lloyd said: "I offered my insight more than research." On how he came up with it, Bradley Bell said: "Every day I drive into work, and I see all these homeless people who may have mental health issues like ADHD etc." Additionally, he said: "It feels like the show is where I want it to be. Weâ€™re bringing in a lot of reality to the show along with romance and some fantasy." Real homeless people were brought in to shoot scenes. Lloyd said that: "Brad is so hands-on with this storyline", having showed up to her audition, which not many producers do. She stated that she had experience with homeless people: "Another reason why this is great is because after I did missionary work in Indonesia last year, it led me to doing some work on Skid Row every Saturday."Lloyd noted that the character was completely different prior to her audition; but after seeing her, Bell based Dayzee around her.
