The war would not formally begin for another thirteen months. "The Three Power Alliance And The United States-Japanese War", written by Matsuo while he was serving as a liaison between the Japanese Foreign Office and the Admiralty, openly discussed the impending hostilities. He wrote, "...the United States will be obliged to exercise prudence and self- restraint toward Japan at least until 1945. As soon as the great armament expansion is completed ,the United States will probably avail herself of the opportunity to declare war upon Japan... then the chances of American victory will be far greater than Japan's". He stated, "Japan is naturally blessed by double defensive walls linked inside and outside by a chain of islands. The inside link consists of the Pescadores Islands, Formosa, all islands to the west and south, the Ogasawara Islands (Bonin), and the Chishima Islands, all of which have already been strongly armed for defense. The outside link (the Japanese South Pacific Mandate Islands) extends many thousands of nautical miles embracing the Marshalls, Carolines, Marianas and Pelew (sic) islands, which are scattered like stars across the routes of the United States Navy either perpendicularly or horizontally. The total number of these islands is more than one thousand. It will be impossible for the United States fleet to reach its destination..." Mr. Matsuo continued.
Filbert Street and 22nd Street in San Francisco are two of the steepest navigable streets in the Western Hemisphere, at a maximum gradient of 31.5% (17.5°). The steepest hill on Filbert is the east half of the block between Hyde and Leavenworth; like 22nd St it is one-way down. The city map shows a descent of 65 feet, which based on a half-block being 206.25 horizontal feet makes the grade 31.5%, the official figure. The sidewalk-only section of Broderick Street (between Broadway and Vallejo, where the city map shows a climb of 96 feet in the 275-foot block) is steeper, just under 35% grade, and a block west the sidewalk-only block of Baker Street is a bit steeper than that. An unofficial survey of San Francisco streets declared the steepest street in San Francisco to be a 30-foot section of Bradford Street , paved in 2010, with a 40% grade. Three streets in Los Angeles are steeper—28th Street in San Pedro at 33.3%, Eldred Street in Highland Park at 33%, and Baxter Street in Silver Lake at 32%.

The airship was finally commissioned on 6 November 1918, just before the armistice with Germany, after having spent four hours in the air. She set off again under the command of Squadron Leader Hincks for the airship base at East Fortune in Scotland. On the journey she encountered bad weather and it was feared that some of the plywood girders were failing, so she diverted to the airship base at Howden, East Riding of Yorkshire, for examination and repair. Unfortunately, the sheds had not been repaired since the "R27" had caught fire three months earlier and the roof in particular leaked badly. This caused the glue holding the plywood together to deteriorate; as a result, the airship became un-airworthy and beyond repair. In February 1919 she was dismantled. The covering was removed and returned to Cardington while the frames were sold for £200; these were broken up and sold for firewood but due to the fireproofing treatment they had received they would not burn.

On December 21, without warning, Thomas, the captain of the U.S. Navy destroyer, USS "Nathan James" (DDG-80), receives authenticated orders to carry out a nuclear strike on the Soviet city of Orel and its nearby ICBM silos. The nuclear tipped Tomahawks are fired off in an emotionless, automated manner. Over a period of hours they watch them make landfall on radar, and listen as the radio stations from Orel go off the air. With the mission complete, they report back to their superiors, and a reply from the U.S. Navy comes through, ordering them to break with general orders in this situation (operating under which they would proceed to the North Sea), but the message garbles to gibberish towards the end without telling them what their new orders are. With one exception later in the book, this is the last official communication from the U.S. Navy that the "Nathan James" ever receives.

The National Bolsheviks have accused Nashi of leading attacks on their members, including one in Moscow in August 2005. Liberal youth leader Ilya Yashin has also denounced Nashi as a cover for 'storm brigades' that will use violence against democratic organizations and claimed that their formation is only part of Putin's fear of losing power in a manner similar to the Orange Revolution of Ukraine. One young National Bolshevik, Roman Sadykhov, joined Nashi's sister organisation Rumol (Rus Molodaya, or Young Russia) in order to investigate its activities. He claimed that Rumol had formed a group of 'Ultras' to conduct street battles against members of the opposition. Their training included the construction of smoke bombs. He secretly taped meetings he had attended. At one of the meetings, senior Kremlin staffer Vladislav Surkov said that he found the training for street combat 'terrifically interesting'.
