Reception.
"Alternative Press" awarded the album 4.5/5 and Scott Heisel praised the improvement of the album over its predecessor; ""Riot!" was ridiculously top-loaded, with an unmemorable second half. "Eyes" astonishes from start to finish, with the bouncy and confessional "Looking Up" and the immensely powerful track "All I Wanted" showing up as diamonds in an already gem-covered rough". Sarah Bee, journalist for the BBC gave a largely favorable review and summarized, "If you didn't like Paramore before, their third album is unlikely to sway you. They make the kind of forceful, commercial emo-pop that music lovers love to hate. However, as forceful, commercial emo-pop goes – and it does – "Brand New Eyes" is very good. It is brash and gauche, but charming."
