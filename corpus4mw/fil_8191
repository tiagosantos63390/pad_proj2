The minimalistic form and low material costs as well as the ergonomic design of the garden furniture resulted in the Werkbund’s prize, called “Die gute Form” (the good shape). The creative possibilities of the new Eternit material led to the advertisement of a competition on garden furniture and plant containers, which was organized by the exhibition directors with collaboration from the German enterprise Eternit AG. Contemporarily shaped stools, pots and troughs were designed as a result of this competition.

In essence, it tests to see the source of the raised ACTH levels in a patient with diagnosed Cushing's syndrome and high or normal serum ACTH levels. The inferior petrosal sinus is where the pituitary gland drains. Therefore, a sample from here showing raised ACTH compared to the periphery suggests that it is a pituitary cause of Cushing's, i.e. Cushing's disease. Equivocal levels of ACTH indicate ectopic or Paraneoplastic Cushing's Syndrome. The sample is usually taken after administration of Corticotropin-releasing hormone or, more recently, DDAVP, which have been shown to increase ACTH production in active ACTH-producing pituitary tumors. Increasingly, it is known as a gold-standard method for diagnosing Cushing's disease.

Following impressive performances with the youth teams, Abrashi was first called up to the reserve side towards the end of the 2006–07 season, making his debut on 16 May 2007 in a goalless draw against GC Biaschesi, coming on in the 81st minute for Micha Iseli. 10 days later he was in the starting formation for the 3-2 away win against FC Chur 97. The following season he started in the youth team, but was promoted permanently a few months into the season and on 11 November 2007 he came on as a late substitute in a 4-3 loss against FC St. Gallen II. The following game he started in midfield against FC Herisau in a game which ended in a 4-1 win, and where Abrashi scored his first competitive goal in the 90th minute of the game. He became a regular in the squad's starting line up for the second half of the season, even scoring again against FC Baden. His performances in the reserve side caught the attention of the first team coach Mathias Walther, who included the 18 year old in his squad for the Challenge League class against FC La Chaux-de-Fonds on 27 April 2008. Abrashi came on as a 67th minute substitute for fellow Ethnic Albanian Sehar Fejzulahi in the 1-0 away loss. He made 2 more appearances off the bench for the senior side against FC Lugano and SR Delémont respectively.
