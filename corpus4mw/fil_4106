Later the name was changed into LSK - Loznički Sportski Klub and was the direct predecessor of today's FK Loznica. During this period the club didn't played in any organized competitions, only friendly matches against other clubs from the neighboring towns of Zvornik, Bijeljina, Šabac or Valjevo. These matches were played on Sundays and many people usually came to attend, specially the local youth that loudly cheered for their club.
