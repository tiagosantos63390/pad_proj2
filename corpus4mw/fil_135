The origin of Centreville's name is a seemingly simple one. The town's official website provides some insight on how the name came to be. "In 1782, an Act of the Assembly authorized the removal of the county seat from Queenstown, Maryland to a more central part of the county. Thatâ€™s why the town was named "Centre Ville", with French spelling because of the post-Revolutionary War admiration for the French."
