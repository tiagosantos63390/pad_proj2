In September 2001 during the annual Banjo Jubilee jazz festival Tagawa was awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award" by "Banjos Unlimited"—a nonprofit association of banjo bands and individual banjo players dedicated to the preservation of the banjo and its music. And again that day Tagawa was further acknowledged as the 2001 Jubilee Honoree for his contributions to the Peninsula Banjo Band. Lastly, arguably one of the proudest moments in the life of a music teacher, twelve of Tagawa's former students attended the festival for a reunion performance. Former band members from the entire thirteen-year span attended. Many had not touched their instruments since the 1970s or 80s and one would think that it would be difficult to play even for just one performance. Due largely to Tagawa's adaptation of the Suzuki method for instruction to play the banjo, in a practice session the day before their performance, the group synchronized their playing within the span one song. What was more amazing was the fact that some of these former students had never performed together, previously having joined and left the band before later members.

Exercise Verity was a 1949 multilateral naval training exercise involving 60 warships from the British, French, and Dutch navies for the newly formed Western Union, the precursor to the Western European Union (WEU). A contemporary newsreel described this exercise as involving "the greatest assembly of warships since the Battle of Jutland."
"Implacable" hauled "Centaur" off. The battle had cost "Centaur" three killed and 27 wounded. "Vsevolod", which had received about 100 men as reinforcements after her initial battle with "Implacable", lost another 124 men killed and wounded in the battle with "Centaur"; 56 Russians swam ashore and so escaped being taken prisoner.

She explains her interest in this popular cooking show by her interest in transmitting her cooking skills via television.
