There is an important difference between biodegradability and biobased content. A bioplastic such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) can be 100% biobased (i.e. contain 100% renewable carbon), yet be non-biodegradable.

The biobased component of these bioplastics is considered carbon-neutral since their origin is from biomass.
