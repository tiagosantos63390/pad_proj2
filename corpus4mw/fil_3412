After Guam was added to the North American Numbering Plan, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulated calls to and from Guam as "domestic", hence dramatically lowered the cost of these telephone calls. This change also opened up national toll-free numbers (currently area codes 800, 888, 877, 866, 855 and 844) to callers from Guam, which became very popular with the advent of pre-paid phone cards.
The show first aired in the United States on the network on February 3, 2007 to an audience of exactly 4.7 million viewers. Viacom announced, it "delivered Nickelodeon's highest-rated premiere in seven years" and instantly became one of the most favorable for children aged 6â€“11. According to an article by TV reporter Jacques Steinberg, of "The New York Times", the series' popularity is equivalent to "Hannah Montana" and "Cory in the House". Three seasons aired and concluded unexpectedly on June 13, 2009 due to the network placing high demands on the family that would disrupt the siblings' schooling. The series earned 1 Broadcast Music, Inc. Cable Award; 2 Writers Guild Award nominations, winning one WGA; 3 Young Artist Award nominations; and was nominated for 1 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award (both in the United States and United Kingdom).
