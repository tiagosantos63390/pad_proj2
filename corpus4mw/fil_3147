While doing their homeworks outside, a young Zabala was distracted by a young Adoro and a young Marasigan shaking a tree branch; while a young Buendia tried to keep focus in writing what believed to be the song. However, the four boys eventually tossed up the papers in the air and simply enjoyed their time outdoors. The video then cuts to the young girl looking at a pair of caged love birds, before holding on the railings of her window; an allusion that conveys her real situation.

After the First World War had ended, Captain J. Rigden assumed the role of Secretary and served until 1926 when he was replaced by much revered Stanley Brown.
Hazrat Khwaja Al Mawdud Chisti became the mureed of Hazrat Khwaja Nasir Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan Chisti. After he became a mureed, his murshid (Master) addressed him by saying, "O Qutubuddin Mowdud, adopt the path of the Faqr." The word "faqr" is literally translated as "poverty", but in the language of tasawwuf, it means to be rich with Allah. It is for one to have total trust in Allah and not to be dependent on any other than Allah. Faqar is the way of true dervishes. Khwaja Mawdud Al Chisti accepted his murshids (spiritual guidance) advice. Shortly thereafter he went into seclusion and remained absorbed in worship for twenty years. During this period, he rarely ate and was reported to complete two recitations of the Quran during the day and two during the night. He also used to constantly make the zikr of La Ilaha Illallah. Due to his consistent worship, everything in the universe became apparent to him, and nothing was kept hidden.
