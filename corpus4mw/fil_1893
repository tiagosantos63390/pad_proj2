Some athletes choose to sit in a sauna so that they can sweat without wasting energy. Another technique is to chew gum to induce salivation, then to spit out the saliva instead of swallowing it. 
During the Complex Off-design calculation, the operating point on the compressor map is constantly being guessed (in terms of formula_92 and formula_93) to obtain an estimate of the compressor mass flow, pressure ratio and efficiency. After the combustion calculation is completed, the implied compressor mechanical shaft speed is used to estimate the turbine corrected speed (i.e. formula_103). Typically, the turbine load (power demanded) and entry flow and temperature are used to estimate the turbine enthalpy drop/inlet temperature (i.e. formula_104). The estimated turbine corrected speed and enthalpy drop/inlet temperature parameters are used to obtain, from the turbine map, an estimate of the turbine corrected flow (formula_100)

The mitigation initiatives that a community develops must have their basis in the community’s guiding principles on hazard mitigation. The initiatives must also actively reduce a community’s vulnerability to hazards. This can be justified through the vulnerability assessment section of the strategy. Finally, mitigation initiatives must accurately reflect the community’s needs. The working group assigned to develop the strategy can help assure that local needs are incorporated in the mitigation initiatives. These steps prevent projects that have no basis in a community’s overall vision of hazard mitigation, or in its vulnerability to hazards on the vulnerability assessment, from being proposed.
Agent Liberty's real name is Benjamin Lockwood. He once worked for the CIA but ultimately left in disgust with their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake. He later became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the Sons Of Liberty, who outfitted him with the costume and weaponry he uses as Agent Liberty. In the beginning, Lockwood used his Agent Liberty guise to help the Sons' stated cause of overturning the current governmental regime, which brought him into conflict with Superman; however, when the Sons' leadership asked him to perform an assassination of politician Pete Ross, Lockwood refused, and left the Sons to go solo. During his time working with the Sons, Agent Liberty also briefly assisted the Justice League against the villain Brainiac in the crossover Panic in the Sky.

Bieser appeared in 47 games with the Mets that year, chiefly as a bench player. His left-handed bat, above-average foot speed, and ability to play multiple positions helped him stay on the roster for a large portion of the season, as these traits afforded manager Bobby Valentine an unusual variety of tactical options. As a further testament to his versatility as a player, Bieser also filled in as a pitcher in minor league games during at least six different seasons [http://204.27.188.70/daily/05-96/05-24-96/d02sp110.htm.
