During the 19th century, the farms began to change from growing grain to raising dairy cattle. By 1856 there were enough dairy farmers for a dairy to open in Alchenflüh. A warehouse was built two years later in 1858. The Burgdorf-Solothurn railroad opened a station in the municipality in 1876. The municipality grew slowly until 1965, when the A1 motorway was built between the two villages. The motorway brought new businesses and commuters to the municipality. Three new housing developments were built to house to growing population. New school buildings were built in 1969-70, 1989 and in 2006 and a kindergarten opened in 1987-88. Before the 1960s there was some industry in the municipality, including a gravel quarry and a printing factory. These were joined after 1969 by a machine factory, a distribution center for Emmi Käse AG, a regional potato storage station, and the Conforama and Pfister furniture factories. The Lyssach-Alchenflüh shopping center was built along the motorway and is shared between the two communities. A proposed merger with Kirchberg was rejected by the latter in a vote in 1973.

The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a Bronze Age settlement and an overlying Roman estate from the 1st to 3rd century at Steiacher. An additional Roman village was found in Mullen village. Copper and bronze waste and fragments from a foundry have been found at Riedernacker, though it is impossible to determine the age of the scrap. The village was originally part of the "Herrschaft" of Erlach. In 1474 all of the Erlach lands were acquired by Bern and Tschugg became part of the Bernese court of Ins. The major landholder in the village was a local noble family, the Berseth family. Their manor house was first mentioned in 1358 along with its attached vineyards. By the 16th century the Berseths were citizens of Bern. In 1678 the Steiger family acquired the Berseth estate and the village. In the following century, they rebuilt the house into a grand country manor house, which came to be known as the "Landsitz" Steiger. During the 19th century, the Canton of Bern bought the manor house. In 1889, it was converted into the Bethesda Hospital, a clinic for neurological rehabilitation.

Unintentional small jumps are ubiquitous to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue is slightly elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, no matter how slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch in front of the cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and it is clear that the coin is being jumped.
