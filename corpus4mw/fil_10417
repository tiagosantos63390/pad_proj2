The novel was shortlisted for the 2006 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Fiction. When Straight won the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction in 2007, the Lannan Foundation said "A Million Nightingales" "continues her singularly beautiful exploration of race in America."
Editors of "KoreAm" reported that Korean-American adoptees would be able to see a reflection of themselves in the pilot. In a retrospective review of the show, Amid Amidi of the animation entertainment blog "Cartoon Brew" wrote that, relative to pilots produced by the network, "Kitty Bobo" had "some potential". He regarded its color styling and "appealing design" to be most memorable, while recalling it to have "decent storytelling" as well. Also writing retrospectively, Adam Finley of AOL TV, stated that, while "not side-splitting by any means," the pilot contained a few comedic elements. He praised the art style, contrasting it other Cartoon Network programming. He ultimately opined that the short did not deserve to win, but that it would provide "a little more variety in style" for the network.
