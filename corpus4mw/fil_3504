Conifer's Spirit Rock is painted on a regular basis. This is a means to reflect school spirit. Conifer has had 2 rocks after their first was destroyed, by a rival Evergreen High School student at that time. The spirit rock is frequently repainted for special school sporting events, awareness months, or to celebrate seniority at the school.

Lifty & Shifty are two green villianous raccoon twin brothers who frequently steal merchandise from the other Happy Tree Friends (thus their names), as well as treasure hunting, ransacking houses or anything to get rich quick. They mostly steal from Lumpy (in "Meat Me for Lunch" they stole meat from Lumpy's deli mart, in "Milkin' It" they stole a cow from Lumpy's farm, in "Concrete Solution" they stole his wallet, and in "Junk in the Trunk" they abducted his pet elephant). They probably rob Lumpy so frequently because his lack of intelligence and common sense makes him an easy target.
