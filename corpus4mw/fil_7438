The first Royal Australian Air Force air vice marshal was Richard Williams in 1935; he was followed by Stanley Goble—Williams' successor all three times he held the position of Chief of the Air Staff—two years later. Among the Royal Australian Air Force officers to hold this rank is Frank Hubert McNamara, the first Australian aviator to be decorated with the Victoria Cross. McNamara was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1917 during the First World War while serving with the Australian Flying Corps, the Australian Army's air branch and predecessor of the Royal Australian Air Force; he was made an air vice marshal in 1942. Currently, only two women have reached air vice marshal rank: Julie Hammer, the first female to obtain one-star rank in the Australian Defence Force on promotion to air commodore in 1999, was the first to achieve two-star rank when advanced to air vice marshal in 2003; Margaret Staib was promoted in 2010 on appointment as Commander Joint Logistics.
