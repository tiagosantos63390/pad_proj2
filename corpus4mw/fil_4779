Though seen only briefly in flashbacks in the manga in "Class Period 18", and Chapter 60, Nogita made a somewhat more prominent appearance in the anime episode equivalent to that chapter, "Class Period 8: Hug Me Tightly", where she was first referred to by name. There, she was revealed to have been an extremely diligent instructor who was close to her students and had been a teacher at Futatsubashi Elementary School until the previous year, having apparently retired after getting married onstage in a glamorous wedding. She was something of a rival for Sae Shirai, with whom she disagreed with on many issues, and offered some friendly advice and encouragement to her successor, Daisuke Aoki, in regards to appropriate levels of physical contact between teachers and students.
