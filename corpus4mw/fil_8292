Charlie Chaplin's silent film "The Gold Rush" (1925), the highest grossing silent comedy, was set in the Klondike, as was the silent epic "The Trail of '98" (1928) and Mae West's "Klondike Annie" (1936). A silent-era film by Russian director Lev Kuleshov "By the Law" (1926), based on Jack London's story "The Unexpected" also dramatizes the life of the gold-seekers.
Early life.
International Street is a themed area at Canada's Wonderland theme park in Vaughan, Ontario. Similar to the Main Street, U.S.A. sections of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, it acts as an entrance way to the park. The street ends at Wonder Mountain, a visual landmark for navigating through much of the park. A similar format is used in Kings Island and Kings Dominion theme parks. In each instance, the International Street section was created while the park was owned by Kings Entertainment Company, then transferred to Paramount Parks, and finally to the current owners, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.

By the 1950s, plans were underway for a larger building for the Fairview branch, which, since the opening at its second location on Pico Boulevard in 1942, had grown tremendously. In 1956, the third Fairview branch at 2101 Ocean Park Boulevard opened to the public.
