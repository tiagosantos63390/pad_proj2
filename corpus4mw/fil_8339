The John Ford Home (also known as Ford Stockade or Ford's Fort) is a historic landmark located in Marion County, Mississippi, approximately 20 miles south of the city of Columbia, near the community of Sandy Hook. Built in 1809 by an early settler of the area, Reverend John Ford, the home is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places as an example of an "elevated frontier-style" structure that was common at the time in the Mississippi Valley along the Pearl River. The home is currently preserved by the Marion County Historical Society, and is available for public view.
