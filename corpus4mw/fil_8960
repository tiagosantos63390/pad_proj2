Other critics were not as impressed. Peter Keough of "The Boston Phoenix" gave the film 1 1/2 out of 4 stars, comparing the film unfavorably to "The Puffy Chair" and writing that "Alex Ross Perry's self-consciously coy indulgence reminds me of the work of Diablo Cody, but slighter and more irritating." Shawn Levy of "The Oregonian" complained about the film's style, writing: "There’s handmade and then there’s amateurish. This, alas, is the latter." David Fear of "Time Out New York" gave the film a negative review, writing that "Some will call "The Color Wheel" daring. Others will remember that it takes more than desperate shocks to add substance to the sloppy diddlings of a dilettante."
