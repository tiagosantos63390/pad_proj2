The livery often had rented horses to Iowa City firemen to pull their flashy pumper and hose reel fire wagons. These rigs were being housed across Washington Street in the 1881 City Hall, which featured a tall ornamental clocked-belfry. There was no provision for stabling horses in City Hall, although a widely heralded matched pair of white Percherons named "Snowball" and "Highball" were stabled in a fire substation along the east face of Linn Street north of Market Street. The old City Hall bell now is displayed a block from the Englert in semi-operating condition in the entryway of the city parking ramp along Linn Street adjacent to the Iowa City-Johnson County Senior Center.
