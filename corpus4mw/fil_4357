In 1956, Comiskey became co-general manager along with his brother-in-law Johnny Rigney, replacing Frank Lane. His mother died later that year, and in her will control of the team was split between Comiskey and his older sister, Dorothy. Comiskey received a 46 percent stake, making him the team's second largest shareholder. However, he felt the team was his birthright and spent the next two years trying to wrest control of the team from his sister. After a lengthy court battle, Dorothy opted to sell the team to Comiskey after the 1958 season. Believing that Dorothy wouldn't consider any offers from outside the family, Comiskey made a fairly low offer. Dorothy, in a fit of pique, instead sold her 54 percent stake to a group headed by Bill Veeck. However, Comiskey refused to sell his interest and remained as the team's largest single shareholder. This forced Veeck to incur over a million dollars in additional taxes.
The Ausper was a racing car made in Great Britain from 1960 to 1962 by Competition Cars of Australia. It started life as a normal Formula Junior car, with a rear-mounted Cosworth engine set in a tubular space frame, with a Renault gearbox. Originally, it was based on the Tomahawk, a design from Australian Tom Hawkes that was intended for export to his home country. One of the unusual features of the Ausper was the bodywork, which was very low, with an upswept tail and the drivers roll bar faired into the headrest.
