Borbón played on the 1995 Atlanta Braves, who won the World Series that year. Pedro pitched one important inning in the 1995 World Series. The Braves were leading two games to one over the Cleveland Indians, and were leading the fourth game going into the ninth inning. However, Braves' closer Mark Wohlers was shaky after having pitched two and two-thirds innings the previous day. Wohlers allowed the Indians to score a run and put a runner on second in that ninth inning without recording any outs. Borbón then came in to relieve Wohlers, and promptly struck out Jim Thome and Sandy Alomar, Jr. while getting Kenny Lofton to fly out to right.
