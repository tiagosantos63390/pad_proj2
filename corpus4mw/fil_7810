More importantly, on 13 May was part of the squadron that was present at the surrender of Naples during the Neapolitan War, though she herself was not actually there. A British squadron, consisting of "Grasshopper", the 74-gun , the frigate "Alcmene", and the sloop blockaded the port and destroyed all the gunboats there. Parliament voted a grant of £150,000 to the officers and men of the squadron for the property captured at the time, the grant being paid in 1816. Initially, "Grasshopper" was excluded from the payment as she was not actually present, having been sent on an errand. However, Sir Charles Barrard sued and eventually the court agreed that there had been a blockade and that "Grasshopper" had been part of the blockade and so was entitled to share in the grant. The money was paid in May 1819, with the other officers and crew of the other three vessels being required to repay part of their grant.

Peter Debruge of "Variety" gave the film a positive review, saying "While not quite as charming or unique as the original, "Despicable Me 2" comes awfully close, extending co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin's delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe." Peter Hartlaub of the "San Francisco Chronicle" gave the film three out of four stars, saying "It's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment, that it takes time to realize there's no cohesive story, zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater."
