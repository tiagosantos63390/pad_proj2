Chakra does not schedule releases for specific dates but uses a "Half-Rolling release" system. This means that the core packages of Chakra (graphics, audio, etc.) are frozen and only updated to fix any security problems. These packages are updated after the latest versions have been thoroughly tested before being moved to permanent repository (about every six months). This allows stable base to ensure stability to the rest of the programs. The other applications (web browsers, games, media players, office suites, etc.) are updated following the rolling release model and are generally available immediately after their release.
