Some urban Romantic villas remain in Avenida Mouzinho de Albuquerque and other streets in the urban core. Quinta de Beiriz is a Romantic estate idealized by Alfredo de Almeida Brandão, a diplomat and a fine-arts lover. The estate includes gardens, lakes and a wooded park, fountains and mythical statuary. The small palace of the estate was built in the beginning of the 20th century, but several constructions are from the 18th century. It includes D. Hilda Chapel, which mimics Minho region sanctuaries from the 16th and 17th centuries, and living rooms with Portuguese-style Baroque woodcarvings. The azulejos used on the exterior walls of the palace include hunting and countryside motifs.
