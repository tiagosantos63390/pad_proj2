The Robinson Mine is a porphyry copper deposit located in the Robinson Mining District, adjacent to Ruth in White Pine County, Nevada. Large-scale copper mining began in the district in 1907 and, with some hiatuses and several changes of ownership, continues in 2012. Production from 1908 to 1978 was more than 4 billion pounds (1,500,000 tonnes) of copper and 2,700,000 troy ounces (84 t) of gold, and current annual production averages around 120 million pounds of copper and 75,000 ounces of gold. A 1992 feasibility study found a potential 16 year mine life at these production rates; since then, there have been about 9 years of full production. Published ore reserves at Robinson as of January 1, 2008, were 103 million tons containing 0.68% copper and 0.23 gm/t gold.
