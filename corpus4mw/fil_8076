Tate originally guest-starred in the seventh season finale episode, "Search Committee". While she was initially the top choice to join the cast as the Manager, she was unable to join the series, due to her commitment to the West End production of the Shakespeare play, "Much Ado About Nothing". However, on October 21, 2011, it was announced that she would be returning to "The Office" in order to reprise her role of Nellie, who has been hired as the "Misguided special projects manager". It was noted that she will strike up a "Far from professional" relationship with current Sabre CEO, Robert California. Tate was originally to be featured in only a six episode arc, before being extended to the status of a series regular.
