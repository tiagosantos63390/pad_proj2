Majete Wildlife Reserve is a national game reserve in Malawi. The reserve lies a few miles north of Chikwawa, with the Shire River forming its eastern boundary. The park consists of approximately 70,000 hectares of land and contains about 4,000 animals, including elephant, eland, zebra, leopard, baboons, many species of monkeys, and warthogs. Large numbers of hippos and crocodiles can be found in streams and along the banks of the Shire River. In the 1980s, Majete suffered from poaching and deforestation. The elephant herds that used to be common in the area have largely vanished. Many animals have been re-introduced, including lions, black rhinos, and leopards. The park is now protected by a 142 km fence and may be the best place in Malawi to see the Big 5 animals. Majete is very dry and hot in the summer, and several man-made watering holes have been constructed to maintain the wildlife population.

Hanson founded the RAHCO Company to build self-leveling mechanisms and since then, RAHCO of Spokane, Washington has grown into a world leader in the design and production of custom commercial machinery systems. RAHCO estimates that automatic leveling has saved at least three percent of grain harvested on lands where combine leveling is needed, which is worth millions of dollars each year.
