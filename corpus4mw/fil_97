The writers were inspired by a variety of sources, including sources inside government, published material and contemporary news stories. The writers also met several leading senior civil servants under the auspices of the Royal Institute of Public Administration, a think-tank for the public service sector, which led to the development of some plot lines. Some situations were conceived as fiction, but were later revealed to have real-life counterparts. The episode "The Compassionate Society" depicts a hospital with five hundred administrative staff but no doctors, nurses or patients. Lynn recalls that "after inventing this absurdity, we discovered there were six such hospitals (or very large empty wings of hospitals) exactly as we had described them in our episode."
The earliest recording method for television was telerecording, which involved recording the image from a special television monitor onto film with a modified film camera. Early examples made by this method include the first two episodes of "The Quatermass Experiment" (1953), transmitted live while simultaneously telerecorded. The visual quality of the second episode's recording was considered so poor - a fly entered the gap between the camera and monitor at one point - that the remainder of the series was not recorded.

The United States possessed a clear advantage in the early decades of international play (though they were defeated by Argentina in the First FIBA World Championships in 1950). The US men were dominant from the first Olympic tournament to hold basketball, held in Berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the gold, and joined by continental neighbors Canada and Mexico on the medal platform. Through the next six tournaments, the United States went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a single contest in the games held in London, Helsinki, Melbourne, Rome, Tokyo, and Mexico City. Participation in these tournaments were limited to amateurs, but the US teams during this period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional basketball, including all-time greats Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Jerry Lucas; the latter three competed on the 1960 Rome team often credited as the best U.S. roster until the formation of the 1992 Dream Team.

In 1956, Blue Note employed Reid Miles, an artist who worked for "Esquire" magazine. The cover art produced by Miles, often featuring Wolff's photographs of musicians in the studio, was as influential in the world of graphic design as the music within would be in the world of jazz. Under Miles, Blue Note was known for their striking and unusual album cover designs. Miles' graphical design was distinguished by its tinted black and white photographs, creative use of sans-serif typefaces, and restricted color palette (often black and white with a single color), and frequent use of solid rectangular bands of color or white, influenced by the Bauhaus school of design.

The First Lantern is a mysterious being that stirs within imprisonment. The First Lantern was given the unknown power by the Guardians of the Universe, and is sealed in the Chamber of Shadows for billions of years. The Guardians (who have become unemotional) arrive to the Chamber of Shadows to pull the First Lantern; he is able to recognize the Guardians, demanding to be let out. The Guardians arrive on Earth and used the power of the First Lantern to create the Third Army to replace the Green Lantern Corps. The imprisoned First Lantern tells them that they will regret that and that he will escape. The Third Army spread over the universe destroying all life and free will, so they told the First Lantern once the Third Army completes their control over the whole universe, there will be no need for him. The First Lantern tries to reason with the Guardians to no avail. Meanwhile, Black Hand reanimated the elder Oan (who was killed by the Guardians) for information about where the Guardians have put him in, but he is only told that the First Lantern is a danger of the universe. When the Guardians realize they cannot completely control the universe and need more of the Third Army, they use more of the power of the First Lantern, without realizing that the First Lantern's prison is breaking. It is revealed that the identity of the First Lantern was Volthoom (a monk who created the ring for Power Ring, Green Lantern's arch-enemy and doppelgänger). While Hal Jordan and Sinestro are trapped in the Dead Zone, until they encounter Tomar-Re (who was undead in the Dead Zone) telling them to stop Volthoom, before he goes about bringing changes to reality in history. Tomar-Re explains to them that Volthoom was a mysterious explorer from an unknown time of the future, who went back just in time at the beginning of Krona's observing of the origins of the universe, where Volthoom has unlocked and becomes the power of the Emotional spectrum of the creation of the first light powers known as the First Lantern. Very early at that time, the Guardians brought the idea of sharing this power, but Volthoom dismayed them and he began killing millions of beings in the universe.

Filippo Brunelleschi (; 1377 – April 15, 1446) was one of the foremost architects and engineers of the Italian Renaissance. He is perhaps most famous for his development of linear perspective and for engineering the dome of the Florence Cathedral, but his accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering and even ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy.
The practice of appointed Queen's Counsel continues in a number of Canada's provinces based on merit, usually after decades of community service and advocacy, as a way of recognising members who have helped community members, charities, environmental groups and others in need of legal aid.

Xipe Totec connected agricultural renewal with warfare. He flayed himself to give food to humanity, symbolic of the way maize seeds lose their outer layer before germination and of snakes shedding their skin. Without his skin, he was depicted as a golden god. Xipe Totec was believed by the Aztecs to be the god that invented war. His insignia included the pointed cap and rattle staff, which was the war attire for the Mexica emperor. He had a temple called Yopico within the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan.

Second, in modern Latter-day Saint vernacular, "outer darkness" usually refers to an eternal state of punishment. Mortals who during their lifetime become sons of perdition—those who commit the unpardonable sin—will be consigned to outer darkness. It is taught that the unpardonable sin is committed by those who "denthe Son after the Father has revealed him". However, the vast majority of residents of outer darkness will be the "devil and his angels ... the third part of the hosts of heaven" who in the pre-existence followed Lucifer and never received a mortal body. The residents of outer darkness who received a mortal body, while being resurrected like the rest of mankind, are the only children of God that will not receive one of three kingdoms of glory at the Last Judgment, remaining in that state of suffering for their own sins, for eternity. This state shares some similarities with certain Christian views of hell. On this subject, Joseph Smith taught that those who commit the unpardonable sin are "doomed to "Gnolaum"—to dwell in hell, worlds without end." The word "gnolaum" is used elsewhere by Smith to mean "eternal" (in the sense of 'everlasting' or 'forever' with perpetuity in time, and likely not "eternal" as 'outside of time' or having no relationship with the temporality). It is believed by Latter-day Saints that very few people who have lived on the earth will be consigned to this state, but Latter-day Saint scripture suggests that at least Cain will be present.

Prior to the arrival of European settlers around 1740, Greenbrier County, like most of West Virginia, was used as a hunting grounds by the Shawnee and Cherokee Nations. This land, which they called Can-tuc-kee, was thought to be inhabited by ghosts of Azgens, a white people from an eastern sea who were said to be killed off by the Shawnee's ancestors. According to the legend, the area was owned by the bones and ghosts of the Azgens, who would permit responsible hunting but, according to Black Fish, "we are never allowed to kill the game wantonly, and we are forbidden to settle in the country...if we did, these ghosts would rise from their caves and mounds and slay us, but they would set father against son and son against father and neighbor against neighbor and make them kill one another." Thus, while hunting parties were permitted to camp and exploit the area, permanent settlements east and south of the Spay-lay-we-theepi (Ohio River) were forbidden.

Cockburn was married from 1969 to 1980 and has a daughter from that marriage. He wrote the song "Little Seahorse", released on "In the Falling Dark", in late 1975 about the time when his daughter was "in utero".
Andrey Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt Vera's village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school newspaper. While a teenager, he designed "perpetual motion machines", concealing their (necessary) defects so cleverly that his secondary-school teachers could not discover them. In 1910, his aunt adopted him, and they moved to Moscow, where he graduated from high school in 1920. Later that same year, Kolmogorov began to study at the Moscow State University and the Chemistry Technological Institute.

For several decades throughout the mid-20th century, the state of Virginia authorized compulsory sterilization of the mentally retarded for the purpose of eugenics. The operations were carried out at the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, now known as the Central Virginia Training School, located just outside Lynchburg in Madison Heights. An estimated 8,300 Virginians were sterilized and relocated to Lynchburg, known as a "dumping ground" of sorts for the feeble-minded, poor, blind, epilectic, and those otherwise seen as genetically "unfit".
