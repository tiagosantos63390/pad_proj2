As a special honor, Ashikaga Yoshiharu gave permission for Harumune to use one ideograph ("haru-") of his name. 

In Bujold's next published novel, "The Warrior's Apprentice" Miles and Elena both appear as teenagers 17 years after the events in "Barrayar".
Upon arrival, the boys are introduced to Dr. Mallard (Kenneth MacDonald, in his debut appearance with the Stooges) who prescribes a detailed, regimented schedule of exercise, only to be fed a "nice bowl of milk" for breakfast and lunch. Mallard then assigns two nurses to train the Stooges, which sends the boys head over heels into fits of love — until the nurses turn out to be men (Cy Schindell and Rocky Woods).
