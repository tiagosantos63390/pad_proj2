He is possibly best remembered of all his Philip Morris related-work for the "I Love Lucy" show. In 1951, in the early days of commercial broadcast television in the United States, the new comedy show ran into difficulties when it first sought sponsorship. This was due to the Cuban character played by Desi Arnaz. Advertisers were fearful of unknown public acceptance of the show featuring a marriage of mixed ethnicity in that era. After failing to win financial backing from CBS executives, Arnaz traveled to New York to hawk the show, and struck a deal with advertising mogul Milton Biow who bought the show for his client, Philip Morris cigarettes. The tobacco company sponsored "I Love Lucy" exclusively from its premiere on October 15, 1951, through Christmas of 1954 (it then shifted to an "alternate sponsorship" with Procter & Gamble until June 1955). Although Philip Morris had a rich return for its investment and risk-taking in backing "I Love Lucy", Arnaz also had the wisdom to retain ownership of the "I Love Lucy" shows, effectively inventing both the "rerun" and syndication procedures for the fledgling television industry.

Ógra Shinn Féin (the youth wing of political party Sinn Féin), which maintains fraternal relations with Segi, has called for the "immediate release of our comrades in Euskal Herria". It has begun an online petition to demand the reversal of the decision to declare Segi to be an illegal and terrorist organization.
