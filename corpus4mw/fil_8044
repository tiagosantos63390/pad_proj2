The wide-band nature of waffle-iron filters finds applications in satellite communications. A satellite earth station may have multiple diplexers connected to a multi-band antenna feeder. Each diplexer delivers a wide-band signal in a different band and it is essential that its signal does not contain out-of-band components, particularly harmonics. These can seriously interfere with, or even stop entirely, communication in another band. The diplexer must therefore have a stopband that is even wider than the passband. For this reason, as well as the other advantages of waffle-irons, these diplexers are commonly made to a waffle-iron design.Manuilov "et al.", 2009, p.526</ref>
