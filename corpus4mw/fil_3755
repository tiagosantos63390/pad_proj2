Those who were officers of the society included: the Earl of Carlisle (President 1858-1859); the Earl of Ellesmere (President from 1859); Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe (President in 1871); the Duke of Manchester (President in 1873); George Charles Haité (Vice-President since 1881); and the Lord Mayor of London (Vice-President in 1882).
A westward-moving tropical disturbance persisted northeast of Vanuatu, with persistent convection extending toward the Solomon Islands. On June 4, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi classified the system as a tropical depression. With a ridge to the south, it moved to the west-southwest, quickly intensifying into Tropical Storm Gina by June 5 about 970 km (600 mi) east-southeast of Honiara. By 0000 UTC on June 7, the JTWC upgraded Gina to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, after an eye became evident on satellite images. Interaction with the nearby remnants of Tropical Cyclone Epi caused convection to decrease. On June 7, FMS reported that Gina attained peak intensity as a low-end Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Australian intensity scale, with winds of 140 km/h (90 mph). The JTWC recorded winds of 170 km/h (105 mph). A compact cyclone with a well-defined eye, Gina encountered stronger wind shear and cooler waters. After turning southeast and then east-southeast in response to a rapidly approaching trough, Gina quickly deteriorated as the convection became displaced from the centre. By June 9, the centre became uncertain as Gina stalled to the west-northwest of Port Vila. Winds diminished below gale force the next day.
