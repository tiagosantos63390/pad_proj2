However, applying too much nitrogen fertilizer throughout the spring, may result in an abundance of young foliage tissues that could be susceptible to disease.

"AllMusic" highlighted the song; "Idolator" was favorable, too: "frenetic, but far more interesting (than "Woman's World"). This twirler allegedly features backing vocals from Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears, but who can tell? When Cher’s going at full power, lesser entities just kind of melt in the shadows. That said, it definitely features an appearance from one of her most iconic former collaborators: Autotune! Yes, the swoopy sound effect that made her “Believe” single a worldwide smash never really went away, but here it’s displayed so prominently that, when Cher’s voice starts pitching and pouncing all over the place, you’ll swear it’s 1999 all over again. That’s a good thing." "Montreal Gazette" called "Take It Like a Man" a "coy double-entendre" and " shimmering dancefloor swooner."

Observations from Barro Colorado were the subject of Adams et al. (2000). Colonies of "M. wettereri" were found occupying abandoned nests of "Cyphomyrmex longiscapus". The fungus gardens of the "Cyphomyrmex" were intact and the "Megalomyrmex" workers were observed feeding on the fungal symbiont. When lab colonies of "M. wettereri" were placed in contact with colonies of "Cyphomyrmex longiscapus", the "M. wettereri" aggressively attacked, killing the adult workers. When presented with "Cyphomyrmex" larvae, they stripped them of their fungal coating and fed them to their own larvae. Adams et al. (2000) concluded that "M. wettereri" was an "agro-predator," raiding "Cyphomyrmex" colonies en masse, displacing the "Cyphomyrmex" workers, and feeding on the remaining brood and fungi.
