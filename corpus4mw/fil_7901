Acquisition.
On February 26, 2006, Boyer made his debut for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania–based Chikara in a ten man tag team match, where he, Player Uno, SeXXXy Eddy, Dragon Dragon and Retail Dragon defeated Jagged, Shane Matthews, Larry Sweeney and Phil and Sean Davis. On June 23 Boyer entered the Young Lions Cup IV tournament, defeating Brandon Thomaselli in his first round match. Later that same day, Boyer was eliminated from the tournament in the six–way elimination semifinal match by Arik Cannon, who would go on to win the entire tournament. On October 28 Boyer defeated Cannon in a return singles match to win the Young Lions Cup. He then went on to successfully defended the Cup against Josh Daniels and Ricochet. On February 17, 2007, Boyer teamed with fellow IWS performers Jagged and Shane Matthews in the first ever King of Trios tournament. The team, billed as Team Canada, was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by the eventual King of Trios, Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw and Shane Storm. After three more defenses of the Young Lions Cup against Sal Thomaselli, Soldier Ant and Create-A-Wrestler, Boyer was forced to vacate the title in time for the fifth annual Young Lions Cup tournament. As a former champion, Boyer would never again be allowed to challenge for the Cup. Boyer's five successful defenses of the Young Lions Cup would remain a Chikara record until March 2011, when it was broken by Frightmare.
