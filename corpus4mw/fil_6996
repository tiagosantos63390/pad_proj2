IGN's Jeff Haynes felt that Chie's voice actress' delivery at times sounded like a 30-year-old woman instead of a teenager. RPGamer's Michael Cunningham felt that Chie's voice actor in the PS2 version felt "a little stiff" during battle lines, but was fine elsewhere. While Kirk Hamilton was initially reluctant about Chie's new voice actress, he eventually grew to like her. VG247's Johnny Cullen expressed excitement at the prospect of Chie's playability in "Persona 4 Arena". Destructoid's Dale North was not a fan of her new voice, due in part to the fact that he preferred her Japanese voice actress. RPGamer's senior reviews editor Adriaan den Oueden's initial impressions of her new voice actor were positive.
