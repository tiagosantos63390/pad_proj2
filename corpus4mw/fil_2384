The basic type is the "Rikyū shape" ("Rikyū-gata" 利休形), which comes in three sizes: large(大棗 "ō-natsume"), medium (中棗 "chū-natsume"), and small (小棗 "ko-natsume").

There is tremendous variation among the other different types and sizes of "natsume," however. For example, the diameter of the flat type ("hira-natsume" 平棗) generally is about twice the dimension of the vessel's height.
