The home stadium Estádio Milton Barbosa is also known as Calabouço (meaning "dungeon").

Kenneth Edward Doraty (June 23, 1905 – April 4, 1981) was a professional ice hockey player born in Stittsville, Ontario.

Her song "Pirouette" was featured in an advertisement for the 2010 season of "Bondi Rescue". In March that year "Neopolitan Dreams" was covered by Lena Meyer-Landrut, on the quarter final episode of TV show, "Unser Star für Oslo", when she was competing for the opportunity to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest. The exposure generated by Meyer-Landrut's performance saw Mitchell's single reach No. 33 on the German Singles Chart. In April to May 2010 Mitchell went on her Oh! Hark! National Theatre Tour, where she was supported by Sydney-based country blues duo, Georgia Fair, and indie rock group, Boy & Bear. Her tour included over 18,000 fans in attendance.
With all the pain in his heart, at the altar Cesar tells the priest that he does not accept Marisa as his wife. In front of the guests, Cesar tells Marisa how much he hates her and that he was only marrying her for revenge for all those years which she didn't correspond his love. After leaving the wedding, Cesar and Antonia are kidnapped and held hostage by Piedad. Marisa is deeply emotionally hurt. Her wedding was interrupted again. Alone and sad, she is consoled by a fellow medic, Marco Antonio who falls in love with her. When Cesar is finally able to escape Piedad, he rushed to Marisa to explain what happened. Marisa believes him. But when he tries to kiss her, something pushes her away from him. Even though she loves him, a phobia has grown in her that is stronger than her. Every time she gets close to him, she remembers how he abandoned her for the second time at their wedding. Cesar is hurt and believes that she is in love with Marco Antonio. 
Three months later, on 8 July 1989, "Sovetsky Sport" published another article, "Luzhniki's Dark Secret", which received even more publicity in the West. A pair of journalists admitted in the article that they were not familiar with the archived evidence from the criminal investigation and therefore they did not know even the number of fatalities. So, they loosely estimated it at 340 fatalities, citing the unnamed "parents of the children who died", but admitting that it is "an unverified figure". The journalists went further, accusing the police officers at the stadium of provoking this disaster and making some other allegations.
