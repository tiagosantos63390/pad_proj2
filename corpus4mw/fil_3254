In the development of MOS equations, past observations and archived NWP model forecast fields are used with a screening regression to determine the 'best' predictors and their coefficients for a particular predictand and forecast time. By using archived model forecast output along with verifying surface observations, the resulting equations implicitly take into account physical effects and processes which the underlying numerical weather prediction model cannot explicitly resolve, resulting in much better forecasts of sensible weather quantities. In addition to correcting systematic errors, MOS can produce reliable probabilities of weather events from a single model run. In contrast, despite the enormous amount of computing resources devoted to generating them, ensemble model forecasts' relative frequency of events—often used as a proxy for probability—do not exhibit useful reliability. Thus, ensemble NWP model output also requires additional post-processing in order to obtain reliable probabilistic forecasts.

In the 1995 NSW election, Leigh stood as the Labor candidate for the New South Wales state seat of Northcott, receiving an 8% swing, but nonetheless losing by a large margin to Barry O'Farrell.

According to Jungledyret fans, the cats featured in the film's appearance are similar to that of the characters from Felidae, despite having a more non-violent and quite animated (cartoony) appearance.
Lady Frampul and Lovel are conjoined and her chambermaid Prudence, after being offered dowries by a few guests of the inn, chooses to marry Lord Latimer, a young lord who had been invited there by Lady Frampul.
Bangla Bangers, later followed by sequel-series Chop Shop: London Garage, was a reality program on the Discovery Channel about eccentric and unconventional Bangladeshi coachbuilder Nizamuddin "Leepu" Awlia and foul-mouthed Cockney mechanic Bernie Fineman. In every episode they and their team attempt to build a supercar in a mere matter of weeks out of an automobile which they generally obtain from a wrecking yard.
For the moment it was safer ashore. The cavalrymen overran the airstrip. Sporadic opposition allowed them to set up the antiaircraft machine guns on the beach, unload supplies, and patrol inland. Two soldiers were killed and three wounded. At 16:00, General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore. The general inspected the position. A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before. "That's the best thing to do with them," the General replied. He decided to stay, ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow-up force arrived, then returned to "Phoenix". Fechteler's force departed at 17:29, the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition. "Bush" and "Stockton" remained to provide on-call naval fire support.

Twelve of the victims survived the shootings and the fall into the ravine. Seven of them were found by members of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS), who filed a report on the "terrible crime against civilians," but the prisoners were not immediately released and some suffered further abuse while being treated for their wounds at the Hospital for Eye Diseases in Paprikovac. They were eventually handed over to the ICRC on 1 October.

Eight different types of Vivaah have been documented in the ancient Indian scripture "Manu Smrti" III.20-34. In all these types of marriage, an eligible groom is one who has completed his Brahmacharya Ashram (student hood) and an eligible bride is a never-married virgin who has recently attained puberty. The eight types of marriage are:
