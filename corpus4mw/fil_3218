She has also moved to shield social security information and other private information from public view for millions of online records and coordinated with the Ohio General Assembly to prevent the filing of private information.
Another option for making money in Second Life is "camping". Throughout the virtual world are locations where SL members can earn money by either sitting, doing an activity such as dancing or painting, or another similar activity; payment is offered consisting of so-many Lindens for time spent. The money is paid by scripted objects owned by the land owner, usually to increase the search ranking of their store or other venue, and many forms of camping are officially forbidden by Linden Lab, though enforcement of this rule is sporadic. The amount of Lindens paid and the time interval varies from place to place, and some landowners pay in virtual goods rather than Linden Dollars. Since this could result in some users leaving their avatars "camping" for days at a time, accumulating thousands of Lindens, most locations forbid 24/7 "camping" and some camp options limit the amount of money that can be made in a location over a period of time. As of January, 2010, Linden Labs has prohibited camping for lands which are enabled for "search" because traffic is one of the important criteria for search rankings.
Loop 288 is a state highway within the city limits of Denton, Texas. On the north side of town, the loop runs next to the C. H. Collins Athletic Complex. Despite its name, Loop 288 does not make a complete circuit, running instead around the north, east and southeast sides of the city. It begins at an interchange with I-35 on the northwest corner of Denton and loops around the north, east and southeast sides of the city before ending at another intersection with I-35E adjacent to Denton's shopping mall. The total length is . In recent years, several large retail stores have been built on or near the southeast portion of the loop, and this, coupled with ongoing road expansion projects, has resulted in extreme traffic congestion.
The Detroit Public Library (DPL) is the second largest library system in the U.S. state of Michigan by volumes held (after the University of Michigan Library) and is the 20th largest library system in the United States. It is composed of the Main Library on Woodward Avenue, which houses DPL administration offices, and 23 branch locations across the city. The Main Library is part of Detroit's Cultural Center Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places adjacent to Wayne State University campus and across from the Detroit Institute of Arts.


Metro Light Rail (styled corporately as METRO) is a 32 km (20 mi.) light rail line operating in the U.S. state of Arizona. Part of the Valley Metro public transit system, it serves the cities of Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa. Construction began in March 2005; operation started December 27, 2008. The line has 2012 estimated daily ridership of 43,310, making it the 12th busiest light rail system in the country.
Enlighten Harm Reduction is an organisation based in Melbourne, Victoria, dedicated to informing drug users of what different chemicals are in their drugs by using various tests. Prior to receiving heavy amounts of legal and political attention, Enlighten were present at many of the major dance events in Australia, providing facilities for party-goers to test their pills (Ecstasy in particular) for their contained chemicals.

The emirate reached its cultural peak under the emirs Jafar (983–985) and Yusuf al-Kalbi (990–998), both patrons of the arts. The latter's son Ja'far was instead a cruel and violent lord who expelled the Berbers from the island after an unsuccessful revolt against him. In 1019, another uprising in Palermo was successful, and Ja'far was exiled to Africa and replaced by his brother al-Akhal (1019–1037).

The whole park was opened but none of the rides were operational. Visitors had to pay SGD10 to get into the park. Park tickets for the week were sold out in 2 days. The park had its soft opening period from 18 March 2010 to 26 October 2010.
To understand what Dirichlet processes are and the problem they solve we consider the example of clustered data. It is a common situation that data points might be distributed in a hierarchical fashion where each data point belongs to a (random) cluster and is further distributed randomly within that cluster. For example, we might be interested in how people will vote on a number of propositions in an upcoming election. A reasonable model for this situation might be to classify each voter as a liberal, a conservative or a moderate and then model the event that a voter says “Yes” to any particular item as a Bernoulli random variable with probability dependent on which political cluster they belong to. By looking at how votes were cast in previous years on similar pieces of legislation one could fit a reasonable predictive model using an ad-hoc technique such as k-means clustering. However, this depends critically on knowing in advance the number of clusters that generated the data. In many situations it is not possible to determine this ahead of time, and even when there is a reasonable model for the clusters we would still like to be able to check our assumptions. For example, in the voting example above the division into liberal, conservative and moderate might not be finely tuned enough; considerations such as a religion, class or race could also be critical for understanding voter behavior. As another example, we might be interested in modeling the velocities of galaxies using a simple model assuming that the velocities are clustered, for instance by assuming each velocity is distributed as formula_50, where the formula_51th observation belongs to the formula_52th cluster of galaxies with common expected velocity. In this case it is far from obvious how to determine a priori how many clusters (of common velocities) there should be and any model for this would be highly suspect and should be checked against the data. By using a Dirichlet process prior for the clusters we circumvent the need to explicitly specify ahead of time how many clusters there are.
He was born in Pointe-aux-Trembles in 1768 and studied at the Petit Séminaire de Québec. He articled as a notary with Jean-Antoine Panet and then Olivier Perrault, qualified to practice in 1788 and set up practice at Quebec City. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Hampshire in 1796 and was reelected in 1800 and 1804. In 1808, he was elected to represent Kent in the assembly. In 1801, he was named commissioner for the relief of the insane and foundlings. He was appointed clerk of the land roll in 1802 and inspector general of the royal domain in 1803. In 1808, Governor James Henry Craig removed those appointments because he took part in founding the newspaper "Le Canadien". Planté was named a justice of the peace for Quebec district in 1810. He served in the local militia, becoming lieutenant-colonel in 1812. He was a director of the Union Company of Quebec which operated the Union Hotel. Planté also served as vice-president of the Quebec Fire Assurance Company and of the Quebec Savings Bank.
