They are immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only a part of the decidedly tilted edge of the last whorl projects. The seven whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, slightly excurved at the summit, scarcely at all contracted at the periphery and moderately shouldered at the summit.
