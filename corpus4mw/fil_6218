The Codde hofje merged later with the Hofje van Beresteyn, which was founded in 1684, nearly a century later, by the painter Claes van Beresteyn. Claes van Beresteyn was a friend of the Haarlem painter Pieter Soutman who was a regent. The family portrait of the Beresteyns that was later sold as a Frans Hals in the 1880s is now attributed to Soutman.

SH-412A existed prior to the extension of US-412 in Oklahoma. As the adjacent section of highway was part of SH-33 prior to becoming US-412, what would become SH-412A was originally designated as SH-33C. SH-33C was first shown on the Oklahoma state highway map in 1958. At the time of the highway's designation, it was a gravel highway; by 1959, however, it had been paved. The first revision of the state highway map to reflect the renumbering of SH-33 to US-412 was the 1989 edition; this was also the first to show SH-33C redesignated as SH-412A.
