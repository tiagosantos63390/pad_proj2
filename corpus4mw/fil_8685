States sometimes use the term "Unemployment Trust Fund" to refer to their own state account.

The William Moss House is a two-story duplex located at 528 West Genesee Street. This house was built in approximately 1908, and is unusual in Iron County as a middle-class duplex, more so because the floor plans of the first and second floor are dissimilar. It is likely that the original owner, William Moss, occupied the first floor and let out the second. The house is a two-story structure with hipped roof, bracketed eaves, and narrow clapboard siding. It has an Ionic front porch and geometric pattern window sash.
