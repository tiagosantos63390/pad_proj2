In spite of an alarming tendency to make mistakes, Captain Christy was one of the best Irish chasers of his era and his 30 lengths win over Bula in the 1975 King George VI Chase at Kempton Park was a performance of the highest standard. Gerry Newman rode him in that race, but for most of his other successes his jockey was Bobby Beasley. Throughout his career, Captain Christy was trained by Pat Taaffe, and that victory over Bula was the second time he had beaten the dual Champion Hurdle winner. He had outgalloped him in the 1972 Irish Sweeps Hurdle. Captain Christy's most important success came in the 1974 Cheltenham Gold Cup, when he beat the previous year's winner The Dikler. He also went beyond the British Isles and other efforts saw him finish runner-up in the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris and fourth in the Colonial Cup in the USA.

He fights and defeats Tanith Low (nearly killing her by impaling her on his scythe), and even defeats Murder Rose in the third book. In the first book he proves more than a match for Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith and Ghastly put together, and in the end they are forced to retreat from him, during this fight Ghastly is forced to use the power of earth and turn himself into a statue. The White Cleaver does not appear in the fourth book. In the sixth book he acts as a bodyguard to Craven and Melachonia and is torn apart fighting Lord Vile.

Writing in his commentary on the influence of the Young British Artists, "High Art Lite", the art historian Julian Stallabrass said, ""The Cult of the Street" is telling of many characteristics of "High Art Lite" and its engagement with mass culture and the media. It takes as its subject not just the conventions of the street but youth and their modes of display in shops, clubs, parties, restaurants and even private homes ... they don't do much, Bond's people; they shop, of course, persistently, and present themselves to each other and the camera, dance sometimes, but the book is composed above all of an intricate fabric of exchanged glances and gazes."
