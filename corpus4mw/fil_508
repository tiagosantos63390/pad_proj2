When the Soviet Army began its drive across Romania in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The Resistance group ELAS seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944. The insurrection was defeated by British troops who entered Athens at 14 October 1944.

Graham Vivian "Polly" Farmer, MBE (born 10 March 1935) is a retired Australian rules football player and coach. Born in Western Australia, he joined the East Perth Football Club as a ruckman in 1953, where he won several awards and contributed to the team winning three premierships. He was recruited to the Victorian Football League (VFL) league in 1962 for the Geelong Football Club, where he played 101 games and captained the team for three seasons. Farmer returned to Western Australia and became the captain/coach of the West Perth Football Club in 1968, leading the club to premierships against East Perth in 1969 and 1971. After retiring as a player, he coached Geelong, East Perth and Western Australia's first state of origin team.
In his valedictory speech to Parliament on 23 June 2010, Pat Farmer formally announced his long held goal of running from the North Pole to the South Pole, covering some , to raise A$100 million for clean water programs for Red Cross International. Farmer departed the North Pole on 8 April 2011 and finished at the South Pole on 19 January 2012, raising A$100,000 for his efforts. Though the project is called "Pole to Pole" he had stages where he was allowed to take vehicles. Therefore the record has never been ratified. In March 2012, John Howard launched Farmer's memoirs on the journey, called "Pole to pole: one man, 20 million steps". Interviewed on Radio National "Breakfast", Farmer stated that proceeds of book sales would go to Red Cross's campaign for clean water programs.
