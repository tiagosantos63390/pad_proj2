Canon Sheehan wrote the manifesto of the movement in a very long editorial for the first issue of the League's new newspaper, O'Brien's radical Cork Free Press in June 1910, which was a manifestation of Joseph Devlin's militantly Catholic Ancient Order of Hibernians, whose members were also members of the IPP, largely influencing its political course, particularly against any form of concessions to Ulster as advocated by the AFIL. The League, so successful in Cork, was less successful elsewhere. Its principles of establishing a movement of a new kind to attract rather than repel Unionist and Protestant support for an All-Ireland Home Rule settlement, while influentially limited, did motivate a worthy political initiative.
It has also partnerships with leading university institutions like the Universidade Técnica de Lisboa (recently merged with the Universidade de Lisboa, assuming the new name Universidade de Lisboa) and its engineering faculty - the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) which has facilities in the park. Its current president is Professor Carmona Rodrigues.
In the season finale, several flash-forwards over the course of one year show Brooke at various stages throughout her pregnancy. Brooke and Haley officially re-open Karen's Cafe as business partners, and right around this time (approximately four months into her pregnancy), she finds out she's actually carrying twins. Three months later, she falls down as she is trying to get a bag of flour off of a high shelf at the cafe and her babies are delivered prematurely, although another flash-forward shows that her twin boys, Davis and Jude, are perfectly fine and healthy, and Brooke and Julian finally have the family they've always wanted.
