The idea of returning to the mirror universe in "Enterprise" was first suggested by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. In "", the tantalus field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a disintegrator. The Reeves-Stevens proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims, the field instead transported them back through time to a penal colony in the main universe. The "Enterprise" would then come across the penal colony, meeting Tiberius, portrayed by William Shatner.

In August 2012, Suggs appeared at the Queens Hall in Edinburgh as part of the Festival Fringe. In his show, titled "Suggs: My Life Story in Word and Music" he talks about his early life and his search to find out more information about his father. He references his Wikipedia entry and states that some of the information relating to his early life is untrue, adding that he would get bored in interviews and make things up. He confirms that although he was born in Hastings, the family moved around and he spent much of his early life in Wales. He states that his father left when Suggs was three, not before he was born.
The influence of Vedic religion was marked in the religious life of the people in the south. The followers of Veda often entered into dispute with rival religions like Buddhism and Jainism. Hinduism was prevalent during the 1st century CE followed by Buddhism in the next three centuries and finally Jainism taking prominence during the 5th-6th centuries CE. This is well illustrated in the non-religious work of "Cilappatikāram" written during the 1st century CE followed by Buddhist work of "Maṇimēkalai" and the Jain work of "Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi". The joyous life portrayed in Sangam literature is replaced by sombre life depicted in "Maṇimēkalai". It also depcits punishments to the persons, who knowing the inevitability of death indulge in crimes and carnal pleasures.
Phosphorus trifluoride hydrolyzes especially at high pH, but it is less hydrolytically sensitive than phosphorus trichloride. It does not attack glass except at high temperatures, and anhydrous potassium hydroxide may be used to dry it with little loss. With hot metals, phosphides and fluorides are formed. With Lewis bases such as ammonia addition products (adducts) are formed, and PF3 is oxidized by oxidizing agents such as bromine or potassium permanganate.

The village overlooks Allonby Bay in the Solway Firth. The area is within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and the historic county of Cumberland. Allonby, and the five-mile coastal strip of the bay, afford spectacular views across the Solway to the Galloway hills of southern Scotland. Both the South Saltpans beach and the West Winds beach were awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. The village is located on the 150 mile (240 km) Cumbria Coastal Way long distance footpath.
