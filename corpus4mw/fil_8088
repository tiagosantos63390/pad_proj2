Harrison taped a solo demo of "Run of the Mill" at London's Abbey Road Studios on 20 May. Once the full sessions were under way, from 26 May, Harrison gave the song a musical arrangement that Leng has likened to the "minimalist tradition" of the Band's work in 1968–69, an influence that was apparent also in "All Things Must Pass", "Behind That Locked Door" and other tracks on the album. The musicians accompanying Harrison on the session for "Run of the Mill" were all former members of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, with whom he had toured briefly in December 1969 – Jim Gordon (drums), Carl Radle (bass) and Bobby Whitlock (harmonium). In addition, ex-Spooky Tooth Gary Wright played piano.
