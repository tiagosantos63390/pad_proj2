Hopes were high that the 1947-48 squad would take the Hoyas back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1943, when Ripley had coached them to the national final in their only tournament appearance thus far. The team won its first six games, with Kostecka averaging 22 points per game during the first four, one of which was an overtime win over St. John's at Madison Square Garden in New York City - Georgetowns only win over the Redmen in 17 games played between 1931 and 1973.
