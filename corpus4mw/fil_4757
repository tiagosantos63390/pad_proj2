Expression vectors produce proteins through the transcription of the vector's insert followed by translation of the mRNA produced, they therefore require more components than the simpler transcription-only vectors. Expression in different host organism would require different elements, although they share similar requirements, for example a promoter for initiation of transcription, a ribosomal binding site for translation initiation, and termination signals.

From the time of its opening through the decade of the 1980s, it was one of the most popular and upscale shopping destinations in Columbus, drawing in customers from the affluent northern suburbs of the city. A food court was added in a further expansion in around 1990, replacing a Woolworths that had just vacated, and the main mall's facade was updated. During the 1990s, however, the mall began a steady decline caused by the introduction of newer shopping options in the Greater Columbus area. The first new mall in the area in 20 years, the downtown Columbus City Center, opened in 1989 and included several tenants that were unique in the Columbus area (among them Marshall Field's and Jacobson's), which took some business from Northland. However, it remained popular with shoppers in the northern half of Columbus, and continued to be an attractive destination for those who found City Center's downtown location (and paid parking) a hindrance.

A group of children from a London tower block who were sent on holiday to an outdoor activities centre called Felfront Heights, along with their social worker. The first series revolved around their adventures at the centre. In the second series, the children found that the centre had been closed down so the social worker took them to a local village. They became involved with a witch finder, who had spent hundreds of years tracking down a local witch (who turned out to be Mrs Dears, the old lady who ran the local shop). The children travelled into the past, thanks to a time-travelling ambulance, in order to prevent Mrs Dears becoming a witch in the first place. When they returned to the present, the children realised that they had inadvertently changed the course of time, and the present was significantly different from how they had left it—most shockingly, they realised they had stopped America from being discovered by Europeans, and consequently, and paradoxically, there was no such thing as television.
