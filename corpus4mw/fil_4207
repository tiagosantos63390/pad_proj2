He left there to form a business with Bayard F. Snow, a fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers, under the name of X. Henry Goodnough, Incorporated, and did engineering consulting work.

Springsteen's lyrics appear to intentionally and repeatedly allude to his previous songs, an important artistic tradition in poetry and songwriting, continuing and reconnecting the artist's chosen themes they wish to emphasize. The lyric "I was driving through the misty rain" is likely a reference to his song "Downbound Train" on his album "Born in the U.S.A." with the lyric "I feel her kiss in the misty rain." And the lyric "Dancing down a dark hole" likely refers to his song "Dancing in the Dark" from the same album.
