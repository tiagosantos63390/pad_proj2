Plot introduction.
Post Bizzarrini S.p. A.
Aura Triton is Lambert's lover. She was born in A.D. 1223 to a peasant father, with a jewel clutched in her hands, which subsequently disappeared. Her fate was thus sealed: all good would slip through her fingers. Aura, known then as Ursula, became renowned for her unearthly beauty, attracting even the Atrox, who offered her father great treasures if she would betroth it. Seeing her father's poverty, Ursula agreed to the marriage and pledged her devotion for all of eternity, asking only that her beauty should last forever. Yet when Lambert, a follower, came to bring her to the underworld, he fell desperately in love with her, and she with him. Despite attempts to hide their love, the Atrox saw through her deception. When she stepped into the cold fire to receive immortality, the flames destroyed her flesh and bones, reducing her to a wind spirit. Using a potion that Lambert procures from the ancient enchantress Circe, she then lives on by possessing other people and switching bodies whenever the one she possesses becomes old. Aura appears in "Possession" (Book #8), when she begins taking over Serena's body in an attempt to use her powers to free Lambert from Stanton's memories. Other individuals that Aura has possessed include the starlet Ann Anderson and ex-follower Morgan Page.

Italian physicist Alessandro Volta constructed a device for accumulating a large charge by a series of inductions and groundings. He investigated the 1780s discovery "animal electricity" by Luigi Galvani, and found that the electric current was generated from the contact of dissimilar metals, and that the frog leg was only acting as a detector. Volta demonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and brine-soaked cloth or cardboard are arranged in a circuit they produce an electric current.
