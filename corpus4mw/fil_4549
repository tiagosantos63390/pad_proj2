The centre differential contained within many 4 wheel drive cars is similar to the conventional differential in a 2 wheel drive car. It allows torque to be distributed to both drive axles whilst allowing them to spin at different speeds, which vastly improves the cornering of a 4 wheel drive car on surfaces with high grip such as tarmac. However, unlike the differentials on the drive axles which are configured to provide torque equally to both wheels, the centre differential is usually set to have a bias to one set of drive wheels or the other, depending on application of the car. 
It was announced that Triple H was injured with a ruptured quadriceps tendon and he did not compete on WWE television for over seven months. Shawn Michaels however, continued his feud with Rated-RKO by teaming up with Cena and defeating them for their World Tag Team Championship on the post-Royal Rumble episode of "Raw". The feud ended shortly afterwards as Rated-RKO disbanded after their own rivalry began. A Triple Threat match, a standard match involving three wrestlers was made between Edge, Orton, and Michaels. Michaels won the match to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 23. Michaels then feuded with Cena, which would end at Backlash, when Cena defeated Edge, Orton and Michaels in a Fatal Four Way match, a standard wrestling match involving four wrestlers to retain his WWE Championship.
