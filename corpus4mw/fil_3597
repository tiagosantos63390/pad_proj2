The station also has a rebroadcast transmitter in Arnprior, that originally operated on 104.7 FM. That transmitter was certified by Industry Canada Spectrum Management to move to 107.7 FM in 2007, due to potential broadcast interference from the FM conversion of CJRC in Gatineau. The switch in frequency took place in the spring of 2007. In October 2008, power was increased on CHMY-FM-1, and the transmitter site was relocated from the Arnprior water tower to the Glentel site at Mount Pakenham. On April 2, 2014, the CRTC approved My Broadcasting's application for a new English-language station in Arnprior, which will operate at 107.7 MHz, replacing rebroadcaster CHMY-FM-1 at that frequency. On the same date, the CRTC denied My Broadcasting's application for a new station in Carleton Place, which would have broadcast at 97.5 MHz.

The tendency of the United States criminal justice system has been to limit the degree to which one can claim innocence based on mental illness. During the middle of the 20th century, many courts through the Durham Rules and the American Law Institute Model Penal Code, among others, had regarded impaired volition as legitimate grounds for the insanity defense. However, when John Hinckley was acquitted due to insanity, a reversal of opinion occurred, which then spurred a narrowing definition of mental illness. Decisions became increasingly based on the M’Naghten Rules, which asserted that unless one was able to prove that a mental illness kept him or her from knowing that the act was wrong, or knowing the disposition of the criminal act, one would not be able to be tried as mentally handicapped. Contemporary research conducted on the prefrontal cortex has criticized this standpoint because it considers impaired volition as a factor. Many courts are now considering "irresistible impulse" as legitimate grounds for mental illness.
Early years.
The Kingpins featuring Lorraine Muller - The Queen of Ska was a ska band from Montréal, Canada that created Stomp Records label with fellow Montreal Ska band The Planet Smashers. The last Kingpins tour took place in 2004, after which the members of the band reformed under the name Lo and the Magnetics founded by Muller in order to reflect the drastic line-up changes (and musical changes) that had taken place since the band's inception in 1994. During their ten-year reign, the band toured extensively in Canada, the U.S., France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, and Japan. They are known for their danceable ska rhythms, and their catchy song-writing abilities in both English and French.

In the ladies' event, Stephanie Westerfeld had a narrow lead over Laurence Owen after the compulsory figures and performed well enough in the free skating that she might have won the competition. However, Owen followed with a superior effort in the free skate and won the title on a 4-1 split of the first-place ordinals. The men's competition was won by Bradley Lord, likewise in a come-from-behind victory in the free skating after having been second to Gregory Kelley in the compulsory figures. Maribel Owen and Dudley Richards, the silver medalists from the previous year, were the clear winners of the pairs event, while Diane Sherbloom and Larry Pierce -- skating in their first season together—took the ice dance championship.

However, the political bureau was seen by some critics as an endeavor to legitimize the military's incursion to power by basing some of its existence to a return to democratic rule such as open debates and finalizing a return to democracy. In 1987, "Newswatch" magazine released an unofficial report of the bureau, for its reward, it was proscribed for a few months lending credence to some of the criticisms of the regime, as taking Nigerian on a farcical democratic experiment.
