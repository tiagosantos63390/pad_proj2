Lampkin is appointed by Laura Roslin and Admiral Adama as Gaius Baltar's Public Defender after Baltar's previous attorney, Alan Hughes, was assassinated in a bombing. Lampkin uses deceit to manipulate others into revealing useful information. During the period of Baltar's trial, he steals items that give him insight or handicap his opponents. These items often revealed characters' feelings and personalities, such as Adama's uniform button, or they are items people required, such as Roslin's eyeglasses, Baltar's pen, and a bomb part from Aaron Kelly. He often uses his cane as a distraction for his pickpocketing efforts. He typically wears dark sunglasses which allow him to read and observe those around him without giving anything away himself.
