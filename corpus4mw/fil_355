One of the best-known internationally syndicated television series has been "The Muppet Show", which was produced by Grade's English ITV franchise company ATV at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, and was shown around the world, including the United States, where it aired in syndication on PBS, and Canada, where CBC Television aired the show. The 1970s was a time when many British comedies, including "The Benny Hill Show" and "Monty Python's Flying Circus" were syndicated to the United States and worldwide. Many soaps and long-running series are also successfully syndicated around the globe.

Like many BBC Radio comedies, "On the Hour" has been repeated on BBC Radio 7 although most of these deviate from the original broadcast versions. Two episodes from Series One are regularly aired in their 30-minute form, being extended repeats from 1991, while Series Two transmissions are based on the edited repeats for BBC Radio 4. The penultimate episode of Series Two has not been repeated on BBC7, as the master-tape of that episode has apparently been lost. Off-air recordings of the original programmes have been made available through file-sharing and torrent sites.
