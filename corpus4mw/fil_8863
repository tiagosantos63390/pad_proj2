In 1996 Lanzante purchased their own McLaren GTR for use in the British GT Championship, as well as a Porsche 911 GT2 for BPR. The Porsche was also entered for Le Mans, but an invitation to partake in the race was not granted. Langton and Burdell remained in the Porsche, joined by Stanley Dickens and earned several podiums over the season, but Soames Langton suffered life-threatening injuries at the Nogaro round when the Lanzante Porsche crashed. In British GT the team's McLaren was driven by Ian Flux and James Ulrich, and won a race at Donington Park. Although Flux and Ulrich lost the overall championship title to the drivers from Marcos, they did secure the title in the GT1 category.
