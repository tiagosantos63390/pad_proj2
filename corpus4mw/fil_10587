During the 1934 season, the Chicago Maroons were revived with by the play of their star halfback, Jay Berwanger. Michigan, on the other hand, experienced the worst season in its history, failing to win a single game in the Big Ten and scoring only 21 points in the entire season. The two teams met at Stagg Field in Chicago on October 13, 1934, and the Maroons routed the Wolverines 27 to 0 before a crowd of 25,000 spectators. The game marked the largest margin of victory for the Maroons in the long history of the Chicago–Michigan football rivalry. Berwanger scored two touchdowns, including a 43-yard scoring run. The "Chicago Daily Tribune" called the game a "sweet victory" for the "long oppressed" Maroons who had been "starved and bullied these many moons by unsympathetic neighbors in the Big Ten."
