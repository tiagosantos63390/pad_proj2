His eldest son was born in June 1590, so that he presumably married shortly after his return from the Levant. His wife was Mary, daughter of Thomas Revett of Rishangles in Suffolk, by whom he had a large family. The firstborn son died in infancy; but the second, Revett, grew up, was made a baronet in 1641 (see Eldred baronets), and died without issue in 1653, when the estate of Great Saxham passed to the family of John Eldred, Revett's next brother.
