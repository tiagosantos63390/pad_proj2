The VUL supports Touring (Club) teams, Furious George, Blackfish, Traffic, Zephyr and more. The primary goal of these teams is to compete in elite ultimate tournaments, especially provincial, national and international championships.

WSAR was licensed in June 1923 (although in one 1940s station publication, the station claimed September 21, 1921) with the sequentially-issued callsign of WSAR. WSAR's original owner was the Doughty & Welch Electric Company. WSAR's first air date was July 3, 1923. WSAR first operated on 1180kc with 10 watts. It would stay on 1180 through 1926. Power in 1926 was 100 watts. WSAR then moved to Portsmouth, Rhode Island and changed frequency to 1190kc, still with 100 watts, by June 30, 1927. WSAR moved back to Fall River and changed frequency again, to 1410kc, in 1928. During the late 1920s the power was increased to 1,000 watts. An early slogan used by WSAR (sometime between 1926 and 1932) was "Fall River Looms Up."
In 2003, WYDE-FM began simulcasting its programming on co-owned WLGS-AM (1260), which formerly had been an oldies/adult standards station. The call letters of the AM station were changed to WYDE-AM. That simulcast continued until September 2006, when the AM station was taken off the air in preparation for its relaunch as an adult standards station. The new call letters of the AM station were WLGD.

PSG, meanwhile, had a much easier first leg against Austrian side Rapid Wien. They won comfortably 4–0 at the Parc des Princes, with two goals from Brazilian Ronaldinho and one apiece for Bernard Mendy and Nicolas Anelka. Die Grün-Weißen put up a little more of a fight at the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium, taking a 2–0 lead thanks to an early brace from Czech forward René Wagner. However, second half goals from Lionel Potillon and, in injury time, Portuguese midfielder Hugo Leal ensured a dominant 6–2 aggregate victory.
