In 1944, Chau along with his brothers and sisters joined the "resistance" ("khang chien"), that is, the Viet Minh. Here Chau mixed with peasants and workers for the first time, experiencing "the great gap between the privileged... and the underprivileged" and the "vital role" played by the rural villagers in Vietnam's destiny. He participated in the rigors of Viet Minh indoctrination, "critiquing sessions" and party discipline, and admired the dedication of Vietnamese patriots. He lived the rough life as a guerilla soldier, entering combat many times. Yet he saw what he thought a senseless execution of a young woman justified as "revolutionary brutality."
