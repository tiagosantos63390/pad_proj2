The song playing during the wardrobe sequence, "Song for Ten" (named in reference to the Tenth Doctor), was composed by Murray Gold for the episode and sung by Tim Phillips. The last time an original song was written for the series was "The Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon" in "The Gunfighters" (1966). The closing credits had a new theme arrangement restoring the traditional "middle eight" section of the theme which had been omitted in the 2005 series. This was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, conducted by Gold. This arrangement was subsequently used for the closing titles of the 2006 series.

Contractions, where the final letter is present, are often written in British English without full stops/periods ("Mr", "Mrs", "Dr", "St", "Ave"). Abbreviations where the final letter is not present generally do take full stops/periods (such as "vol.", "etc.", "i.e.", "ed."); British English shares this convention with the French: "Mlle", "Mme", "Dr", "Ste", but "M." for "Monsieur". In American and Canadian English, abbreviations like "St.", "Ave.", "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Ms.", "Dr.", and "Jr.", always require periods. Some initials are usually upper case in the U.S. but lower case in the UK: liter/litre and its compounds ("2 L or 25 mL" vs "2 l or 25 ml"); and ante meridiem and post meridiem ("10 P.M." or "10 PM" vs "10 p.m." or "10 pm"). Both AM/PM and a.m./p.m. are acceptable in American English, though AM/PM is more common.
