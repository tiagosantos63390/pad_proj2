Technically Hinrich should have been ejected from the game but he was allowed to stay in. Bulls coach Scott Skiles was quoted as saying "What Kirk did the other (day), that's supposed to be an automatic ejection. They didn't see it. Hopefully, nothing like that happens again." The Bulls went on to sweep the Heat, before being eliminated in 6 games by the Detroit Pistons.
On 18 March there was a significant victory for the Ottoman Empire. For just 118 casualties, they sank three battleships and damaged another with mines and inflicted seven hundred casualties on the British-French fleet. Nevertheless, there were calls amongst the British, particularly from Churchill, to press on with the naval attack. De Robeck advised on 20 March that he was reorganising his minesweepers, suggesting he intended to resume the attack, and Churchill responded that he was sending four replacement ships. With the exception of "Inflexible", the ships that were lost or damaged were old, ill-equipped for modern naval combat and had been chosen for the expedition precisely because they were expendable. It is not correct that the ammunition of the guns was low: they could have repulsed two more attacks. However, the crews of the sunken battleships had replaced the civilians on the trawler minesweepers, making them much more willing to keep sweeping under fire, and the fleet had several modern destroyers fitted with minesweeping hawsers that could have handled the task with ease. The U.S. Ambassador to Constantinople, Henry Morgenthau, reported that Constantinople expected to be attacked and that the Ottomans felt they could only hold out for a few hours if the attack had resumed on the 19th. Further, he thought that Turkey itself might well disintegrate as a state once the capital fell.

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine. It was one of the superiors of the Soviet secret police, Andrey Vyshinsky, who first ordered the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime. However, according to Alexander Etkind, punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era as the GULAG (the acronym for Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, the penitentiary system in the Stalin years) was an effective instrument of political repression and there was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and expensive psychiatric substitute. The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era. From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, that of two separate systems which peacefully co-existed despite conflicts between them:

This arrangement effectively limited the size of the public service database to around 250,000 frames so in order to cope with planned growth by 1981 the IRC machines had been expanded by the addition of two further data drives.
The title gonagas (or konagas), bird man, was a shaman ranking level in Northern Scandinavia amongst noayddes, which possessed special level of spiritual knowledge and visualized themselves to have possession to transform oneself into a bird figure to "fly" over mountains. Because of this spiritual ability, Lundius states they were treated more respectfully or had a higher position than other peoples. According to the myth they could "spiritual communicate," i.e. travel to trading ports in forehand and see what peoples would come to trade. And in the witchcrafting period, the figure could not be burned on the stake because the fire would be smothered in the same way water cannot be ignited.
The "V" Device is worn alone or in conjunction with bronze or silver oak leaf clusters on Army and Air Force service ribbons. The "V" is always worn to the right of any oak leaf clusters from the wearer's perspective. The "V" is worn in the center of the ribbon if no oak leaf clusters are worn.

In the United States, he has appeared several times on American talk shows such as "Late Show with David Letterman" and "Late Night with Conan O'Brien".
The individual who has been traditionally credited as the chief inspiration, if not the direct author of the placards, was the French Protestant leader Guillaume Farel, but it seems that Antoine de Marcourt, a pastor of Neuchâtel from Picardy was the real author: Antoine Froment averred that "these placards were made at Neuchâtel in Switzerland by a certain Antoine Marcourd". Writing anonymously the following month, Marcourt took credit for the placards in the address to benevolent Readers of his anonymous "Most useful and salutary little treatise of the holy Eucharist", published at Neuchâtel, 16 November 1534, in which he avers "I have been moved by true affection to compose and edit in writing some true Articles on the unbearable abuses of the Mass. Which Articles I wish to be published and posted throughout the public places of the land..."

There are three types of bascule bridge designs, and counterweights required to balance a bascule's span may be located either above or below the bridge deck.
The title character is an intelligent robot, the first to be invented. The opening chapters describe the creation of Roderick and show his mind (at first consisting of a bodiless computer program) developing through several stages of awareness. Finally, Roderick is given a rudimentary body and, through a series of misadventures, finds himself alone in the world. Due to his sketchy understanding of human customs, and intrigues surrounding the project that created him, he unwittingly becomes the center of various criminal schemes and other unfortunate events.
The facility had previously been named the Eglin-Hurlburt Airdrome until 1943; Hurlburt Field, March 1944; Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 9, October 1944; with the current name official on 13 January 1948. The base commander of Eglin Main was also responsible for Hurlburt, 1942–1946, but when the base reactivated on 1 February 1955, it gained a separate commander.
WBUR also carries its programming on four other stations serving Cape Cod and the Islands; WCCT-FM (90.3 FM) in Harwich carries WBUR programming via a local marketing agreement, and Boston University also owns WBAS (1240 AM) in West Yarmouth, WBUH (89.1 FM) in Brewster, and WBUA (92.7 FM) in Tisbury; the latter station, located on Martha's Vineyard, uses the frequency formerly occupied by WMVY. Following the acquisition of WBUA, on August 5, 2013 BU announced that it would sell the 1240 AM facility (which then shared the WBUR call sign with the Boston flagship station) to Alex Langer, who will program it with Portuguese-language programming. In 1998, WBUR helped launch WRNI in Providence, Rhode Island—the first NPR station within Rhode Island's borders. It has since sold the station to a local group.
While working on the "Prince of Nothing" series, Bakker was given a challenge by his wife to write a thriller. In response he produced a science fiction suspense novel involving a serial killer who can influence and control the human mind. This book is called "Neuropath" and was published in 2008. A second thriller, titled "Disciple of the Dog", was published in November 2010.
Several years later, Alma met up with a man named Korihor, whom the Book of Mormon describes as an anti-Christ. This Korihor tried to lead the Nephites astray. Alma confronted him, confounding his arguments and miraculously removing Korihor's power of speech. The stricken Korihor signaled acknowledgement that he had acted maliciously, knowing all along that he was wrong and bringing destruction upon others. He was reduced to begging and was eventually run down and killed in a city of Nephite dissenters called Zoramites.

Kleenex Girl Wonder wrote the song "Don't Cry, Ikkyu" about Ikkyu.
Cleghorn's physicality made him a feared defender away from the puck and he was regarded as one of his era's top defencemen. His ability to rush the puck forward also made him a scoring threat; Cleghorn was one of hockey's first offensive defencemen. He once scored five goals in an NHA game in 1913, and had a career best 21 goals in 19 games in 1914–15. He retired in 1928 with 169 career goals, at the time the second most by a defenceman in professional hockey history behind only Harry Cameron. "The Hockey News" ranked Cleghorn as the 88th greatest player of all-time in its 1998 book, "The Top 100 NHL players of All-Time". He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

TsAGI has long been aware of the advantages of forward-swept wings, with research including the development of the Tsibin LL and study of the captured Junkers Ju 287 in the 1940s. Forward-swept wings yield a higher maximum lift coefficient, reduced bending moments, and delayed stall when compared to more traditional wing shapes. At high angles of attack, the wing tips remain unstalled allowing the aircraft to retain aileron control. Conversely, forward sweep geometrically creates increased angle of incidence of the outer wing sections when the wing bends under load. The wings experiences higher bending moments, leading to a tendency for the wings to fail structurally at lower speeds than for a straight or aft-swept wing. The increased bending moment is countered by designing the wings to twist downward (opposite the angle of incidence) as they bend upward.

Autobiography.
Sometime after 1565, Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde, (referred to sometimes as the 10th Earl of Ormonde) spent many years at the court of his cousin, through Anne Boleyn, Queen Elizabeth I. He carried from England a regard for Elizabethan-style architecture, and added a Tudor manor house to the property, the first of its kind in Ireland. 
Some critics have claimed that car donations are essentially a tax shelter. However, non-profit organizations in the US have come to rely increasingly upon the revenue from car donations. This type of donation has become increasingly widespread; in 2000, 733,000 U.S. taxpayers reduced their taxes by $654 million.
Mint stamps are often more valuable than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive. A mint stamp may also be in better condition than a used stamp which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.
Following these events, interest in Westvleteren's output increased and stories appeared of the abbey's stock being low, forcing the monks to reduce the amount of beer sold to each customer. In an interview, monk Mark Bode explained that the abbey had no intention of increasing its production, despite demand: "We make the beer to live but we do not live for beer."
Extrusion welding allows the application of bigger welds in a single weld pass. It is the preferred technique for joining material over 6 mm thick. Welding rod is drawn into a miniature hand held plastic extruder, plasticized, and forced out of the extruder against the parts being joined, which are softened with a jet of hot air to allow bonding to take place.
