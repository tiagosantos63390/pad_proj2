Later on, he became painter of Louis XV's daughters. In 1779 and 1782 he exhibited at the "Salon de la Correspondance" in Paris. Among the works he exhibited at 1782 exhibition were portraits of the d'Espagnac family. Due to his connections to the Royal family (he had been named the “Peintre des Mesdames de France”, artist to the sisters of Louis XV) he was forced to leave France for some time during the French Revolution.

Between late 1942 and early 1943, a heavy anti-aircraft artillery (HAA) battery was established near the summit. A total of 91 buildings were erected, and the battery was staffed between January 1943 and September 1944. It was never used in combat. Of the 21 HAA batteries that were built in New Zealand, this is the only one outside Wellington that still survives, although for most of the structures, only the foundations still remain.

The first stone of the church was laid on July 6, 1931. The temple was consecrated on November 13, 1932 in honour of the Holy Resurrection of Jesus Christ by metropolitan Eulogius (Georgiyevsky).
A prequel novella, "Bioshock Infinite: Mind in Revolt", authored by Levine and Joe Fielder, was made available as an e-book via Amazon.com in February 2013; the work is a reproduction of an in-universe research report entitled "The Psychology of Dissent: Interview with the Anarchist". The fictional report presents a series of interviews between its author, Dr. Francis Pinchot, and Daisy Fitzroy, the founder of the Vox Populi, during a period approximately seven years before the game's events where Fitzroy has been captured by the Founders. Dr. Pinchot, in conducting these interviews, seeks to understand the psychological nature of revolt from Fitzroy. The intent of the novella is to provide additional backstory for the player without revealing any of the game's deeper story, and upon completion of the game, "certain implications of the game and Pinchot's research resonate more", according to Levine.
