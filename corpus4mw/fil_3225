In 2006, Boulard released "The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce—The Story of a President and the Civil War". (iUniverse). The book has since been referenced in the "World Book Encyclopedia" and listed on the Library of Congress Web Guide, "Franklin Pierce: A Resources Guide." It is also a recommended title on the website uspresidentsreadingproject.com. In 2007, the book was named as one of the best presidential biographies on listofbests.com and praised in 2010 by reviewer Bill Clayton on the website AntebellumPolitics.com as "definitely readable...a good short biography for a focus on the end of Pierce's life." Also in 2010, the website Presidential History Geeks called it a "Concise, but captivating history." 12
In 1925, Oslo District Court found Holmenkolbanen not guilty in the lawsuit over damages at Valkyrie plass. A concession was granted on 15 January 1926, which demanded that the tunnel open by the end of 1928. A change of plans moved the line's route to Valkyriegaten under Valkyrie plass, which allowed the cavity from 1912 to became a station, despite it only being from Majorstuen. Past Slottsparken, the original track had been built at an increased depth to allow for a future extension of the Drammen Line of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) to run above the light rail tunnel. By 1926, these plans had been discarded, and the second track was not built as deep.
