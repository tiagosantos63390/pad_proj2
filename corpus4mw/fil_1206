All users utilize a 2,000 word 24,000 digit, magnetic core storage unit. Each of the planes is divided into two sections of 50 by 40 cores, making 2,000 cores in each section. Each section contains one core - for one binary position (bit) - of every one of the 2,000 words. The same relative binary position of the other half-word is held in a core in the same physical location in the other section of the plane. Thus each plane contains two binary positions in each of 2,000 words; the first and 43rd, for example, or the 9th and 52nd. Physically the memory is a rectangular prism .

Response to the report.
Said drove for Phoenix Racing at the Sprint Cup Series road course events in 2011. Following an incident with Greg Biffle, after Said accidentally turned David Ragan (Biffle's teammate) into David Reutimann at the Glen in 2011, causing Reutimann to flip violently, at the garage Biffle punched Said in his car and apparently gestured at Said. Said climbed out and Biffle hid behind his pit crew and while exchanging words Said was prevented by Biffle's pit members from attacking Biffle. After the race Said apologized for wrecking Ragan but angrily retorted; "I'm more upset with Greg Biffle, he is the most unprofessional little scaredy cat I've ever seen in my life, he won't even fight me like a man. So if someone texts me his address, I’ll go see him Wednesday at his house and show him what he really needs. He needs a friggin’ whooping, and I’m going to give it to him. He was flipping me off, giving the finger, totally unprofessional. Two laps down, I mean, he's a chump."... "I went over there to go talk to him and he wouldn't even let me get out of the car and he comes over and throws a few little baby punches, and when I get out, he runs away and hides behind some big guys. But he won't hide from me long, I'll find him. I won't settle it out on the track - it's not right to wreck cars - but he'll show up at a race with a black eye one of these days. I'll see him somewhere." No penalties were given. In 2012, he teamed with FAS Lane Racing to contest the races at Infineon Raceway and Watkins Glen International.

Many roads in Portland are one-way; roads in downtown Portland (Southwest Portland bounded by I-405) are virtually all one-way, forming a grid of alternating street traffic: for north-south roads, odd-numbered avenues (1st, 3rd, etc.) are southbound, while even-numbered avenues (2nd, 4th, etc.) are northbound, and similarly east-west streets alternate. This is partly due to the roads downtown Portland being relatively narrow (). This grid extends a short way west across I-405 into Goose Hollow, terminating at SW 18th Street/PGE Park, and extends to some degree north across Burnside into the Pearl District, particularly with the north-south streets extending into Old Town.

On the question of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas it is unclear whether the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law.

The Russian Space Agency has had success using potassium superoxide in chemical oxygen generators for its spacesuits and Soyuz spacecraft. KO2 has also been utilized in canisters for rebreathers for fire fighting and mine rescue work, but had limited use in scuba rebreathers because of its dangerously explosive reaction with water. The theoretical capacity of KO2 is the absorption of 0.618 kg CO2 per kg of absorbent while 0.380 kg O2 are generated per kg of absorbent. For one KO2 molecule, it's one CO2 molecule but only 0.75 oxygen molecules. The human body though will produce less CO2 molecules than oxygen molecules needed because oxidation of food also needs oxygen to produce water and urea.
