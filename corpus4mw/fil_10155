The East Indiaman "Lord Nelson" was on her return voyage when on 14 August she encountered the three-masted French privateer "Bellone" off Cape Clear, Ireland. "Bellone" captured "Lord Nelson" and put a prize crew of 41 men on board under the command of Lieutenant Fougie. On 20 August "Bellone" and "Lord Nelson" separated. "Seagull" had escorted a convoy from Plymouth to Cork and on her way back at around 1pm on 26 August, Burke sighted a large vessel and immediately set out in pursuit. After a chase of five hours Burke was able to bring his quarry to action in an engagement that lasted throughout the night. At daylight, "Lord Nelson" having expended all her cartridges, Fougie later informed Burke that on "Seagull"s next approach "Lord Nelson" would have struck her colours. However, Burke had to pull back to repair extensive damage to "Seagull"s mast and rigging, and two shot holes between wind and water, i.e., just below her water line.
