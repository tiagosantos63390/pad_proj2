After Dillinger, Cowley was pressed to chase down Lester Gillis (Baby Face Nelson). Near Barrington, Illinois (northwest of Chicago) Nelson began chasing a car with two FBI agents (who were only lightly armed). One of the agents put a bullet through the radiator of Nelson's car. Cowley and another agent, Herman Hollis, arrived in another car and shot it out with Nelson. Cowley was armed with a sub machine gun and Hollis had a shotgun. Nelson, although repeatedly shot by Cowley and Hollis, walked across the road and shot both agents with his sub machine gun.

The Chevrolet Deluxe was introduced late in the 1941 model year as a 4-door sedan. In 1942 a fastback 2-door "aerosedan" became an option. Production was indefinitely delayed in 1942 due to WWII, after 110,000 had been made total, though several thousand Chevrolet coupes and sedans were produced during the war years for military staff use. In late 1945, civilian production resumed. The original series was produced through 1948. A redesigned Deluxe with reduced body contour and integrated rear fenders was offered for the 1949 and 1950 years.
