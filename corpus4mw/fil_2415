Description.
Early history.
Lieutenant Kotler is a young soldier at Auschwitz concentration camp who works for Father (it was shown in the movie that he was only 19-years-old). Kotler has blue eyes and blonde hair, the ideal of the Nazis. He is disliked by Bruno for many reasons, one of them being the fact that Kotler calls Bruno a 'little man' and ruffles his hair.

Although his work is pure fiction from the aspect of critical historiography, Pribojević's basic ideas, however bizarre today, were taken very seriously by his contemporaries. At the time of Humanism and the Renaissance, there was still no established rational and critical apparatus differentiating between truth and fiction in the murky issues of ethnogenesis and national/linguistic loyalties.
