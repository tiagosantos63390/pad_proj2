The EP has being seen by critics simply as "unapologetic hardcore punk" and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being "Four songs like a kick in the teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really."
