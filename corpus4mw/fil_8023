The species is threatened by its small size, as its single population could be easily eliminated by a single large event. It is threatened by the lack of suitable habitat, which has been reduced in size by factors such as fire suppression. Introduced species of plants such as Dalmatian toadflax have invaded the area. Road maintenance practices, herbicides, and pollution may have contributed to the rarity of the plant. The seedlings of the species have a low rate of survivorship, with few growing to mature size. The small size of the population suggests there is a small gene pool.
