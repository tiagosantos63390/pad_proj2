The final rule published on May 14, 1993, requires that refrigerant sold to a new owner be reclaimed to the ARI Standard 700 of purity by a certified reclaimer (Sec. 82.154(g) and (h) referencing standard in Sec. 82.164 and the definition of reclaim found in Sec. 82.152). As discussed in the final rule, this requirement protects the purity of used refrigerant to prevent damage to air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment from the use of contaminated refrigerant. Equipment damage from contaminated refrigerant would result in costs to equipment owners, in releases of refrigerant from damaged equipment through increased leakage, servicing and replacement, and in reduction in consumer confidence in the quality of used refrigerant. This reduction in consumer confidence could lead to the premature retirement or retrofit of CFC or HCFC equipment since consumers would no longer believe that a sufficient stock of trustworthy refrigerants was available.

After learning the incident, Gaddafi lashed out on President Zia and began hosting as well as providing military training to far-left terrorist organization, the Al-Zulfiqar, which was established by Bhutto's children. However, the plan was thwarted by the ISI in 1980 when it had discovered and placed a mole in the Libyan embassy. In retaliation, Gaddafi signed a secret decree which called for the expulsion of all the 150,000 Pakistanis residing in Libya. The children and wife of Bhutto were given asylum by Gaddafi in the 1980s, despite the agitation of President Zia.

The subsequent uprising made the approximately 3,000 insurgents masters of much of the eastern and central districts of Paris for one night; between the Chatelet, the Arsenal and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Cries were heard that the rioters would sup at the Tuileries Palace that evening. However, the rebellion failed to spread. During the night the 20,000 part-time militia of the Paris national guard were reinforced by about 40,000 regular army troops under the command of Marshal de Lobau, who pacified the peripheral districts of the capital. The insurgents made their stronghold in the Faubourg Saint-Martin, in the historic city center. They constructed barricades in the narrow streets around the Rue Saint-Martin and Rue Saint-Denis. On the morning of June 6 the last rebels were surrounded at the intersection of rue Saint-Martin and Saint-Merry. At this point Louis-Philippe decided to show himself in the streets to confirm that he was still in control of the capital. Returning to Paris from Saint Cloud he met with his ministers and generals at the Tuileries to declare a state of siege, before riding through the area affected by the rising, to the applause of national guards and soldiers. The final struggle came at the Cloître Saint-Merry, where fighting continued until the early evening of June 6. Total casualties in the rising were about 800. The army and national guard lost 73 killed and 344 wounded; on the insurgent side there were 93 killed and 291 wounded. The forces of the insurrection were spent.
