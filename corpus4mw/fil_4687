George the Hagiorite, George of Athos, Giorgi Mtatsmindeli or Giorgi Atoneli () (1009 â€“ June 27, 1065), was a Georgian monk, calligrapher, religious writer, and translator, who spearheaded the activities of Georgian monastic communities in the Byzantine Empire. His epithets "Mt'ats'mindeli" and "At'oneli", meaning "of the Holy Mountain" (Hagiorite) and "of Athos" (Athonite) respectively, are a reference to his association with the Iviron monastery on Mount Athos, where he served as hegumen.
He served as team captain, along with Nick Larkin, Jo-Lonn Dunbar and Matt Ryan, who was also selected in the first round; third overall to Atlanta Falcons of the 2008 NFL Draft . He was part of an offensive line that helped support Ryan in his record-setting season including a career-high five touchdown passes vs. Wake Forest and pave the way for the Eagles 5,924 yards in total offense. He started in the victory over Michigan State Spartans in the 2007 Champs Sports Bowl and in the 2007 ACC Championship game loss vs Virginia Tech. Cherilus started a school-record 51 straight games.
