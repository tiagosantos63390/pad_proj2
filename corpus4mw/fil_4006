Although snow pushers did not become widely used until the 1980s, they have been around since the 1970s. Initially, they were not produced by manufacturers, but they were recognized as a good idea by snow removal professionals who either welded their own or contracted to have them fabricated. For a long time, the most common snow pusher design was to take a septic tank or other large steel cylinder and cut it in half, then build a mounting system on the back to attach it to a machine. This type of bare bones construction lasted until the 1990s when various manufacturers began producing them commercially.

Torroja illustrated an interest in forms of art that dwindled within most of his structures which often incorporated his visions.
