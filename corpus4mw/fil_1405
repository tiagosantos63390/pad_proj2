"Les Premieres d'Euvres ou satyres de Regnier" (Paris, 1608) included the "Discours au rol" and ten satires. There was another in 1609, and others in 1612 and 1613. The author had also contributed to two collections : "Les Muses gaillardes" in 1609 and "Le Temple d'Apollon" in 1611. In 1616 appeared "Les Satyres et autres cvuvres folastres du sieur Régnier", with many additions and some poems by other hands. Two famous editions by Elzevir (Leiden, 1642 and 1652) are highly prized. The chief editions of the 18th century are that of Claude Brossette (printed by Lyon & Woodman, London, 1729), which supplies the standard commentary on Régnier, and that of Lenglet Dufresnoy (printed by J. Tonson, London, 1733). The editions of Prosper Poitevin (Paris, 1860), of Ed. de Barthlemy (Paris, 1862), and of E. Courbet (Paris, 1875), may be specially mentioned. The last, printed after the originals in italic type, and well edited, is perhaps the best. See also Vianey's "Mathurin Régnier" (1896); M. H. Cherrier, "Bibliographie de Mathurin Régnier" (1884).
The Free Software Foundation of India (FSFI) Is an Indian sister organisation to the US-based Free Software Foundation. It was founded in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), the capital of Kerala in 2001, as a non-profit Company. The FSFI advocates to promote the use and development of free software in India. This includes educating people about free software, including how it can help the economy of a developing country like India. FSF India regards non-free software as not a solution, but a problem to be solved. Free software is sometimes locally called swatantra software in India.

Meanwhile, when a famous rapper, Luke (Luther Campbell) comes to the strip club, Reggie (Ice Cube) and his friend Clyde (Alex Thomas) are discussing about him. Clyde tries to meet Luke but his bodyguard (Michael Clarke Duncan) informs Clyde that Luke is trying to relax. Clyde insults the bodyguard, inadvertently causing him to hit Clyde in the back of his head as he leaves, barely fracturing his skull and leaving him unconscious. In retaliation, Reggie beats down the bodyguard and fights against Luke and his friends, only for him to be defeated and thrown into a glass pavement.
