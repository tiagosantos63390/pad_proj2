Piggsville is a small residential enclave, four blocks by six blocks, at the west end of the Menomonee River Valley, south of Miller Brewing and the Wisconsin Avenue viaduct, and north of Interstate 94. Various theories have been proposed about its name, but none have been proven true. It is also known as Valley Park, and its neighborhood association is the Valley Park Civic Association. Most of its homes were built in the early 20th century. The area was annexed by the city of Milwaukee in 1925 after petition by its residents. Flooding has been a problem because of its river valley location, and a new concrete retaining wall was built in 2000.

Many of the original members continued with solo careers and a few are still performing today. In 1994, the band recorded another reunion album, "Welcome Back" which included new versions of the songs off the first three albums.

Ten chapters. The job at Shortlands requires him to board a ship in the harbor whenever a flag is raised. This involves being rowed out to the ship and climbing a rope ladder to get aboard. On his first venture, he needs to remain and spend several minutes simply resting before he makes the descent. He thinks he is too old to be able to do the job, or soon would be. Richard had previously said that he would not allow Mary to take in boarders as long as he lived, but says that because this is a resort town, it's the normal thing to do, which gives Mary the idea that he is now proclaiming that it was his idea. The town proves to be his idea, and the claim that it is respectable to take in boarders proves false. Dr. Barker, the only doctor in town, despite being semi-retired and not working nights, still gets all the business. Once summer hits in December, they are led to believe that it will grow. Cuffy deals with papa being called "cranky". Knowing her husband's eccentricities, she thinks this is a natural product of him getting older. Even Mary has to resort to Dr. Barker when Richard gets into unexplainable fits. Tilly had stowed away forty pounds in secret from her husband, and gave them to Mary in her time of need. Richard has to be institutionalized—his status as a doctor getting a fifty percent discount—and Mary is advised to go to work as a postmistress, though it involves mingling with a lower class of people. For this she has to move to Gymgurra "in the Western District, some two hundred miles from Melbourne; to be reached either by night's sea voyage--round Cape Otway and along the wild coast--or by a combined train and coach journey." Mary goes to pay a surprise visit to the hospital to determine the sort of care Richard is receiving. Along the way, she meets Mrs. Bowman, whose son has been injured in tree-felling and is likely to die. Upon reaching the hospital, she is told that "Patient 97 B" is kept in solitary confinement on the grounds that he may "corrupt" the other prisoners. She learns that his personal foibles have not been attended to: he has been throwing his meals back at his keeper because they are served to him on tin plates rather than china. Feeling he can never get well in such conditions, she removes him from the hospital and takes him to their new home at the post office, hiring Mrs. Bowman as a caregiver. He does not recognize his children at their age, and wonders where his twin babies are. Cuffy begins to resent having to take him out for walks each night. Finally, he is confronted with the murderous nightmare, an image to long haunting his dreams and memories, such that seeing any body stretched out face down in the road could send him into fits, when he and Lucie are unable to stop a fall from which Richard cannot get up, and gets him laughed at for drunkenness by a passerby. Home in bed, gangrene sets in, and quickly renders the lower half of his body completely useless. Mary sits by the bedside as "Bowey" takes over the kitchen chores. Richard, finally tells Mary "not grieve...for me. I'm going...into Eternity...Dear wife". "He died at dawn, his faint breaths fluttering to rest.". Cuffy feels a mixture of relief, albeit guilty, and upset, then begging for his return, even though his experience with Lallie made clear to him that he wasn't. The small funeral includes Tilly, Jerry, the parson, and the Bank manager. A small cross rose is placed on his grave, but is eventually neglected, toppled by weeds, and removed. "And thereafter, his resting-place was indistinguishable from the common ground. The rich and kindly earth of his adopted country absorbed his perishable body, as the country itself had never contrived to make its own his wayward, vagrant spirit."

According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 11% of West Branch Area High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
