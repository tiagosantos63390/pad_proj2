Following Uganda's calls for a ceasefire on 1 November and government shelling the next day, as well as a new offensive on 3 November in the hills around the border with Uganda and Rwanda, M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa called to "immediately end hostilities" and that "we call on the facilitator of the Kampala peace talks to immediately put in place a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire." Despite the calls, the army accused the rebels of bombing Bunagana. Army spokesman Olivier Hamuli said: "This is not fighting, it is bombs launched by M23 targeting the population of Bunagana. They are targeting civilians." Conversely, the rebels said that they were attacked with heavy weapons. "Radio Okapi" reported that four civilians were killed and 10 others were wounded in Bunagana on 4 November. UN, EU and AU envoys urged both sides not to undo the progress made in peace talks and that M23 should renounce its rebellion and the army should hold off from further military action.

At the age of 26, Gobillard stood orphaned along with her siblings as their mother passed away in 1893 and resided with her aunt, Berthe in Paris. During their stay with her aunt, she and her sister Jeanne stood initially as models for her paintings. Favored by her aunt as a model in her works, Berthe taught her painting. Impressed by her Impressionistic tutelage, she painted the everyday life of children, women and the outdoors with the tenderness of light pastels notably in the depiction in her still-lifes of flowers in their vases. She also drew upon the color hues from her other mentor, Pierre-Auguste Renoir who brought sensuality to the style of Impressionism. Renoir would often implore the Gobillard sisters to pose for him as models and teach them on the side, painting during his encounters in the southern coast of France, notably in Brittany. In 1894, she held her first exhibition of her works and was subsequently exhibited with other prominent artists during that period at the Société des Indépendants, respectively in 1904 and in 1926. Gobillard continued painting and lived until 1946, when she died in Paris.

Béla IV donated Chrenóc (; today part of Chrenovec-Brusno) in Nyitra County to Matthew I in 1243. One year later he acquired the estate of Pruszka (today: "Pruské, Slovakia") in Trencsén County, which previous landowner died without heirs. Later Matthew I exchanged that land to Tunig, Pozsony County. According to a royal charter issued in 1249, Béla IV formerly also donated Racsic (; today part of Nitrica) to Matthew, who was already dead by that time. There is no source about his inherited possessions, thus data on his four sons' inherited estates also does not exist. Consequently, he did not initiate his family through the establishment of oligarchical power with land acquisitions, he just marked its direction (from the ancient estates of the genus in Fejér County to northwest).
