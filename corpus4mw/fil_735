Bethany (Aramaic: בית עניא, "Beth anya", "house of misery/poverty"; ) is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper.

Okurigana for disambiguation are a "partial" gloss, and are "required": for example, in 下さる, the stem is 下さ (and does not vary under inflection), and is pronounced くださ ("kudasa") – thus 下 corresponds to the reading くだ ("kuda"), followed by さ ("sa"), which is written here "kuda-sa." Note the okurigana are not considered part of the reading; grammatically the verb is "kudasa-ru" (verb stem + inflectional suffix), but orthographically the stem itself is analyzed as "kuda-sa" (kanji reading + okurigana). Compare with furigana, which: specify the "complete" reading, appear "outside" the line of the text, and which are "omitted" if understood.
