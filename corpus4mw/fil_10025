Going into the fourth quarter, the tables had turned on Michigan State, with the Ducks leading the game 39–27. The stout Duck defense would force a turnover on downs deep in their own territory, but on the ensuing possession Oregon was again forced to punt the ball away, giving Michigan State the ball, down 12 points with nine minutes left to play. The Oregon defense again showed their talent by intercepting Connor Cook again, giving their offense back the ball to close out the game. The Oregon offense then methodically drove the 96 yards in six and a half minutes, converting two third downs and scoring a touchdown on fourth down to all but finish the game at 46–27. The victory improved Oregon's all-time record against the Spartans to 3–2.
