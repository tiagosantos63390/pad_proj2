Andy Gill of "The Independent", however, was more negative. He gave the album two stars and said, "The opener, "You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You", is a decent showcase for his burly-voiced brand of R&B pop â€“ but elsewhere, Arthur grossly overdoes the emotional groaning that passes for vocal expression in the album's more overwrought corners." In his review for the "Metro", John Lewis stated that "the good moments are overwhelmed by the stench of focus-grouped blandness." and awarded the album two stars. In an extremely negative review, Sylvie Levished of "Evigshed mag" gave the album 1/5 and wrote "All in All, not really sure if James Arthur's behavior is the best way to promote his music specially when he is just a beginner in the music industry. His album is nothing special. Very different from factor winners, the young songwriter/singer shines until now, with his narcissism, his pride, an extreme disrespectful for his label mates and other young artists, coupled with a big arrogance in media and through his twitter account. If he put as much energy into his music, it would certainly be better. It is cold, without emotion. Not recommended."
