The Westall UFO encounter is an event that occurred on 6 April 1966 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Around 11.00 am, for about 20 minutes, more than 200 students and teachers at two Victorian state schools allegedly witnessed an unexplained flying object which descended into a nearby open wild grass field. The paddock was adjacent to a grove of pine trees in an area known as The Grange (now a nature reserve). According to reports, the object then ascended in a north-westerly direction over the suburb of Clayton South, Victoria, Australia.
When the Civil Government was established on July 4, 1901, the Philippine Commission proposed the creation of an Office under the Department of Interior to take charge of the conservation, promotion and development of the country's fishery resources. This was not carried out, due to limited funds. The Secretary of the Interior continued to stir interest in the development of fisheries and, finally, in 1907, studies in fisheries began following the arrangement made by the Secretary of Interior for the services of the United States Fish Commission fisheries research vessel "USS Albatross" to work in Philippine waters for 18 months and the employment of an American specialist in fisheries in the Bureau of Science, formerly known as Bureau of Science to take charge of all work pertaining to fisheries.

Even though extensive research has been carried out through the years, historians have been unable to fully explain all aspects of the complex. No documents have been preserved that have enabled determination of the either the date of commencement of the castle’s construction or the date of its completion. The name of the architect is also unknown. Krzysztof Ossoliński was enamored with black magic; while the unique symmetry of the castle is evident even in its ruined state, the hidden meanings that may have been incorporated into virtually every part of the castle are not obvious.

The nine-hole course, "Old Borre" is par 36 and 2927 meters long (3200 yds) from champion tees. This is the back-nine of the original course, and demanding enough, with water in play on seven holes and surrounding forest on most of the course. 

Strictly created ISO 9660 filenames can only contain up to 8 capital letters or digits, followed by a period and up to three more capital letters or digits. TRANS.TBL is simply a normal file in each directory, containing the extended versions of file names in that directory; a system reading the filesystem can then use the extended filenames (sometimes called "long filenames") instead of the ISO ones.

Next he co-executive produced, along with Ted Hope & Anne Carey, an HBO television mini-series of Moisés Kaufman's play "The Laramie Project". The mini-series version of "The Laramie Project" was adapted by Kaufman and members of New York's Tectonic Theater Project who went to Laramie, Wyoming after the murder of Matthew Shepard. The piece is based on more than 200 interviews they conducted while there. It follows and in some cases re-enacts the chronology of Shepherd's visit to a local bar, his kidnap and beating, the discovery of him tied to a fence, the vigil at the hospital, his death and funeral, and the trial of his homophobic killers. The mini-series mixes real news reports with actors portraying friends, family, cops, killers, and other Laramie residents in their own words. It concludes with a Laramie staging of "Angels in America" a year after Shephard's death. 
The Ford Fiesta supermini received a facelift and added the "Zetec S" model that has a 1.6 16-valve Zetec engine.

The early trail days employed Red River cart and bull or horse and cart. This method of travel was upgraded to rail travel until the advent of the industrial revolution and mechanized motor travel. Automobile and truck travel was employed in the early 20th century with early highways and roads being under construction. The early roadways for the main, ran parallel to the rail lines. The auto was abandoned in the depression years of the dirty thirties, and cars were towed by horse and became known as Bennett buggies. The years following World War II showed much growth as the social economic lifestyle of Saskatchewan changed considerably. Gone were the farmers on each quarter section, and also leaving the prairie landscape were elevators. Grain storage elevators used to be required every 6 miles for loads by horse and cart. Combines introduced large scale farms, trucks introduced larger centres with a larger quantity of elevators. Soon also the branch rail lines disappeared. As farms became larger, so too did many of the early township roads and road allowances disappear.

Heavy rainfall continued northward into the Carolinas. Much of South Carolina experienced over 7 inches (175 mm) of precipitation; statewide, the rainfall peaked at 13.96 inches (355 mm) in Pageland. The highest totals in 100 years in some locations also ended a severe drought. In the flooding, 80 bridges in the state failed; in total, more than 120 bridges were either closed, damaged, or destroyed. In South Carolina, the system caused three drowning deaths; damage totaled $12 million (1990, $  USD). In North Carolina, rainfall reached 10.74 inches (273 mm) in Albemarle. The storm directly caused two deaths in North Carolina, and indirectly caused two traffic deaths.

In 2013, amidst growing debate around a campaign for the Washington Redskins football team to change their name, a writer for "The Cleveland Scene" described what he saw as the difference between the Redskins debate and the Chief Wahoo debate: "Bluntly, there's zero legitimate debate as far as Chief Wahoo is concerned. Zero. It's an aggressively racist symbol, and it's mortifying if you take thirty seconds to look at the image, or think about it in a human context."

In 2012, the "Belle of Louisville" and "Belle of Cincinnati" were joined in the race by the "American Queen".

While in Kuwait, Shakespear made seven separate expeditions into the Arabian interior, during which he became a close friend of Ibn Sa'ud, then the Emir of the Nejd. It was Shakespear who arranged for Ibn Sa'ud to be photographed for the first time. Ibn Sa'ud had never seen a camera before. In March 1914, Shakespear began a journey from Kuwait to Riyadh and on to Aqaba via the Nafud Desert, which he mapped and studied in great detail, the first European to do so. In November 1914, the British government in India asked Shakespear to secure Ibn Sa'ud's support for the British-Indian Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, which had just taken Basra.
