On 12 January 1916, the 179th (Cameron Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, CEF was authorized and gazetted under command of Lieutenant-Colonel James A. Cantlie. The nucleus of the 179th was formed from absorbing the 79th Cameron Highlanders of Canada Drafting Detachment on 1 February. On 30 May, Lieutenant-Colonel Cantlie, whose poor health precluded him from overseas deployment, relinquished command to Lieutenant-Colonel J. Y. Reid and the Battalion moved by train to Camp Hughes. Training at Camp Hughes throughout the summer of 1916, the 179th entrained for overseas deployment on 26 September. Arriving in Halifax, the Battalion embarked on HMTS Saxonia on 4 October, and set sail for England. The 179th battalion arrived at Liverpool on 13 October, where they disembarked and proceeded to East Sanding Camp. On 4 January 1917, the 179th was re-designated the 14th Reserve Battalion and moved to Upper Dibgate Camp.

In August 2008, Stewart was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad alongside other Manly players Brent Kite, Josh Perry, Anthony Watmough, David Williams, and his brother Glenn. Unfortunately however, Stewart was forced to withdraw with a shoulder injury before the competition had begun. It had been rumoured that Stewart's late season form in 2008 saw him selected to the Kangaroos as the number one fullback in front of the incumbent Billy Slater. However, in Stewart's absence, Slater went on to cement his spot in the national side and was the leading try scorer in the World Cup with 7 in 4 games.
