During the Second World War Harold Williams had a distinguished military career. Jean and their young daughter had returned to Melbourne in December 1940, and with hostilities imminent he followed in August 1941 in a Dutch ship that sailed via Java. He immediately enlisted and served with distinction in Australia, Africa, the Pacific and Burma, attaining the rank of Major. In 1945 he returned to Japan with the Occupation Forces, and was attached to General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, where his knowledge of the country and its language proved invaluable. In 1949 he resumed his business career, first as Managing Director of A. Cameron and Company, later as Proprietor.
Following Night of Champions, the Raw brand did not have a top-tier championship belt, as Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand and took the WWE title to the program. On the June 30 episode of "Raw", Edge made an appearance, causing Batista to show up and beat him down. Shortly afterwards, Edge lost the World Heavyweight title to CM Punk, after Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract, making the World title exclusive to the Raw brand, once more. Punk would lose the title at Unforgiven, after he was unable to compete in the title match at the event, following an attack backstage by Randy Orton. The match was won by Chris Jericho, who was named as his replacement. The ECW Championship was made exclusive to the ECW brand, following Mark Henry's win at the event. Henry, however, lost the title to Matt Hardy at Unforgiven in September. Triple H dropped the WWE title at Survivor Series.
