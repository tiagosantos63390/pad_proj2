State Route 155 begins at a four-way stop intersection in Shawnee where State Route 93 forms the southern and western legs. Going east from that intersection, woods bound the highway to the south, while Shawnee's Main Street runs parallel to the state route immediately to the north, with the main portion of the village on the north side of Main Street. State Route 155 curves northeast and then starts to bend to the southeast, at which point Main Street converges with the highway. Thereafter, the state route intersects New England Hill Road, then rounds out curving to the southeast. Departing Shawnee, State Route 155 enters into Salt Lick Township and the Wayne National Forest. As such, the majority of the highway is bounded by forest on both sides, with some open space appearing from time to time. The highway trends generally east-southeast and then east, before reaching the Sulphur Springs Road intersection. Now bending to the southeast, the route passes a few houses prior to passing into Hemlock. Known as Sanders Street through the village, State Route 155 passes both woods and houses, and intersects Main Street before curving east.
