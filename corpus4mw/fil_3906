His career as a musician began in 1939, when he was 17, and was connected to musical theatre, and chiefly to Uzbek radio. Working without a teacher he developed his own special style and technique on the dutar and other instruments. Although many older masters who listened him, believed that he played incorrectly, his compositions became popular on the radio and many listeners liked the simplicity and sincerity of his music. "If I had a teacher, then I might hate the music, because I would have been embarrassed to play the dutar for a teacher" he said. After finishing the tenth grade, he joined Theater of Young Audiences where he found a job as a violinist. At the same time, he became an instructor and directed his own amateur music society as the supplementary activity. Turgun Alimatov worked and performed in the Theatre of Young Audiences until the beginning of World War II. In 1941, he resigned and was sent to the military front. After one year in the Second World War, In August 1942 he was wounded in the leg and evacuated to a hospital in Siberia, and then back to Tashkent. While he was recuperating, he knew that the Muqimi Theatre of Musical Drama, the largest and the most popular Theatre in Uzbekistan announced a competition for musicians and singers, whose winners would be freed from duty at the front. Turgun Alimtov entered the competition and won a place in the theater’s music ensemble. Then, the performer has worked at the Republican Radio as a leading tanbur payer in national and instrumental ensemble headed by Yunus Rajabiy. From 1985 until the end of his life, Turgun Alimatov worked at Tashkent State Conservatory as honorable professor. From 1991, he started his solo tour programs in US, UK, Germany, and France becoming the first Uzbek musician by his solo concerts abroad. His art and creative work has not until now been the subject of serious study by ethnomusicologists.

One morning Eddie answers the door, and is greeted by three boys dressed in devil costumes playing trick or treat. When he fails to give them any sweets, they "trick" him by ramming a toy trident into his crotch. Realising that it is Halloween, Richie forms a plan; he and Eddie will go trick-or-treating to raise money for a party which will feature, in Richie's words "lots of booze and drugged-up babes.shaggy-shaggy-shag!" They go down to the local costume shop, and Richie returns with a woman's devil outfit, while Eddie ends up dressed up in a giant banana costume. To make sure that people give them money, Richie asks Eddie to bring along an electric cattle prod which they have somehow obtained; unfortunately, when he tries to use it the electricity arcs back and causes Richie's bowels to loosen, ruining one of his three pairs of tights.

Following the assimilation of Malacca into the British Empire in 1795, a modern police organisation in Malaysia was formed, on 25 March 1807, after the Charter of Justice in Penang was granted. Most of the officers were of British origin. Later, this organisation was developed in the Straits Settlements and other Malay states, particularly the Federated Malay States. At that time, independent police forces were established for each respective state. Only after World War II was a central police organisation formed, known as the Civil Affairs Police Force. This organisation was formed in Malaya and led by a British colonial, H.B. Longworthy, who had to stabilise the police forces after the anarchy of Japanese occupation. One of the immediate problems faced by the police at this time was the rebellion of the communist party. During the confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia, which lasted from 1963 to 1965, the police force, along with military forces, fought against the infiltration of Indonesian forces into the states of Johor and Sabah.
