The Chinese Room's first three projects were two mods for "Half-Life 2", named "Antlion Soccer" and "Dear Esther", and a "Doom 3" mod titled "Conscientious Objector".

In 2009, The Chinese Room developed "Korsakovia", which was a survival horror mod.
Biography.
Although several short stories in Balinese had been published, such as "Balian" by I Madé Pasek in 1913 and "Loba" and "Anak Ririh" by Mas Nitisastro in 1925, the modern period is commonly considered to have started in 1931 with the publication of I Wayan Gobiah's novel "Nemoe Karma", the first in the language; this is based on the fact that the novel was easier for readers to obtain than the short stories. Between 1931 and 1959, only two other works of modern Balinese literature were published: the serialised novel "Mlantjaran ka Sasak", published in "Djatajoe" from 1935 to 1939; and the poetry anthology "Basa Bali", published in "Medan Bahasa Basa Bali" in March 1959. However, Balinese writers continued to contribute to the national literature by writing in Malay and, later, in Indonesian.
