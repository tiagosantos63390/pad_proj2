Tension between the brothers grows further when Peddodu tries to speak to Chinnodu but Chinnodu says they are good for nothing and cannot achieve anything. Seetha who witnesses this plans to visit to solve all their family problems. For the Sri Rama Navami Kalyanam at the Bhadrachalam temple, havoc rises because of a short circuit in the tent.
