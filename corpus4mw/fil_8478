In embattled Abyan, local tribes agreed to form a temporary alliance with the government to fight Islamist militants in Zinjibar and other towns controlled or contested by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other violent Islamist groups. Armed tribesmen joined with government troops "en masse" for the first time since the uprising began in the province, reportedly surrounding the militants late at night in what a government official claimed were the largest clashes in Zinjibar since Islamists took control of the town weeks earlier.
On 7 March 2014, Keane joined Championship side Blackburn Rovers on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. Keane was handed the number 16 shirt number for his time at Ewood Park. He made his debut for the club on 9 March, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 defeat at home to local rivals Burnley. Keane returned to Old Trafford on the completion of the Championship season and was named on the bench for Manchester United's last home game of the season against Hull City.
The 1980s got off to a promising start for Norway with a victory against Bulgaria. The good run continued with a 6–1 win against Finland (a game where Pål Jacobsen scored four goals) and victory against Switzerland in a World Cup qualifier.

History and architecture.
Unlike the majority of fictional worlds where magic works, which tend to be set in Archaic or Medieval societies, "Toxic Spell Dump" is set in a recognizable present-day United States (specifically, in a very recognizable analogue of Los Angeles), with many present-day technologies and institutions having a magical equivalent (for example, the analogue of the CIA is staffed by actual, literal spooks, and computers use a multitude of imps instead of microchips). The title refers to magic spells that can have toxic side-effects, much the same as industrial practices in our world; therefore, there is the need for a place where those toxins can be dumped to avoid damaging the environment.
