Bach wrote other works for university occasions: the motet is one of twelve surviving "", that is music for festivals of the Leipzig university. The work is also part of another series, the Bach motets, which were possibly all written for funerals. There is scholarly debate about the exact number of motets attributable to Bach, and, as in some cases the circumstances of the first performance are not known, their function.
"Digital Spy" said; "Blow my mind, DJ, blow my mind," The Saturdays member Vanessa demands in a hazy and heavily synthesised fashion on the intro of the new The Saturdays single. Opening with what feels as if we've caught her in the middle of a boozy night out, it not only makes a change from her usual ad-libbing duties, but marks a sizeable shift for a group whose image relied on being squeaky clean... until now, that is. We make the party super naughty," Rochelle [Wiseman teases before strutting her stuff on the bar, while serial good-girl Mollie unleashes her inner animal as she chants "getcha claws out" over a thumping Xenomania-helmed beat. Meanwhile, Frankie [Sandford finds herself on "the edge of desire" in a quiet corner with her fella and Una urges hers not to forget her anytime soon.

Since the rebel taking of Sorman, both parties controlled part of the road between Tripoli and Tunisia, preventing either from supplying Tripoli from that country. The rebels made a successful attack on the border town of Ras Ajdir on 26 August, and on 28 August Tunisia reopened its border with Libya. It appeared that by that time rebels had taken the last intervening town, Ajaylat, consolidating the route to the capital, where shortages of food, water, fuel, and medical supplies were creating difficulties, though later reports indicated that a loyalist "pocket" remained at Ajaylat, with supply lines bypassing the town. Loyalist forces continued to shell the area from the interior.
