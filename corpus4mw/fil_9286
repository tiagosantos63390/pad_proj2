and that there exist infinitely many graphs for which pair-cr("G") ≠ odd-cr("G"). No examples are known for which the crossing number and the pair-crossing number are not the same. It follows from the Hanani–Tutte theorem
An important movement of Czech art in the 20th century was Cubism, the most creative period being 1910–19. Whilst there were visual artists who worked in the style, Czech Cubism is often mostly associated with architecture, so much so that the art historian Miroslav Lamac commented "Prague became the city of cubism". Bohumil Kubišta is an important artist associated with the movement and his work displays many French influences such as the brushwork of Cézanne as well as the obvious influence of Picasso. František Kupka is probably the most internationally recognised Czech artist from the period and his work continued to evolve past Cubism, eventually establishing himself as an early pioneer of abstract art.
