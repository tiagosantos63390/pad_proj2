Voiced by Michael Sheehan – Jerrica's long-time childhood friend and boyfriend, who plays a Mal Evans-like role as a road manager and engineer for the Holograms. He loves Jerrica, but has a crush on Jem, which evolves into something more as the series progresses. Rio has issues with secrecy, anger and lying which are never fully explained but it is those issues which make Jerrica reluctant to reveal herself as Jem for fear that Rio will feel betrayed. Throughout the series the dynamics of the relationship change and a classic Love Triangle develops.
