The mansion was built on 300 acres of property that Baker inherited and an adjoining parcel he purchased. The building was based on an English home, with 49 rooms. The outside was clad in fieldstone. The roof was red tile. Fireplace mantles were hand carved. Several tenant houses and a formal garden were built on the property. A world traveler, Baker described Ingleside as his only true home.

Certification standards for teachers are determined by individual states, with individual colleges and universities determining the rigor of the college education provided for future teachers. Some states require content area tests, as well as instructional skills tests for teacher certification in that state.

Other raptors, large and small, are often outright dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized "Buteo" species is thought to be due to the radiation of large "Aquila" eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no "Aquila" eagles other than the golden eagle, "Buteo" species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's ("Buteo swainsoni") and ferruginous hawks ("Buteo regalis")) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three "Buteo"s. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys ("Pandion haliaetus"), Black kite ("Milvus migrans"), hen harriers ("Circus cyaneus"), Eurasian sparrowhawks ("Accipiter nisus"), Cooper's hawks ("Accipter cooperii"), northern goshawks ("Accipiter gentilis"), red-shouldered hawks ("Buteo lineatus"), common buzzards ("Buteo buteo"), long-legged buzzards ("Buteo rufinus"), upland buzzards ("Buteo hemilasius"), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels ("Falco tinnunculus"), American kestrels ("Falco sparverius"), merlins ("Falco columbarius"), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons ("Falco rusticolus"). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitata there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.

On August 6, 2011, Andrea Nuila co-organized the event with her group Atrévete, the Tegucigalpa chapter of Hollaback!, an international women-led movement to end street harassment. For Nuila, the march is also about confronting the dangerous combination of male dominance and impunity that puts Honduran women at risk, as seen in the high occurrence of femicide. "They're increasing every day. We believe that women are not only victims of sexual harassment, they're also victims of domestic violence. And we have a big level of impunity from the state institutions" she said.
This is the first iteration seen, introduced simultaneously as the 1700 and 1900 variations. A bore and a stroke means a displacement. 15N and 15S (low and high octane versions, for "Normal" and "Super") were on offer, as with most of Opel's engines of the 1960s and 1970s. Power ranged from for the 15N while the rare 15S (only installed in the export only Kadett B 1.5) has .
