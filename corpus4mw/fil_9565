Gavin Robertson, Jilly's handler, revealed that Jilly would be retired after Crufts. He said "We always decided this would be Jilly's retirement show, so really wanted this to be her best. I can't express how happy I feel, she never lets me down, she's my once in a lifetime dog. I am sad Sunday will be our last show, but she has really given me everything. It is like our cup final." Robertson also stated that Jilly may have a litter of puppies later in the year.

The subject matter of Boccioni’s work, a deconstructed glass bottle, fits into the framework of futurism, a movement largely obsessed with recent technological innovations. Technology to mass-produce glass bottles was first implemented in the latter portion of the 19th century and began rapidly expanding around the time Boccioni began to formulate his work in 1912. Boccioni first provided a sketch of "Development of a Bottle in Space" in his manifesto, as an example of a work that deconstructs the three-dimensional space in and around itself. A year later Boccioni would take his initial sketch and use it as the basis to produce the work’s recognizable form as a bronze sculpture. Once exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco (1915), "Development of a Bottle in Space", has since become part of the collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. An original bronze cast (1935) is displayed at the Museo del Novecento in Milan.

Moreover, "the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness'. . . . Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity". (§5) Philosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the individualist, bourgeois philosophy of the subject, which is founded upon the voluntary and conscious subject. Against said ideology is the primacy of social relations. Existence — and thus the world — is the product of human activity; but this can be seen only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness is an effect of ideological mystification.
