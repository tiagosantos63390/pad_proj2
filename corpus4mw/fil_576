In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple. The suit alleges that the manufacturer's marketing use of the words "all natural" is fraudulent because the drink is made with corn syrup. However, Snapple retaliated by arguing that their "Orangeade" flavor contained real chunks of oranges. The complaint also raises the issue of Snapple drink names including fruits when the products do not contain those fruits.
The Liberals and NDP reached a deal to topple the current government and form a minority coalition government, with support from the Bloc Québécois. In the agreement, Dion would have been the interim Prime Minister, maintaining that he would step down in May when the Liberal Party elect his successor. Dion sent a letter of the plan to Governor General Michaëlle Jean, and the opposition had scheduled a non-confidence motion for 8 December 2008. To draw public support, Prime Minister Harper and Dion both addressed the nation on 3 December 2008. Dion's Liberal rebuttal, however, was considered poor in production quality and delivered late to the networks, and some believed that this had undermined support for the coalition. On 4 December 2008, the Governor General granted Prime Minister Harper's request to suspend parliament until January 2009, thereby delaying a scheduled non-confidence vote and the likely defeat of the Conservative government.

A monument was erected in honor of Griffith at Griffith Stadium. After the stadium was demolished in 1964, the obelisk was moved to Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, where the Washington Nationals played between 2005 and 2007. A collegiate baseball league, the National Capital City Junior League, was renamed in honor of Griffith after his death. The league suspended operations in 2010.
