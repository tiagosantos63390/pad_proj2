Canon Ivan Corea died in Madampe in 1968. He will always be remembered as a priest who championed the rights of the poor in Sri Lanka. Among those who paid their respects at his funeral in Maha Nuge Gardens, Colombo were the Governor-General of Ceylon William Gopallawa, the Prime Minister of Ceylon Dudley Senanayake and the Finance Minister Junius Richard Jayewardene. The funeral service was led by the first ever Sri Lankan Anglican Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Harold De Soyza. The "Ceylon Daily News" of 1968 noted: "The Rt. Reverend Harold De Soysa, Bishop of Colombo paid tribute to the late Canon Corea referring to his ministry of loving service and made particular reference to his work on the history of the Diocese of Colombo." At the time of his death, Canon Corea was editing a revised version of "A History of the Church of Ceylon".
