Aneuploidy, a condition in which non-disjunction gives rise to gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one of the most prevalent phenotypes of human tumors. The underlying cause of aneuploidy remains highly debated; however, entosis is shown to perturb cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division) and trigger the formation of aneuploid cells. This would be in line with past research, as cell-in-cell structures have been widely observed in the focused study of many human tumors, including lung, breast, and endometrial stromal carcinomas. 
The "Brin"-class submarines were five Italian submarines that served in the Regia Marina during World War II. All ships were built by Tosi. Two boats were replacements for "Archimede"-class submarines secretly transferred to the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War in 1937. The class were partially double hulled. The deck gun was initially mounted in the conning tower (to enable surface action during Indian ocean Monsoon). The gun was re-sited on the forward deck later in the war in surviving boats and the large conning tower was re-built to a smaller design.
