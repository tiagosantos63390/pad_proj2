Analysis of gene ontology information by BioGPS database and IntAct database. The two interactions with the highest confidence value are also supported by materials found by text-mining in STRING. Together, it is with reasonably high confidence that the proteins in red are interacting with MEGF8, and with moderate confidence that the proteins in green interact with MEGF8. The confidence level for the proteins in blue is much lower, which may mean that the two-hybrid assay provided a false positive, or that they actually are interacting.
The sculpture was commissioned for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (1905) by the Committee of Portland Women, who requested a sculpture of "the only woman in the Lewis and Clark Expedition and in honor of the pioneer mother of old Oregon." Funding sources included the Port of Portland and Women for Lewis and Clark Exposition, which was supported by women across the Western United States. The sculpture was unveiled on July 6, 1905 and originally stood in the center of the exposition's plaza. Suffragists present at the dedication included Susan B. Anthony, Abigail Scott Duniway and Anna Howard Shaw. The statue was relocated to Washington Park on April 6, 1906, upon the fair's completion. According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, which administers the sculpture, Cooper was the first female artist to be represented in Portland's public sculpture collection.
