Toll arrived at Bennett Island on 21 July 1902 facing a dilemma: set a basecamp and engage in hunting to replenish his food supplies, or rely on the arrival of "Zarya" and proceed with explorations.

On 26 October 1902, the Toll's group headed south.

Mr. Jingles, a serial killer and the co-host of a children's television series, abducts the Nelson family, and forces nine year-old Angela to watch as he films himself murdering her parents, and sister. The police arrive in time to save Angela, and they arrest Jingles, though the sheriff is so disgusted by the clown's actions that he executes Jingles. The seemingly dead Jingles is thrown into the trunk of a police cruiser, but as Angela is led away, he winks at her. The next day, the deputies who were going to dispose of Jingles are found butchered, and Jingles is assumed to have drowned in a pit while making his escape.
