Kushnier's second album "Jeremy Kushnier" in 2006 (produced by Jonathan Dinklage) is a more grounded look at life through clearer glasses. This EP conceived and produced with his friend and musical director Jonathan Dinklage is an acoustic blend of rock and pop that gleans its inspiration from an era of analog tape and tube warmth. A time when one good take could make an album. This album was recorded with a group of musicians with the feel and talent to pull this inspiration together in a truly creative and original way. There is an honesty in this recording that keeps it grounded without taking itself too seriously. Jeremy's writing continues to fuse his love of singer songwriters with his self-proclaimed pop addiction. From the moody Allison to the B52's-esque Lullaby this follow up to his first release "In Time" is sure to leave you wanting more.
