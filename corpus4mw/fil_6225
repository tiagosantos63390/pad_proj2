There are many things that set Loveland Derby apart from other competitions. It is the biggest race with around 600 competitors while other races only have around 150 competitors. Also, there are five separate slalom courses, three of which run concurrently while at normal races there are only two slalom courses. April 14-15, 2012 will mark the 52nd year of The Derby, which makes it the oldest ski race in North America. Another thing that distinguishes the Loveland Derby is that it is raced so late in the ski season and there is such a festive atmosphere around the race.

As in APCC where the Junior Ambassadors get to participate in various activities, these children also get such opportunities to establish and strengthen their friendships.
