History.

Jes Holtsø (born 30 December 1956) is a Danish actor most notable for his role as Kjeld's son Børge in the Olsen Gang films. The reason that he was chosen to play Børge was actually his thick glasses, which became his characteristic. Later he played the Olsens' son, William Olsen in the Danish television series Huset på Christianshavn from 1970 to 1977 and the film based on the series Ballade på Christianshavn in 1971. As an adult Jes never pursued acting, though he did take part in the last Olsen Gang film, "Olsen Bandens sidste stik", as the adult Børge.

One can drive on the blackness as though it were solid ground, and dust or steam appears when the player brakes.

A single, incomplete dominant gene ("Lp") controls the presence of leopard-spotting in horses. A dominant gene requires only a single copy to produce an affected phenotype; an incomplete dominant gene produces a different result depending on whether one or two copies are present. A horse's genotype may be "lp/lp" (homozygous recessive), "Lp/lp" (heterozygous), or "Lp/Lp" (homozygous dominant). Horses without a dominant "Lp" gene do not exhibit leopard-complex traits, and cannot produce offspring with the "Lp" gene unless it is contributed by the other parent. Such horses are termed "non-characteristic" among Appaloosa horse aficionados. Horses with at least one "Lp" gene possess, at the very least, leopard-complex "characteristics":
