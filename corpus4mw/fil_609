The sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added.
A matroid may be defined as a family of finite sets (called the "independent sets" of the matroid) that is closed under subsets and that satisfies the "exchange property": if sets formula_1 and formula_2 are both independent, and formula_1 is larger than formula_2, then there is an element formula_5 such that formula_6 remains independent. If formula_7 is an undirected graph, and formula_8 is the family of sets of edges that form forests in formula_7, then formula_8 is clearly closed under subsets (removing edges from a forest leaves another forest). It also satisfies the exchange property: if formula_1 and formula_2 are both forests, and formula_1 has more edges than formula_2, then it has fewer connected components, so by the pigeonhole principle there is a component formula_15 of formula_1 that contains vertices from two or more components of formula_2. Along any path in formula_15 from a vertex in one component of formula_2 to a vertex of another component, there must be an edge with endpoints in two components, and this edge may be added to formula_2 to produce a forest with more edges. Thus, formula_8 forms the independent sets of a matroid, called the graphic matroid of formula_7 or formula_23. More generally, a matroid is called graphic whenever it is isomorphic to the graphic matroid of a graph, regardless of whether its elements are themselves edges in a graph.

As a member of the Slovene minority in Italy Franko Luin was not a Slovene or Yugoslav citizen; nevertheless, he was proud of his roots and kept close contact with his family and with Slovenian authors.
Sandby designed a carved oak altar-screen for St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and a stone bridge over the Thames at Staines, opened in 1796, but removed a few years afterwards on account of its insecurity. He built several houses in the neighbourhood of Windsor, including St Leonard's Hill for the Duchess of Gloucester, and one for a Colonel Deacon, later known as "Holly Grove". Designs exist for many others of his architectural works which cannot now be identified. In 1777 he was appointed, jointly with James Adam, architect of his majesty's works, and in 1780 master-carpenter of the his majesty's works in England.
The first known imprint of the press is John D. Rockefeller's "Random Reminiscences of Men and Events." In the earliest years, M&S concentrated primarily on exclusive distribution and printing agreements with foreign-owned publishing houses. But the company did feature home-grown authors alongside their foreign offerings - the second catalogue issued by the company was titled "Canadiana: A list of Books on Canada and Canadian Questions, Books by Canadian Writers."
The Amería River divides the municipality into two regions. The west is more rugged with the Cerro Grande and the Sierra de Manatlán. The southeast is more level as it is part of the Valley of Colima. The two volcanos form part of the municipality’s and state’s northern border. Other rivers and streams in the municipality include Zacualpan, San Antonio, Los Mezcales, La Caja, San Juan, Nogueras and the Comala River tributaries Reynosa, Suchtlán and Barragana. There are also lakes called Carrizalillos, La Joya, El Obispo, Palo Alto, Las cuatas, El Calabozo, El Epazote, La Escondida, El Jabalí and La María. The Peñitas Dam was constructed in Comala in 1963 to provide water for the municipalities of Colima, Comala, Coquimatlán and Villa de Alvarez. Today the reservoir covers 10,217 hectares and fed by the Armería River.

III Marine Expeditionary Foce was activated as I Amphibious Corps Oct. 1, 1942 in Camp Elliott, San Diego, Calif. Later that month, they were deployed to Noumea, New Caledonia. The unit was redesignated as III Amphibious Corps April 15, 1944. III Amphibious Corps was deactivated June 10, 1946.
In 1816 Dubourg paid their passage to America and they sailed to in Baltimore, Maryland, then traveled by flatboat to Bardstown, Kentucky, where they were welcomed by the local bishop, Benedict Joseph Flaget. The two Italians taught theology at St. Thomas Seminary there, while they perfected their knowledge of the English language and adapted to life on the new continent. Dubourg himself returned to the United States on 4 September 1817, accompanied by a large group of priests and religious Order members, also landing in Baltimore. From there he sent a request to Flaget that he accompany the two Vincentian priests to St. Louis to prepare the groups' arrival.

Betty Jo was portrayed by Paul Henning's daughter, Linda Kaye Henning (billed as Linda Kaye for the first five seasons) for the entire run. However, the actresses portraying her sisters changed over the years. Billie Jo was originally going to be played by Sharon Tate; however, CBS decided not to use her when she posed scantily clad for some photos. There was a cast photo taken with Sharon Tate, but she was replaced just before the show began. Billie Jo was played for the first two years (1963–1965) by Jeannine Riley, who left to pursue a movie career; in season three (1965–1966), to be replaced by Gunilla Hutton; and for the rest of the show's run (1966–1970) by Meredith MacRae. Bobbie Jo was played in the first two years (1963–1965, but absent some episodes) by Pat Woodell, who left the series to start a singing career, and then (1965–1970) by Lori Saunders. (Woodell and Saunders resembled each other physically, but the character of Bobbie Jo was gradually revamped after the cast change, going from shy bookworm to humorous scatterbrain.) In Pat Woodell's absence, Bobbie Jo was partially played by a double - who did not show her face - in two episodes. The only cast members who were in all seasons were Edgar Buchanan, Linda Kaye Henning and Frank Cady; Buchanan was the only one to appear in every episode, with Henning appearing in all but one.

The library contains mainly old books in manuscript chained to their places, some of them fine specimens of ancient handwriting, containing beautiful illustrations in gold and colour. Two of the most valuable are a unique copy of the ancient Hereford antiphonary of the 13th century, in good preservation, and the Hereford Gospels, a copy of the Gospels at least a thousand years old, in Anglo-Saxon characters. Another treasure is an ancient reliquary of oak, bequeathed to the cathedral by Canon Russell, who is said to have obtained it from a Roman Catholic family in whose possession it had long been. It is covered with copper plates overlaid with Limoges enamel representing the murder and entombment of St. Thomas of Canterbury.

Robert Connolly, director of the 2009 film, said, "It's quite clear the journalists were murdered. The current Indonesian and Australian (government) point of view, that they were killed in crossfire, is quite frankly absurd. We seek out war criminals from World War II, so to dismiss calls for justice for the Balibo Five is crazy."
The "EX" module code stands for "extension", as the adventure is designed to be inserted as an independent addition to another, ongoing scenario. In Gygax's own campaign, an early version of "Dungeonland" was an extension of Castle Greyhawk. In this module, the player characters (PCs) are plummeted into what "White Dwarf" reviewer Jim Bambra referred to as "a strange partial plane".

The series initially ran for 13 episodes from September to December 1960, returning the following year with Bernard Bresslaw and Hylda Baker as Henrietta added to the cast. Of the 39 episodes transmitted, only three survive today.

O'Driscoll made his debut for Leinster in 1999, and under head coach Matt Williams and backs coach Alan Gaffney he became an explosive force in the Leinster backline, forming a highly effective centre partnership with Shane Horgan. In 2001, Leinster won the inaugural Celtic League beating Munster in Lansdowne Road. In 2003, Leinster were heavy favourites for that year's Heineken Cup but were beaten by Perpignan in the semi finals.

The group took either direct responsibility or the blame for many of the early Iraqi insurgent attacks, including the series of high-profile bombings in August 2003, which killed 17 people at the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad, 23 people, including the chief of the United Nations Mission to Iraq Sérgio Vieira de Mello, at the UN headquarters in Baghdad, and at least 86 people, including Ayatollah Sayed Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim, in the Imam Ali Mosque bombing in Najaf, and 27 people, mostly Italian paramilitary policemen, in the November 2003 truck bombing at the Italian base in Nasiriyah.
The range is a fault block of granitic rocks squeezed between the San Jacinto fault on the west and the San Andreas fault system on the east. The fault escarpment on the northern and eastern side is one of the most abrupt in North America, going from sea level to 10,000 feet in a few miles. The height and steepness of the range points out that the San Jacinto fault and San Andreas fault are very active and very capable of producing major earthquakes (well in excess of magnitude 7). The last massive quake struck the southern segment of the San Andreas-San Jacinto fault complex more than 200 years ago, so the area is probably overdue for a major earthquake, although it is impossible to pinpoint the date. Rock slides from the range are possible during major earthquakes in the future, as they have been in the past. These slides may potentially impact the communities built directly adjacent to the steep escarpment on the desert side of the range.
The area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Nipton has a mild desert climate, abbreviated "Bwh" on climate maps.
National Express decided not to withdraw the fleet of coaches to conduct tests. It was deemed that there were no faults with the vehicles, leaving the cause of the crash to driver error.
