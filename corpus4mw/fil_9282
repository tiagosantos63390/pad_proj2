Around the sixteenth century, the Palace on the Way (or, "on the Road") was one of the most prominent noble residences in the area of Kleparz within the jurisdiction of Szlak. Originally completed in 1613 for the Montelupi merchant family of the Italian background, the Palace was purchased by the Jesuit Order in 1639; than by the Badeni family in 1773; and the Tarnowskis, in the 19th century. It was refurbished and expanded in 1878 during the foreign partitions of Poland by renown local architect Antoni ≈Åuszczkiewicz.
