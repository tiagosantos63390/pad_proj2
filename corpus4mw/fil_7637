The Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant receives water from Lake Tana where it is transferred to a power station and then discharged through another tunnel and into the Beles River. This is first accomplished by an inlet on Lake Tana, where the power station can utilize of the lake's volume for power production. The inlet channel is wide, high and its flow into the headrace tunnel is controlled by five floodgates. The headrace tunnel transfers the water to the southwest along its length within its diameter of . At the end of the headrace tunnel, it converts into a diameter and long penstock before reaching the power station. At the power station, water is delivered to four Francis turbines powering four 115 MW generators. The power station is an underground cavern type and is long, high and wide. It has a deep and diameter surge shaft as well. Once the water is used in hydroelectric production it is then discharged from the power station to the Beles River via a tailrace tunnel with the same diameter as the headrace. Normal water level at the inlet is above sea level and the power station resides at , allowing for of hydraulic head. The project is also expected to help irrigate in the future as well.
