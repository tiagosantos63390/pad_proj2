Ulft's painting of the old city hall of Amsterdam shows the whalebone hanging from the "vierschaar" (courtroom) given to the city by Willem Barentsz. A similar whalebone still hangs in the Haarlem City Hall. This painting, highly detailed and populated with townspeople in all manner of dress and occupation, was enough to keep his name famous for centuries, according to Houbraken.
