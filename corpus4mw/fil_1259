Many nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous "Boy", "Toto/Totoy" (young boy), "Girlie", "Nene" (young girl), "Baby" and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called "Boy" or "Baby" even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as "Pepito" for "Pepe", "Juanito" for "Juan" (or the English form "Johnny" for "John"), and "Nenita" for "Nena". Thus, a person used to being called "Joselito" ("Little Joseph") as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called "José" or "Joseph".

At the hospital with Father Tom, Dom receives a phone call from Angela saying that she has Karen's crucifix and is in hiding. They agree to meet at an abandoned building.

Dom awakens and sees that the killer is in fact Mrs. Tredoni. She killed Karen because she believes that "children pay for the sins of the parents."
