She became a member of the Children, a psychedelic outfit that was part of Lelan Rodgers' stable of artists, appearing on their 1968 Rebirth album and several singles. She later joined Saddlesore, a Texas combo whose core members, Mayo Thompson and Rick Barthelme, were survivors from the Red Krayola (another Rodgers-managed act). They stayed together long enough to record one single ("Old Tom Clark") on the Texas Revolution label before disappearing in the early '70s.

Playing career.
The architect responsible for directing and planning this structure of historicist influence was Luis Andreoni, also responsible for the foundation of the Estaci√≥n Central General Artigas and the Club Uruguay. He is based on a procedure as much artistic as scientific in accuracy, characteristic of an era in with scarce economic resources. In this sense, the Italian hospital is one of the first representatives of progressive art in Uruguay, of a simplistic and objective trait, that was the opposite of the subjectivity and decorum that had characterized the earlier stages, which were seeing slight revival in the building of the Palacio Legislativo of Montevideo, also by Italian architects, in 1925.
