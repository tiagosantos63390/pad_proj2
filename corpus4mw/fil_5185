After the death of Bishop McMullen, Cosgrove was named administrator of the see. His name was not on the terna that was sent to the Holy See for Davenport's new bishop. There were still resentments about Davenport as a see city instead of Des Moines and its supporters saw an opportunity. Father Trevis, who championed Davenport as the see city and had friends at the Holy See, interceded and suggested no appointment be made until the clergy of the diocese had their say. The clergy desired one of their own as bishop, and chose Cosgrove. A petition was sent to Rome. Henry Cosgrove was appointed the second bishop of Davenport on July 11, 1884 by Pope Leo XIII, and was consecrated in St. Margaret's Cathedral on September 14, 1884 by Archbishop Patrick Feehan of Chicago. Bishops John Hennessy of Dubuque and James O'Connor, the Vicar Apostolic of Nebraska, were the principal co-consecrators.
