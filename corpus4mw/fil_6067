In 1989 Wilkie defeated Goblin and attained the alpha position. Wilkie, attained this position despite being one of the smallest males in the community, at . According to researchers at the University of Minnesota's Jane Goodall Institute Center for Primate Studies, Wilkie attained his position primarily by becoming popular by obsessively grooming other males. Unlike most males, Wilkie also groomed females. Wilkie was overthrown in 1992 by his childhood playmate Freud, who was in turn deposed by his brother Frodo in 1997 while Freud was ill. Freud, at , was larger than Wilkie and relied on a mixture of moderate force and grooming to become alpha and maintain his stautus. Frodo, at , was one of the largest males ever seen in the group, relied primarily on brute force to attain and maintain alpha status. After Frodo became ill in 2002, he was brutally beaten by a coalition of males led by Sheldon and spent two years traveling away from the rest of the community. No chimpanzee was able to establish himself as an alpha male until 2004. Sheldon briefly held the top-ranking male position in 2004, but by 2005 Kris had defeated all competitors, including Frodo, and established himself as the unambiguous alpha male. In 2008, Kris was supplanted as alpha male by Ferdinand, the youngest surviving brother of Freud and Frodo. As of 2013, Ferdinand is the alpha male of the community.

The Frobenius normal "p"-complement theorem shows that if every normalizer of a non-trivial subgroup of a Sylow "p"-subgroup has a normal "p"-complement then so does "G". For applications it is often useful to have a stronger version where instead of using all non-trivial subgroups of a Sylow "p"-subgroup, one uses only the non-trivial characteristic subgroups. For odd primes "p" Thompson found such a strengthened criterion: in fact he did not need all characteristic subgroups, but only two special ones. 

During the week of July 4, 1964, the group's cover version of The Beatles's song "All My Loving" spent a single week on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at No. 93.
