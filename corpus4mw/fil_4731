H.J. Lutz's study of Hearts Content was one of the earliest quantitative analyses of plant communities in an old-growth forest, and it remains influential in the field of ecology. Lutz concluded that the even-aged white pine stand established following a major disturbance about 350 years ago, such as a fire; since then, the species has not reproduced under the closed canopy. By relocating and resampling Lutz's original plots, Whitney documented 50 years of changes in the structure and composition of the stand. During this time, dense deer populations have reduced the regeneration of many tree and herb species.

After a long delay, caused by disagreements with the small label the band had signed with, Sorta released 2006's "Strange and Sad but True". It was well received by both critics, and fans alike, as it was listed at #7 in the "Local Favorites" section of the October 7, 2007 issue of "Rolling Stone Magazine", landing just ahead of Wilco, and just behind The White Stripes on the chart. The band was honored as "Best Act in Town" by the "Observer" in 2006, following a run that saw Liz Phair pick one of their songs in 2004, and shows such as Grey's Anatomy use their work as well. In 2007, Holt was honored again as Musician of the Year.
