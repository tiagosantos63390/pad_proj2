The MBED works in two aspects: 
Liu Ming-ch'uan was aware that Keelung and the nearby port of Tamsui (淡水) were likely targets for a French attack, and made sensible defensive dispositions to oppose a landing at both towns. He stationed 2,500 Chinese troops around Keelung, the likeliest target, under the command of the generals Sun K'ai-hua (孫開華) and Su Te-sheng (蘇得勝), while he himself remained with the other half of his army at Tai-pak-fu (台北府, modern Taipei, 台北), occupying a central position that would allow him to move quickly either to Tamsui or to Keelung once the French threat developed.

Despite playing regularly for the national team for several years, he did not participate in any major tournament: in 1990, he was not selected for the final stages in Italy, and missed UEFA Euro 1992 (with CIS) and 1996 due to injury.
