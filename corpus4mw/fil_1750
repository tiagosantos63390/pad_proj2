History.
Consider a point formula_2. There is a unique polynomial "fp" in "k" variables and of order "m" such that "p" is in the image of "jmfp". That is, formula_3. The differential data "x′" may be transferred to lie over another point "y" ∈ R"n" as "jmfp(y)" , the partials of "fp" over "y". 
The marquee element was first invented for Microsoft's Internet Explorer and is still supported by it. Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari web browsers support it for compatibility with legacy pages. The element is non-compliant HTML. CSS properties are used to achieve the same effect as specified in the Marquee Module Level 3, which as of 2008 is in the call for implementations stage. Similar effects can also be achieved through the use of JavaScript, or CSS3 animations.

The Technology Center was opened in 2002. The facility integrates technology, science, mathematics and engineering in its curriculum, with a student testing and reporting (STAR) Lab and the infrastructure for more than 1000 computers. The Technology Center includes a television production center with six edit labs, audio/video production rooms, a television studio with a 25' electronic screen, two project rooms for desktop publishing, four classrooms designated for digital photography, robots, engineering and communications, and specialty math and science labs. High-tech firms with local offices, including Sun Microsystems and AT&T/Comcast, were involved in the planning.
The Ganesha temple is located in Cave 7, the largest excavation around Junnar, about above the plains. It is essentially a Buddhist "Vihara" (a dwelling for monks, mostly with meditation cells) in design, an unpillared hall with 20 cells with varying dimensions; 7 on either side and 6 on the rear wall. The hall is large, can be entered by a central door, under a pillared veranda. The hall is long; wide and high. There are 2 windows on either side of the entrance. The hall is treated now as a sabha-mandapa ("assembly hall") of the Ganesha temple. 283 steps built (by devotees) in stone masonry over eight flights lead to the entrance. The steps are believed to represent sensual pleasures, which Ganesha has overcome. The veranda has six pillars and two pilasters (half-pillars), that support "an architrave from which projects eaves relieved with a railing resting on beams and rafters". The pillars have octagonal shafts and "over benches and back rest and topped by an inverted "ghata", compressed "amalaka" in between two square plates, inverted stepped pyramid and finally crowned by a bracket" with tigers, elephants and bulls.
The modern Turkish term "kaymakam" originally comes from two originally Arabic words as used in Ottoman Turkish: "kâim" (قائم), meaning "standing"; and "makâm" (مقام), originally used for "place" but, in this context, used with the sense of "office", "position", or "state". Thus, in Ottoman times, a "kâim-makâm" was a state officer who was considered a representative of, or "standing in place" of the sultan at a local level; today, a "kaymakam" is a representative of the government or state at a local level.
