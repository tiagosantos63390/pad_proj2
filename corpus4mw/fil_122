Demographics.
The first known settlement of Jacob City was by a white man named Jacob Jones, who housed the first blacks on his land and property, that is where Jacob City got its name, as they would tell their friends "lets go to Jacob's." As blacks arrived to escape oppression, they moved farther down and made horse wagon trails into dirt roads forming a small community. By the mid-19th century, the small town of Jacob was Jackson County's first black community. Blacks started their own store, but the owner was murdered and the store was never re-opened. By the late 19th century, St. Mary Missionary Baptist church was built on what is now Main Street and is commemorated by a Jacob City historical marker. By the early 20th century, Jacob's dirt roads were improved and its population rose, but the poverty level was high due to the lack of education as there was no school for black children.
