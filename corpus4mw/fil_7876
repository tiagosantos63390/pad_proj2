Several critics were complimentary about his acting and directing. In reference to his lead role; Mark Boosey (The British Comedy Guide editor) wrote “This monstrous egocentric 'plonker' carries many of the film's best lines and set pieces, and is played very well by the film's creator, Mark Noyce”. Britflicks critic Zachary Cooke said “films that are starring, written and directed by the same person are usually a no no, with On The Ropes this is not the case”. Richard Cross of A Full Tank of Gas stated “On the Ropes is one of those films that succeeds in spite of the nature of the British film industry and its financing rather than because of it, and Noyce is to be congratulated simply for getting the film made. That he also provides the audience with a high quality of comic entertainment is an unexpected bonus”.
