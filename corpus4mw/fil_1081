During the "Blackest Night" storyline, the body of the deceased Earth-Two Superman is turned into a Black Lantern, and goes on a killing spree through Smallville, culminating with the abduction of Pa's coffin from his grave, and the kidnapping of Ma by the Black Lantern Lois Lane of Earth-Two. The Earth-Two Superman declares that Ma and Pa will soon be back in each other's arms. While Conner and Clark deal with Earth-Two Superman, Martha is left to deal with the Black Lantern Lois, who chases Martha into the cornfield. However, Martha fights back against Black Lantern Lois, with the help of Krypto. Together, the two of them light the cornfield on fire, and Krypto temporarily severs Lois' connection to the Black Lantern Ring, allowing for Martha to survive.

The eastern hare-wallaby ("Lagorchestes leporides") once also known as the common hare wallaby, is an extinct species of wallaby that was native to southeastern Australia. It was first described by John Gould in 1841.
In his 1918 revision of North American "Oryzomys", Goldman considered "O. nelsoni" to be most closely related to the nearest mainland subspecies of "O. couesi", "O. couesi mexicanus". In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the "Oryzomys" of western Mexico and confirmed that "O. nelsoni" is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and "Oryzomys albiventer" of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although "O. nelsoni" likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with "O. albiventer".

Relationships with the other Thunderbolts.
The kava is served in rounds. Typically the toua will first stir the kava in the "kumete", then pour some in the "ipu" (coconut cups) which are then passed from hand to hand to those sitting farthest away. They drink, and the empty cups are returned again from hand to hand. Everybody remains seated, cross-legged, although one is allowed to stretch the legs from time to time. Meanwhile the toua has filled other cups for those next from the farthest away, and so the drinking goes forth until those nearest to the "kumete" have had their drink too. Then the men talk again (about politics, sports, tradition & culture, jokes, or anything else) or they will sing a traditional love song, often accompanied by guitar. Some now-famous string bands have had their origin at a "faikava". Finally the next drinking round starts.
