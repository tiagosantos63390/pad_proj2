'A' phrase, with repeat:
We can realize God with an evolved mind - mind that has developed the capability to see the substrate over which grows the matter. Since this needs mental evolution to understand what is beyond five senses, this process of mental awakening cannot be documented and neither can be spoken. This needs union with human personality who himself is awakened. He, who is awakened to this supreme consciousness, can take our mind beyond five senses to realize the Truth. A True Master does it instantly – by making you experience his experience. This does not need any religious practices. God’s knowledge cannot have anything to do with any of these, because God is so simple that we stumble over its simplicity – True Master makes us experience this simplicity. We need to understand that God cannot be complicated. God is simple and simple is divine.

Upon the album's release in early April 1962 in both mono and stereo format, a reviewer for "Billboard" magazine claimed that "In addition to being powerful dealer material, this package will fracture knowledgeable jockeys who will find in it a wealth of material to talk about as well as play." By mid-April, reports of the album's sales and radio airplay had started coming in from cities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of "Modern Sounds" replaced the "West Side Story" soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it off the top of the "Billboard" Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, "Born to Lose", "Careless Love", "I Can't Stop Loving You" and "You Don't Know Me", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The hit singles quickly gained a significant amount of radio airplay on both country and R&B stations. By mid-May, the album's lead single, "I Can't Stop Loving You", had sold 700,000 copies within its first four weeks of release. Record dealers began describing the album as "equal in sales action to some of the early Presley disks" and, after moving 400,000 copies of the single, influential Atlanta record distributor Gwen Kestler told "Billboard" magazine that "the record is so hot in her district that people who don't even own record players are buying it." "I Can't Stop Loving You" hit number one on the "Billboard" Pop Singles chart on June 2, spending five consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. By the time it fell off the top, the single was reported to have reached nearly a million-and-a-half sales, moving over 100,000 copies per week.
