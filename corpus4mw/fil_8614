SR 464 begins on the southeast side of State Road 200, across from the intersection of Southwest 20th Court as Southwest 17th Street. The road runs southeast but immediately curves to the east before intersecting Southwest 19th Avenue Road. From there it continues its straight eastern trek as it approaches the newly constructed Railroad bridge over Southwest 7th Road and Avenue at the CSX Wildwood Subdivision, part of the CSX S-Line. After leveling out from the new bridge, the road intersects U.S. 27-301-441.
Snell was among several young guards battling for playing time going into the season, as senior and three-year starter Phillip McDonald was hampered by injury. Snell earned a starting spot after "tearing it up in practice" and playing well in preseason exhibition games. He was capable of explosive scoring, but he was also prone to becoming tentative and falling into slumps. He scored in double-figures in twenty games, including three games over 20, twice scoring 24, hitting six threes in one of those games; yet he also scored six or fewer points in eleven games, going scoreless for two straight games at one point. For the season, Snell averaged 10.5 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists a game.
