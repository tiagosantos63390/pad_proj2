Bishop Hill has come to public attention several times. In November 2009, "Daily Telegraph" blogger James Delingpole credited Bishop Hill with reporting the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funding of the Climate Outreach and Information Network charity in the amount of £700,000 over two years. Also in February 2010, Philip Campbell, the editor-in-chief of "Nature", resigned from Sir Muir Russell's Independent Climate Change Email Review after Bishop Hill and Channel 4 News drew attention to an interview Campbell had given in 2009 to China Radio International, in which he said there was no evidence the scientists had engaged in a coverup.

Etymology.
Admon (, or as cited in one of the Baraitas as: אדמון בן גדאי, ""Admon ben Gaddai"") was a Jewish Tanna sage, and chief dayan (religious judge) on the three police-court judges in Jerusalem during the latter end of the era of the Second Temple of Jerusalem and the times preceding the fall of Jerusalem, and during the times of the end of the era of the Zugot sages and the beginning of the era of the Tannaim. The Mishnah cites seven religious controversies he had with other Jewish sages. One of the Baraitas cites his full name: "Admon ben Gaddai".

French Canadian and metis trappers and missionaries arrived in the eastern part of the state in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many having travelled as members of Lewis and Clark and the 1811 Astor expeditions. Some stayed permanently, including Étienne Lussier, believed to be the first European farmer in the state of Oregon. The evidence of this French Canadian presence can be found in the numerous names of French origin in that part of the state, including Malheur Lake and the Malheur River, the Grande Ronde and Deschutes rivers, and the city of La Grande.

The Tourist Police, usually stationed at Patpong 1 and Silom Road, can help in these situations.
