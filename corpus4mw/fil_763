Work was finally completed in September 1934, and the Shrine was formally dedicated on 11 November 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester, witnessed by a crowd of over 300,000 people—a "massive turnout" given that Melbourne's population at the time was approximately 1 million, and, according to Carl Bridge, the "largest crowd ever to assemble in Australia to that date".

In November 2012, the Tolkien Estate, trustee and publishers sued Middle-earth Enterprises, Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema for infringing Tolkien's copyrights by producing casino and video games using his characters. The original license to Tolkien's works was limited to the right to sell "tangible" products such as "figurines, tableware, stationery items, clothing, and the like", but did not cover "electronic or digital rights, rights in media yet to be devised or other intangibles such as rights in services". Tolkien's estate claimed that the defendants actions had caused "irreparable harm to Tolkien's legacy".

Each sub-section of a lair contains a number of clue bottles which, when collected, allow Sly to access a safe in the level that contains a page from the Thievius Raccoonus. These pages grant Sly new moves to aid in movement, stealth, or combat, such as creating a decoy or dropping an explosive hat. Defeating each of the bosses also gives Sly moves, and these abilities are typically necessary to pass later levels. Coins are scattered about the levels and are also generated by defeating enemies or destroying objects. For every 100 coins collected, Sly gains a lucky horseshoe that is the color blue and when you have two horseshoes, it turns gold. It will allow him to take extra hits, or if he currently has one, an extra life. If Sly collapses and loses a life, the current sub-level will be restarted or at a special "repeater" that acts as a checkpoint; if the player loses all of Sly's lives, they must restart that bosses' lair from the beginning. Besides the regular gameplay, there are mini-games that include driving levels (based on Murray), shooting levels to protect Murray as he ascends certain levels, and a cyber-tank game representing a hacking attempt by Bentley. One notable boss battle includes a rhythm-based sequence similar to "Dance Dance Revolution".

In all over the subcontinent, the British government took over the state machinery, bureaucracy, universities, schools, and institutions as well establishing its own. During this time, Lord Macaulay radical and influential educational reforms led to the numerous changes to the introduction and teaching of Western languages (e.g. English and Latin), history, and philosophy. Religious studies, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages were completely barred from the state universities. In a short span of time, the English language had became not only the medium of instruction but also the official language in 1835 in place of Persian, disadvantaging those who had built their careers around the latter language.

The latter term, which means "ten thousand years," is an expression of Chinese origin (万歳) adopted by the Japanese in the Meiji period. In its original sense, it is meant to represent an indeterminably lengthy time and is used to wish long life to a person, state, or project. As co-opted by the Japanese, it originally was simply used in this sense to wish long life to the Emperor (and by extension the Japanese state). As the war progressed, it became the typical Japanese war cry or victory shout and was used to encourage Imperial troops in combat.

Kalyani biryani is a typical biryani from Hyderabad. Also known as the 'poor man's Hyderabadi biryani, the Kalyani biryani is always made from small cubes of buffalo meat. It doesn't have the same level of expensive ingredients and richness as the more famous Hyderabadi biryani, but at the same time, is quite tasty.
Welles insisted his Mercury company — actors and crew — be involved in the radio series. This was an unprecedented and expensive request, especially for one so young as Welles. Most episodes dramatized works of classic and contemporary literature. It remains perhaps the most highly regarded radio drama anthology series ever broadcast, most likely due to the creativity of Orson Welles.
The "Fatal Fury" character Raiden, also known as "Big Bear", is based on Vader's appearance in Japan. The character Alexander the Grater from "Saturday Night Slam Masters" bears a resemblance to Vader. Alexander also wears a mask very similar to the mastodon mask Vader would wear during ring entrances in the 1980s and early 1990s. Vader himself appears as a playable character in the WCW video games "WCW Wrestling", "", and "WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling", the WWE video game "WWF In Your House", and as a downloadable or unlockable legend in "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009", "WWE '12", and "WWE '13". As well as being featured in numerous Japanese wrestling games such as King of Colosseum (he is a preset model in King of Colosseum II's EDIT mode), as well as the latter two editions of the All Star Pro-Wrestling series, and Wrestle Kingdom 2 where he is also featured in the cover art.

In 1692, Thomas Tew obtained a letter of marque from the Governor of Bermuda. Various Bermudian backers provided him with a vessel: the seventy-ton sloop "Amity," armed with eight guns and crewed by forty-six officers and men. Thus equipped, Captain Tew, and several other ships, including one under the command of a Captain Dew set sail in December 1692, ostensibly to serve as a privateer against French holdings in The Gambia. Although not specifically stated as to who the overall commander of the small fleet was, Captain Tew was definitely not that fleet commander, but rather Captain Tew and most other ships sailed under the overall command of a higher officer. However, upon encountering a tropical storm, some ships were lost and others turned back to Bermuda; the outcome of the fleet commander was not stated, but it appears his ship may have gone down leading which lead to the remaining ships going in opposite directions. Without a fleet commander to over rule him, Captain Tew consulted his crew as to whether they too should turn back and also announced his desire and intention of turning to piracy should they continue. Asking the crew for their support since he could not enforce the illegal scheme without their consent, Tew's crew reportedly answered with the shout, "A gold chain or a wooden leg, we'll stand with you!" The newly minted pirates proceeded to elect a quartermaster, a common pirate practice to balance the captain's power.
