Ludwig Schunk did not have any children. His wife, who had collaborated very energetically in building up the company, had died early. The heirs of his deceased partner had been compensated so that he was sole owner of the corporate assets. As early as 1938 he decided in his will that those assets would be made available to the employees. He clarified this in a supplemental testament in 1942 and made the providential fund he had founded his sole heir. According to his own words, the example he was following was that of the Zeiss Foundation in Jena.

The first scene of "" depicts Oswald Danes surviving execution by lethal injection due to death spontaneously ceasing. His lawyers successfully advance a "force majeure" argument; as a result the Governor of Kentucky is reluctantly forced to release Danes on parole. Oswald accepts an offer of representation from PR guru Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) after his fame leads to him being assaulted in public, leading to him becoming a spokesman for Phicorp, a drug company hoping to capitalise on the absence of death. During Torchwood's investigations into PhiCorp, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) confronts Danes, who admits the falsity of his expressed remorse. Tensions arise between Kitzinger and Danes when he is eclipsed in the media by Tea Party politician Ellis Hartley Monroe (Mare Winningham) and her "Dead is Dead" campaign. Danes launches an "ad hoc" publicity stunt; a video of Danes holding and comforting a baby girl goes viral and results in Monroe's media attention waning. At the "Miracle Rally" held by PhiCorp in Los Angeles Danes gives an impassioned speech, stating his belief that humanity had evolved into "everlasting angels" and revels in the audience chanting his name.
