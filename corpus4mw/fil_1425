After 400 years of ruin, the restored chapel was opened on November 2, 2013. The West Church was packed with visitors awaiting the moment when the doors would be opened to the Galilee Chapel. The opening ceremony was marked by a speech and prayer from the Reverend Huw Butler, and the red ribbon was cut by Llantwit’s oldest resident, 94-year-old Gladys Kilby, in the presence of the youngest member of the community, Violet, just one day old! And art and music festival was also held, and the following day the chapel was rededicated at a service presided over by Dr. Barry Morgan, Archbishop of Wales; Phillip Morris, Archdeacon of Margam; Huw Butler, Rector of Llantwit Major; and John Webber, former Rector of Llantwit Major. A sermon was preached by Phillip Morris, and that evening a Songs of Praise service was held, featuring the soloist Charlotte Ellet from the Welsh National Opera.
