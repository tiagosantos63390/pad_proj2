The TIBEAN - series are floating or submerse plants. They consist of one or more upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, degassed water is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented.
