An emergent appeal in New Jersey must be filed as soon as possible upon the emergency issue arising. One must first determine which judge is assigned to emergent duty for the vicinage. A moving party must then complete and return an emergent intake sheet. If one is granted permission to pursue emergent relief, either a Notice of Motion for Leave to File an Interlocutory Appeal is filed or a Notice of Appeal, depending upon the relief sought and the procedural posture of the case. The moving party then follows the directive of the court or the procedures for either an appeal as of right an interlocutory appeal.
