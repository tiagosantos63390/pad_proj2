All species of the genus "Agelaia", including "A. vicina" lack the characteristic of actively recruiting nestmates to discovered sources of food. It appears the most effective foraging strategy for the genus is for individuals to scramble for food on their own. The reason behind this is that when foragers work at the individual level, they are able to exploit the resources in that area more quickly and efficiently than if they took time to recruit nest mates to that area or tried to defend the area from non-nestmates. By behaving as opportunistic, solitary foragers they regularly find untouched food patches and exploit them as rapidly as possible until they are driven out by predators. As a corollary, this means that individuals of the species do not maintain specific foraging territories.
