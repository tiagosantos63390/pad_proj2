My Life as a Poster by Indian filmmaker Shashwati Talukdar is a mockumentary of a stereotypical, tragic foreign teen's story about moving to a strange, new land. An Indian girl and her parents move to the United States after the mysterious death of her sister. The girl struggles to fit into her new school while her parents adapt to new jobs and lifestyles. The story covers all the bases of the immigrant's heartbreaking tale: not finding acceptance, the stubborn father versus the American boyfriend, the longing for home, etc. The film is shot with footage of different streets, buildings, windows and doors. Several pictures of Indian people also are shown during the narration. At the end, it is revealed that all of these pictures come from a Bollywood movie poster, revealing that the entire story is fictional.
