In its earliest days, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory already present on the four hectare (nearly 10 acre) plot which would eventually host the current campus. Reyes Sr. was appointed the first president of the University, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes commissioned Pablo Antonio, who would later be titled National Artist of the Philippines, to construct a building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor Reyes Hall, which would later house the library and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girlsâ€™ High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400.
