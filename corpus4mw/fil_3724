The second band was the Cubano Fiestas, who recorded the album "K. Frimpong and His Cubano Fiestas" in 1977 for the Ofori Brothers label. The album contained the track "Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'awu" for which Frimpong is best known.

The Heavenly type may not be fully gaited, although they often exhibit the Glide or "Indian Shuffle." They are often more heavily muscled and taller, resembling a larger version of the Royalty type. They have more angled pasterns and shoulders and more closely resemble warmblood horses. They are suitable for dressage, cross-country, and hunter jumper events. According to the Tiger Horse Association, "breeders are advised to use only the exceptional Gliders in future breeding experiments, and only with Royalty horses." As of 2011, Heavenly types exhibiting glider gaits will only be registered if one parent is a registered Royalty type.
