The Lions began their 2008 season at the Georgia Dome against the Atlanta Falcons. A pre-season poll on thespread.com said the Falcons (who finished 11–5 before losing in the Wild Card round of the playoffs), were less likely (dead last for that matter) to make the Super Bowl than the Lions. In the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as QB Matt Ryan completed a 62-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins, while RB Michael Turner scored twice; in which he ran a 66-yard TD run and then a 5-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Lions would respond when rookie RB Kevin Smith scored on a 3-yard TD run, while QB Jon Kitna completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams. However, in the third quarter, Atlanta continued its dominant start when kicker Jason Elam kicked a 50-yard field goal, while RB Jerious Norwood scored on a 10-yard TD run. Detroit would reply when Kitna hooked up with TE Casey FitzSimmons on a 1-yard TD pass. However, the Falcons sealed the win in the fourth quarter when Elam nailed a 25-yard field goal.

The word succade is most probably derived from the Latin "succidus", but according to others the name may have originated from the Hebrew word sukkah, the temporary booth that Jews build on the holiday of Sukkot. The citron, known in Hebrew as an "etrog", is one of the symbolic Four Species used on that holiday. After Sukkot, some Jews candy the "etrog" or make marmalade from it.
