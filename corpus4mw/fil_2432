Fisher has thousands of 1800s redwood forest logging artifacts like the removable teeth from an old circular saw blade, oxen shoes and photographs. Items among the thousands of artifacts, double iron shoes from oxen that hauled the logs, old radio batteries, an ebony-handled dinner knife, pulleys, a corner spool that guided cables in Purisima Canyon (part of the Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve), and hundreds of bottles, including an opium bottle.
