Inhibition of fusion is necessary to prevent spontaneous exocytosis of vesicles into the synapse. If a clamp does not hold synaptic vesicle pools stable and inhibit them from fusing, the potential for spontaneous firing and depletion of the vesicle pool is much greater. It is believed that the C-terminal domain of complexin is responsible for this inhibitory function. In several eukaryotic organisms, mutations to complexin were linked to dramatic increases in spontaneous exocytosis rates.
