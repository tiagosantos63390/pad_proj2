Helicopter Wing 64 was created on 1 October 2010 when the helicopters previously assigned to Air Transport Wing 62 formed a new unit. Until 1 January 2013 the wing flew predominantly Bell UH-1D which were to be replaced by helicopters of the type NH90. The first helicopter of the type NH90 was handed over to Helicopter Wing 64 on 21 October 2010, three weeks after the formation of the new unit. Initially, three NH90's were being tested at the air base with another five having been delivered by October 2012.
