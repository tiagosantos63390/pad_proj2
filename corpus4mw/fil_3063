Meanwhile, Arman Kharas and Flint, followed by Tasslehoff Burrfoot, enter the sacred valley of thanes to retrieve the Hammer of Kharas from the tomb of Kharas. Flint struggles internally over the fate of the Hammer, as it is needed to forge the legendary dragonlances, but can also unite the dwarven clans under one leader, putting to rest the risk of civil war developing in the kingdom. Retrieving the Hammer, Flint, Arman and Tasslehoff join the dwarven thanes in the Temple of the Stars, only to be attacked by draconian forces, allied with the Theiwar dwarves. The dwarven forces, supported by the disillusioned Daergar clan, overcome the invading draconians and, regaining the Hammer, the icon of their race, graciously provide the human refugees with shelter.
It is difficult to decide which period in the city's history to consider "Old Zagreb," as popular by Gjuro Szabo, an admirer of the Zagreb antiquities and a promoter of their conservation. Zagreb's origins are ancient and enveloped in the mists of legend in the absence manuscripts or sufficient archaeological finds from those times. It's much easier, therefore, to look at Zagreb's history. In that case, Old Zagreb was two settlements situated on two neighboring hills: Gradec (also known as Gornji Grad) and Kaptol, with the houses lying in the valley between them along the former Medveščak creek (today's Tkalčićeva Street) and those at the beginning of Vlaška Street III beneath the bishopric (later archbishopric).
Geography.

Johannes Hartlieb (c. 1410 – 18 May 1468) was a physician of Late Medieval Bavaria, probably of a family from Neuburg an der Donau. He was in the employment of Louis VII of Bavaria and Albert VI of Austria in the 1430s, and of Albert III of Bavaria from 1440, and of the latter's son Sigismund from 1456. 
Regardless of type, all mollusk shells should be collected using a standardized stratigraphic sampling strategy. Utilizing this type of strategy avoids the problem of ignoring the collection of smaller shells, an issue that can result from hand-picking. Once samples are collected, they must be sent to a laboratory to be air-dried. A standard weight is then collected for each sample. Each standardized sample is then placed in a plastic bowl (labeled with stratigraphic information) and covered with hot water. Shells float to the top and are skimmed off into a set of sieves, which separate the shells by size. After shells are removed from the soil, the soil should be covered in a solution of 70% hot water and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Once the mixture fizzes, it is passed through a set of sieves. Both the soil and shells are then placed in the drying oven. After cooling, shells are fully prepared for analysis and can be extracted from the sieves.
