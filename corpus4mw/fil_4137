As Islam is the state religion, the government provides financial support to Islamic establishments and enforces the Sunni form of Islam. State governments can impose Islamic law on Muslims, and the government will offer grants to private Muslim schools that allow a government-approved curriculum and supervision. The government also indirectly funds non-Islamic communities, although to a much smaller degree. The government generally does not interfere with the religious practices of non-Muslim communities. Public schools offer an Islamic religious instruction course which is compulsory for Muslim students, and non-Muslim students take a morals and ethics course.

Lancelot Andrewes (1555 – 25 September 1626) was an English priest and scholar, who held high positions in the Church of England during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. He was the spiritual father of Charles I. During the reign of King James I, Andrewes served as Bishop of Chichester and oversaw the translation of the "Authorized Version" (or "King James Version") of the Bible. In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a Lesser Festival. His most popular work has proven to be his "Preces Privatae" or "Private Prayers", which was published posthumously and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. His "Ninety-Six Sermons" have been occasionally reprinted and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes has been commemorated by literary greats such as T. S. Eliot.

"Parapinnixa affinis" was first described by Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1900, in his "Synopsis of California stalk-eyed Crustacea". The type specimen was a single female, collected in July 1895 from Dead Man's Island, San Pedro, California (now part of the Port of Los Angeles); it was donated to the University of California. "P. affinis" no longer lives at the type locality, which has been made unsuitable by the accumulation of "harbor refuse and oil". No further specimens were collected for over thirty years, until one was collected in 1930, and Steve Glassell collected specimens including an allotype in 1932.
