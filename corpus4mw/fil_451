The tribe lived in the part of southwestern Britain that today broadly coincides with the English counties of North Somerset, Bristol, and Gloucestershire; although at times their territory may have extended into parts of what are now Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire. Their capital acquired the Roman name of "Corinium Dobunnorum", which is today known as Cirencester.
UEC-SML is recognised as an entrance qualification in many tertiary educational institutions internationally, including those in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mainland China and some European countries, as well as most private colleges in Malaysia, but not by the government of Malaysia for entry into public universities. As the government of Malaysia does not recognise the UEC, some Chinese independent high schools provide instructions in the public secondary school syllabus in addition to the independent school syllabus, thus enabling the students to sit for PMR, SPM, or even STPM.

In the Dhammapada commentary of Buddhaghosa a "Bhikkhu" is defined as "the person who sees danger (in samsara or cycle of rebirth)" (Pāli: "ikkhatīti: bhikkhu"). He therefore seeks ordination to obtain release from it. The "Dhammapada" states: 
The dish was invented by Alfredo di Lelio I at his restaurant, Alfredo, in 1914 as a variation of "Fettuccine al burro". When butter was added both before and after fettuccine was put in the serving bowl, the dish was known as "doppio burro" (double butter). Di Lelio's "original contribution" was to double the amount of butter in the bowl before the fettuccine would be poured in, thus a "triplo burro" (or "triple butter") effect instead of double which he started doing for his pregnant wife who was having difficulty keeping food down. Alfredo added the new dish to his restaurant's menu when his wife began eating again.

Powers and abilities.
The prevention of oxygen toxicity depends entirely on the setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity must be carried out without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.
Many notable texts in Persian mystic literature are not poems, yet highly read and regarded. Among those are "Kimiya-yi sa'ādat" and "Asrar al-Tawhid".
Street-Porter became editor of the "Independent on Sunday" in 1999. Despite derision from her critics, she took the paper's circulation up to 270,460, an increase of 11.6 per cent. In 2002 she became editor-at-large, writing a regular column.

Steward's Mirror Laboratory (SOML), located under the east side of Arizona Stadium, has pioneered new techniques of large mirror production, including spin-casting lightweight honeycomb mirrors in a rotating furnace, and stressed-lap polishing. The Mirror Laboratory completed the second mirror for the Large Binocular Telescope in September, 2005. The Mirror Lab is currently working on the 8.4 meter diameter primary/tertiary mirror for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and has started work on 2 of the 7 off-axis primary mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope.

Lindsey German stood as the Left List candidate for London mayor. Some members of Respect Renewal supported Lindsey German, while others supported the incumbent, Labour Party candidate Ken Livingstone. The International Socialist Group, part of Respect Renewal, called for a first preference vote for the Green Party candidate, Siân Berry, rather than Lindsey German.

Due to the long run of the series, several generations of Canadian children, as well as Americans growing up in northern United States regions that received the CBC signal, grew up watching Mr. Dressup and his adventures. Ernie Coombs and the character of Mr. Dressup have become strong Canadian icons and a part of Canadian pop culture.
Henk B. Rogers was born in the Netherlands and is of Dutch-Indonesian (Indo) descent. He lived in New York City, United States, from the age of eleven. He attended Stuyvesant High School where he got his first taste of computer programming. He then studied Computer Science and Role Playing Games at the University of Hawaii.
The most prominent leader of the party was Doug Christie, a British Columbia lawyer best known for having represented neo-Nazis James Keegstra, Ernst Zündel and Wolfgang Droege. To distance itself from Christie, the national party expelled him from the leadership in 1981 and denied him a membership in the party's Alberta branch. He later became leader of British Columbia's provincial WCC and ran for the party at the national and provincial levels several times. In 2005, he announced the creation of the Western Block Party which would be a western version of the "Bloc Québécois".

The group was formed in 1997 when Jimmy Urine was joined by Steve, Righ? on guitar, Urine's brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist Lyn-Z), and Urine's cousin Kitty on drums. They have released five albums, two EPs, one live album, and one live DVD. Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.
Like all crabs, fiddler crabs shed their shells as they grow. If they have lost legs or claws during their present growth cycle, a new one will be present when they molt. If the large fiddle claw is lost, males will develop one on the opposite side after their next molt. Newly molted crabs are very vulnerable because of their soft shells. They are reclusive and hide until the new shell hardens.
Career.
The Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the Japanese Imperial Army made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

This is a list of frigates of the United States Navy, sorted by hull number. It includes all of the hull classification symbols FF and FFG. Prior to the 1975 ship reclassification, ships that are now classified as FF or FFG were classified as DE or DEG (destroyer escort). The FFG-7 class frigates are slowly being removed from active duty in the Navy, to be eventually replaced by the Littoral Combat Ship.

The American Volunteer Group was replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group with the 74th, 75th and 76th Fighter squadrons, its organization rounded by the transfer of men and P-40s from two squadrons of the 51st Fighter Group in India.
1946 saw the publication of "From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology", a translation of Weber's essays co-authored with Hans Gerth. In 1953, the two published a second work, "Character and Social Structure: The Psychology of Social Institutions".
On Chlothar's actual death in 561, the Frankish kingdom was divided between his sons in a new configuration. Each son ruled a distinct realm, which was not necessarily geographically coherent but could contain two unconnected regions, from a chief city after which his kingdom is called. Charibert received Neustria (the region between the Somme and the Loire), Aquitaine, and Novempopulana with Paris as his capital. His chief cities were Rouen, Tours, Poitiers, Limoges, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Cahors, and Albi. Guntram received Burgundy, then Sigebert received Austrasia (including Rheims) with his capital at Metz, and the youngest brother Chilperic received a compact kingdom with Soissons as its capital.

The name “Adirondack” is an Iroquois word which means tree-eater and referred to their neighbors (more commonly known as the Algonquians) who collected the inner bark of this tree, "Picea rubens", and others during times of winter starvation. The white soft inner bark (cambial layer) was carefully separated from the hard, dark brown bark and dried. When pounded this product can be used as flour or added to stretch other starchy products.
The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, was created by Parliament in 1995 as an aide to the AGC, and has offices within the precinct of the AGC. The Commissioner is empowered under the 1995 amendments to the Auditor-General Act to receive " petitions on environmental and sustainable development matters and require ministers to respond to them." The petition process requires the Ministry to respond in 120 days, although the process may be delayed by litigation.
USS "Suwannee" (CVE-27) (originally an oiler AO-33, converted to an escort carrier AVG/ACV/CVE-27) was laid down on 3 June 1938 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, under a Maritime Commission contract as Markay (MC hull 5); launched on 4 March 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Howard L. Vickery; delivered to the Keystone Tankship Corporation and operated by that company until acquired by the United States Navy on 26 June 1941; renamed Suwannee (AO-33); and commissioned on 16 July 1941, Commander Joseph R. Lannom in command.
The woolly-necked stork is a broad winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.
Their promise was not fulfilled by the Polish government. In the following years, the historical discourse between Polish and Ukrainian researchers has often been based on historical stereotypes stemming from ethnic conflicts during the First World War and the interwar period, making it difficult to draw an objective account of bilateral Polish-Ukrainian relations during World War II.
Characteristics.
However, in practice it is also common for code sections to represent dead or unreachable code only "under certain conditions", which may not be known at the time of compilation. Such conditions may be imposed by different runtime environments (for example different versions of an operating system, or different sets and combinations of drivers or services loaded in a particular target environment), which may require different sets of special cases in the code, but at the same time become conditionally dead code for the other cases. Also, the software (for example, a driver or resident service) may be configurable to include or exclude certain features depending on user preferences, rendering unused code portions useless in a particular scenario. While modular software may be developed to dynamically load libraries on demand only, in most cases, it is not possible to load only the relevant routines from a particular library, and even if this would be supported, a routine may still include code sections which can be considered dead code in a given scenario, but could not be ruled out at compile time, already.

Nanyang () -South, /-sun (the south side of a mountain, or the north side of a river, which in Chinese is called "Yang" meaning "sunny"). "Wan" (宛) is the abbreviation for Nanyang which in ancient times was known as "Wancheng" (), meaning "Wan City".
As illustrated in the entry on granophyre, crystals of quartz and feldspar can crystallize in intricate intergrowths with geometric forms, sufficiently coarse to be easily distinguishable by means of the microscope. Often the quartz or the feldspar of the intergrowth extinguishes simultaneously with a crystal of either of these minerals lying in the center of the aggregate. These intergrowths crystallize from a melt, not in the solid state.

Pathophysiology.
After refit alongside , "Atule" conducted extensive drills in multiple fire torpedo attacks, gunfire, sound training and evasion exercises. On 2 April, she departed Midway, bound for Guam. After one day alongside in Apra Harbor, the submarine departed on 12 April for her patrol area off Bungo Suido. covered the east entrance and "Atule" the west. The patrol consisted almost entirely of lifeguard duty and mine destruction. On 4 May, she sighted an enemy submarine but it escaped before "Atule" could close for attack. On 5 May, "Atule" and a B-29 Superfortress "Dumbo" plane—which carried an airborne lifeboat for air-sea rescue operations—conducted a coordinated attack on two Japanese planes. "Atule" acted as "fighter" director and vectored the Superfortress to the Japanese planes. She then submerged and watched as one plane fled and one was shot down in a very unusual dogfight. "Atule" rescued one badly burned Japanese flier from the wreckage. The war patrol ended on 30 May when "Atule" arrived at Pearl Harbor for a three-week refit by .
