Synopsis.
Deadalus requests Gabriam’s presence to display the nanobot’s immense potential, enhancing NEW-GEN’s landscape and revitalizing the world’s plant life. Gabriam expresses his gratitude and commends his apprentice’s vision, and Deadalus retorts that if he is truly appreciative, he will allow him to use their discoveries to heal his sick wife, Kallius. Gabriam refuses, claiming the nanobots aren’t stable enough for human trials, and past experimentation on Kallius have progressed her condition. As they quarrel, Deadalus is alerted that his wife has taken a turn for the worse. He rushes to Kallius’ side where she bids him farewell and asks him to look after their infant daughter, Carmen. Once again, Deadalus begs his mentor to intervene, but it’s too late. Mourning his loss, Deadalus becomes consumed with grief and resentment toward Gabriam.
