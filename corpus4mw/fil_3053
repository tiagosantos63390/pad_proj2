In 1925, E. H. C. Oliphant first linked the name of Thomas Middleton with the play; he argued that "The Bloody Banquet" was a Dekker/Middleton collaboration. Further research and the use of stylistic analysis has brought about a consensus that the authors were Dekker and Middleton. David Lake, in his 1975 analysis of attribution problems in the Middleton canon, suggested that "The play is a much-revised one, written originally by Middleton with some help from Dekker about 1600–02" — though he acknowledged this as only one possibility. Macdonald Jackson strengthened the case for Middleton two decades later. More recently, Gary Taylor has included it Middleton's "Collected Works" (2007), and has argued that the play was originally written by Middleton and Dekker in 1608–09, and then adapted in the 1620s. A 21st-century adaptation is available.
In 1914, some tribal-majority areas were separated from the erstwhile Darrang and Lakhimpur districts of Assam Province of British India to form the North-East Frontier Tracts (NEFT). The NEFT was initially divided into two sections: the Central & Eastern Section (comprising the erstwhile Dibrugarh Frontier Tract, created in 1882, and some more areas in south) and the Western Section. Each section was placed under a political officer. In 1919, the Central and Eastern Section was renamed as Sadiya Frontier Tract, while the Western Section was renamed as Balipara Frontier Tract. In 1937, Sadiya and Balipara Frontier Tracts along with Lakhimpur Frontier Tract (also created in 1919) of Assam Province came to be collectively known as the "Excluded Areas of province of Assam" under the provisions of Government of India Act, 1935. By Regulation 1 of 1943 ("The North Eastern Frontier Tracts (Internal Administration) Regulation 1943") Tirap Frontier Tract was created by amalgamating certain areas of Sadiya and Lakhimpur Frontier Tracts. In 1946, Balipara Frontier Tract was divided into two administrative units: Sela Sub-Agency and Subansiri Area. 
Overview.
These myths have been called incomplete story fragments on the creation of the world. They share some elements with the neighboring people in Central and Northern California, such as Miwok mythology. The Bay Miwok people also believed that the world started with water surrounding the tallest mountain in the region Mount Diablo. The Ohlone myths contain numerous similarities to Yokuts mythology and cosmogony.

"One of the finest lessons I ever learned was from the great German actor Albert Basserman. I worked with him as Hilde in "The Master Builder" by Ibsen. He was already past eighty but was as 'modern' in his conception of the role of Solness and in his techniques as anyone I've ever seen or played with. In rehearsals he felt his way with the new cast. (The role had been in his repertoire for almost forty years.) He watched us, listened to us, adjusted to us, meanwhile executing his actions with only a small part of his playing energy. At the first dress rehearsal, he started to play fully. There was such a vibrant reality to the rhythm of his speech and behavior that I was swept away by it. I kept waiting for him to come to an end with his intentions so that I could take my 'turn.' As a result, I either made a big hole in the dialogue or desperately cut in on him in order to avoid another hole. I was expecting the usual 'It's your turn; then it's my turn.' At the end of the first act I went to his dressing room and said, 'Mr. Basserman, I can't apologize enough, but I never know when you're through!' He looked at me in amazement and said, 'I'm never through! And neither should you be.'"
In the following year, 1957, the Fair was moved to Belgrade, where the construction of a modern fair ground was completed. The books were displayed by about 60 local and 36 international publishers, from 16 countries in Europe, America and Asia. It was agreed that the International Book Fair should include the catalog and last for six days. The Fair was held at the end of October, in Belgrade Fair Hall 3 and on the occasion of the Fair festivity, the Book and the World magazine was initiated, as well. The first Belgrade Book Fair was opened by Mr. Rodoljub Colakovic, the Vice President of the Federal Executive Council at that time.
In a usage referring to singular network services, a web operating system is another name for a Webtop. These services turn the desktop into a service that runs on the Internet rather than on the local computer. As these services include a file system and application management system, they increasingly overlap with the functionality of a traditional desktop computer operating system.

FreeBSD has several unique features related to storage. Soft updates can protect the consistency of the UFS filesystem (widely used on the BSDs) in the event of a system crash. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.
Track listing.
In 1903, Peder Bogen of Sandefjord and Christian Nielsen of Larvik, brought their whaling companies to the Shetland Islands. At first, the whalers were welcomed by local herring fishermen whose nets were often damaged by whales. After the first season of whaling, and poor herring catches, the fishermen turned against the whalers. The fishermen believed the offal and blood from whale carcasses attracted sharks and frightened the herring. In 1904, an official committee was unable to determine any link between whaling and herring stocks. Although catches had suffered for years, fishermen insisted on blaming the whalers and protests led to many new restrictions. After the WWI stoppage, in 1920, renewed objections to whaling persuaded the Norwegian companies to leave.
In October 2007, CASMII together with the National Iranian American Council and some other organisations sent a letter to the political leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom and Iran opposing military actions and appealing to the governments "to set aside all pre-conditions and resume direct and open negotiations on all issues of dispute, ..."

He died at Alessandria in 1785. The citizens of his native town erected a marble statue to his memory, in the church of the Barnabites where he was interred.

In the early 1960s, back in Dublin, Fennell wrote art criticism for several Dublin publications and was briefly exhibitions officer of the new Irish Arts Council. Influenced by the approaching fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Rising, he read the writings of the leaders of the Irish Revolution, identifying their project as a restorative humanism: a movement aiming to restore the broken humanity of Ireland as a democratically self-governing nation, economically self-sustaining, intellectually self-determining and culturally self-shaping. Significant Fennell essays of this time were "Will the Irish Stay Christian?", "The Failure of the Irish Revolution – and Its Success", "Cuireadh chun na Tríú Réabhlóide" and "Irish Catholics and Freedom since 1916". He enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Fr. Austin Flannery OP, editor of the monthly journal "Doctrine and Life" which published a succession of his writings.

Ab (أَب), from a theoretical, abstract form "ʼabawun" (triliteral ʼ-b-w) is Arabic for "father". The dual is "ʼabawāni" or "ʼabāni" "two fathers" or "mother and father" ("ʼābāʼi-ka" meaning "thy parents").
However the truce was broken in January 1969 when People's Democracy, a radical left-wing group, staged an anti-government march from Belfast to Derry. Loyalists attacked the marchers a number of times, most determinedly at Burntollet bridge (about five miles (8 km) outside Derry), and the RUC were accused of not protecting the marchers. This action, and the RUC's subsequent entry into the Bogside, led to serious rioting in Derry. .
