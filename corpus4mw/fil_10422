Now, however, having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul was left with no option other than to return to Constantinople, perhaps motivated, in view of his advancing old age, by confessing his sins and receiving absolution. In 1394, he was back in the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch Antony IV, to whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, "Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic". The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing the final verdict, is missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so that it is likely that he was forgiven. Nothing further is known of him after that.
