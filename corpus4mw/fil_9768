Each episode in the series introduces new groups of strangers who are dropped off in a remote location. Each episode has a different location. For example, one episode takes place in the American Southwest and another episode takes place in the island of Hawaii. Once the teams are dropped at a location, they are supplied with only a single bottle of water and a GPS tracking device. The goal of the competition is to survive and travel through harsh and dangerous environments, such as dangerous wildlife or insect infestations to find a hidden briefcase containing $100,000. The team that finds the briefcase are the winners of the competition and they receive the $100,000 cash prize.
