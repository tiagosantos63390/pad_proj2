Because archive material of the hundreds of local Belgian refugee committees is scant and incomplete and because systems of registration were not waterproof (nor did they run from the very start of the conflict), it is very difficult to estimate the number of Belgians that have sought refuge in Britain during World War 1. Estimations vary between 225,000 and 265,000. The estimation does not include the roughly 150,000 Belgian soldiers that have taken leave in Britain at one point in the war and an additional 25,000 wounded Belgian soldiers convalescing in Britain.

Young Bowers attended the Ouachita-Maynard Academy in Maynard in Randolph County. This institution was one of the forerunners of Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia in Clark County. Bowers then enrolled at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, from which he procured a teacher’s certificate in 1906. He then taught school at rural Clearview in Randolph County. Meanwhile, he studied law in the offices of lawyer friends in Pocahontas and in 1913 was admitted to the state bar. He ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Arkansas House in both 1908 and 1916 and for the United States House of Representatives in 1924. In his two consecutive bids for governor, he was defeated by the Democrats John Ellis Martineau and Harvey Parnell. He polled 23.6 percent of the general election vote in 1926; 22.7 percent in 1928. In the latter election year, U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson was the vice presidential nominee on the Al Smith Democratic ticket, which won the electoral votes of Arkansas.
