He is the author of "The End of Gay (and the death of heterosexuality)", published in Canada in 1999, in the US in 2002 and the UK in 2004. The book argues that there is no such thing as inherent sexual identity, and that sexual behaviour is a product of many factors, personal will not least among them.
The Dragon Lady first appeared in 1934 in the first Sunday strip story. She began as a stereotypically beautiful, seductive and evil Asian, but as the comic strip became more realistic, the character grew more complex. Fans of the strip recall her passionate love for Pat Ryan, and the time she taught Terry how to dance. In the years leading up to World War II, she became a heroic though Machiavellian figure leading the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China.

Warner, who is gay, is highly influential in the fields of Early American literature, social theory, and queer theory. His first book, "The Letters of the Republic: Publication and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century America", established him as a leading scholar in Early American literature, print culture, and public sphere theory. He later became a public figure in the gay community for his book "The Trouble with Normal", in which Warner contended that queer theory and the ethics of a queer life serve as critiques of existing social and economic structures, not just as critique of heterosexuality and heterosexual society. His most recent work, "Publics and Counterpublics" is a collection of essays on the politics of communication in advanced capitalistic societies, or Habermasian public sphere theory.

Chicago Vocational Career Academy (commonly known as CVCA, Chicago Vocational High School or CVS) is a public 4-year vocational high school located in the Avalon Park neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It opened in 1940. The school was barely opened when the outbreak of World War II caused a change in plan. The school would be a vocational school, but one under the control of the United States Navy, where many mechanics who would build and repair aircraft, among others, were trained. After the war, the school was instrumental in helping returning veterans who went off to war prior to graduation to earn their diploma. The school is also closely associated with a few of its notable alumni, none more so than Dick Butkus, who played football at CVS and at the University of Illinois before his Hall of Fame career for the Chicago Bears.
Infection of various plants by "A. ritzemabosi" is likely to cause some degree of yield loss to growers where the nematode is present since photosynthetic area of the leaves is damaged or destroyed as the nematodes feed and reproduce. However, this nematode is not considered to cause economic loss unless environmental conditions are very suitable.
Five years after the end of the resistance movement and the peace proclamation of 1902 the first bicameral legislative body was elected in 1907. Coinciding with the establishment of the legislature, a civil service was formed under the guidance of the U.S. and was gradually taken over by the Filipinos. By the end of the first world war the Filipinos had established control over their own civil services. Shortly thereafter the Catholic Church was largely disestablished and a considerable amount of church land was purchased and redistributed.
Putting this behind him, he tried to reunite with Reva only to be confronted with a series of family problems; nephew Bill's drinking and the appearance of Jonathan Randall. While he tried to protect Reva from her newfound son, he continued to alienate her and move closer to Cassie. Her health began deteriorating and she grew distant. After they split, he became the confidante of both Cassie and Olivia, the latter even trying to resume their broken relationship. He rejected her, divorced Reva again, then remarried her. After finding his father's blueprints for a veteran's hospital, he decided to make his dreams come true and build it. Reva became distant and deceptive again when she became ill and he found himself spending most of his time with Cassie. They slowly developed a relationship and he divorced Reva. When it came out that she was on her deathbed, he rushed to her side to offer his support, but insisted on remaining with Cassie.
The light was recently painted, circa 2007.
