In November 1653 Gerard appeared as a witness at the trial of Don Pantaleone Sá, a brother of the Portuguese ambassador, for the murder of an Englishman. The night before the murder Gerard had overheard Pantaleone Sá and his friends talking of English affairs in the street and had given them the lie, whereupon they had attacked him, and, though a little man, yet "he threw him off that was upon him, and so was hustling with him a good while", but was rescued by a passer-by, after he had received a stab in the shoulder. Don Pantaleon Sá was affronted by what he perceived to be a slight on his honour and he returned to the location the next day with an armed retinue to seek revenge. He mistook another man for Gerard and killed him. Pantaleone Sá sought sanctuary in the ambassador's residence, but the Lord Chief Justice, Henry Rolle,supported by other expert opinions, decided that exterritoriality coved the ambassador and not members of his household in cases of murder, so Pantaleone Sá was arrested tried and found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged.
