Back in Kure on 25 June 1944, "Suzuya" was refit once again.

Spiro (2009) explains the modest sales by five factors: 1) The book appeared when the anti-German propaganda machine was shifting into high gear, with images of raping nuns and bombing cathedrals; 2) The message was anti-democratic and anti-Christian, which did not sit well with the patriotic public; 3) Hereditarianism ran counter to the belief in education, hard work, and "pulling yourself by the bootstraps"; 4) Immigration during the First World War declined because ships were allocated to the war effort; 5) The work was categorised by the publisher as "science", and so never had a chance at mass popularity.
