In the context of the sciences, the term "anthropomorphism" has been deprecated to the point that, when applied to a scientist, the term functions as a pejorative (see above). There is also a risk of straying off the path of objectivity, however, when scientists choose to assume that only humans possess any degree of certain traits. This assumption is called anthropocentrism, practitioners of which either believe in or unintentionally form an outlook of human exceptionalism. Darwin — to the chagrin of many religious philosophers — dismissed these ideas of human exceptionalism in his book "The Descent of Man" by saying that our differences are "only in degree and not in kind".
