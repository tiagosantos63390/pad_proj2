History.
Hirschberg (Bavaria)
Club Sport José Pardo is a Peruvian football club, playing in the city of Tumán, Lambayeque, Peru.

"Scyllarides latus" was originally classified in the genus "Scyllarus", along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time ("Scyllarus arctus", "Scyllarides aequinoctialis", "Thenus orientalis" and "Arctides guineensis"). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely "Thenus" and "Ibacus". In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus "Scyllarus" into two genera, "Scyllarus" and "Arctus", but made the error of including the type species of "Scyllarus" in the genus "Arctus". This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised "Arctus" with "Scyllarus", and erected a new genus "Scyllarides" to hold the species that De Haan had placed in "Scyllarus". "Scyllarides" is placed in the subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, "Arctides", is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.
