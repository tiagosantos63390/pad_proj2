The separation and run time also depends on the film thickness (of the stationary phase), the column diameter and the column length.
Born in San Francisco, California, Carroll is the son of Rita C. (née Bann) and James Edward "Jim" Carroll. Two of his paternal great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his maternal grandparents were Croatians emigrated from Austria.(Today's Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). Carroll attended Redwood High School in Larkspur. After being an athlete in childhood, his lack of physical growth as a teenager caused him frustration in high school sports; weighing as an incoming freshman, he was required to bring a special doctor's clearance in order to try out for football. He was a multi-sport star in football (playing quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back), basketball, and baseball, earning the school's Athlete of the Year award as a senior in 1969; forty years later he was inducted into the charter class of the Redwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame in April 2009.
