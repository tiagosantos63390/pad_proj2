Star Trek D·A·C (Deathmatch. Assault. Conquest) is a video game inspired by the 2009 "Star Trek" movie. The developer is Naked Sky Entertainment (makers of RoboBlitz) in collaboration with Bad Robot Productions, the production company responsible for the movie. The title is derived from the game's three modes of play: Deathmatch, Assault, and Conquest. The game was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade on May 13, 2009, for the PlayStation 3 (via the PlayStation Network) and Microsoft Windows on November 12, 2009, and for Mac OS X (Intel only) on December 23, 2009. As of July 2013, the Steam version of the game was no longer accessible for download, thus rendering the PC version of the game unplayable.
Co-Op was a weekly video podcast produced, written and directed by Area 5 Media LLC and distributed by Revision3. The format of the show usually discusses two or three upcoming or recent videogame releases in detail. Instead of using review scores, "Co-Op" uses a conversation style with industry representatives and video gaming journalists in order to "share in the critique, love and bashing".
