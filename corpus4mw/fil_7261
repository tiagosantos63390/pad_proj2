1. Rangbhoomi (2013) [http://moifightclub.wordpress.com/2013/10/23/first-look-kamal-swaroops-rangbhoomi-trailer-synopsis/]

Description
"Truly Blessed" peaked at #49 on the "Billboard" 200 and #4 on the R&B chart. It spawned Pendergrass' third and last R&B chart-topping single in "It Should've Been You", and also contained two further top 40 R&B singles.
The gameplay is similar to the game Gauntlet. Gameplay is depicted from a top-down perspective and players fire projectiles at enemies. Players can collect atoms to purchase power-ups and healing items between levels. Every level consists of two levels set in a specific setting usually appropriate with horror films (e.g., a cemetery, a laboratory). After completing those levels, the player must complete a trial level, where they must achieve a certaint objective. Failure to complete the trial levels results in having to fight a boss.
