Examples are: "Toiletten-Tief-Taucher" ("toilet deep diver", which is an alliteration in German), or "Mutterficker" ("motherfucker"). A whole range of these expressions aim at supposedly weak or conformist behaviour, such as "Ampel-bei-Rot-Stehenbleiber" ("traffic-lights-on-red-stopper"), "Warmduscher" ("warm-showerer"), "Unterhosen-Wechsler" ("underpants changer"), or "Schattenparker" ("in the shadow parker").

“Young women, of all colors, are sexual pawns or playthings,” writes Nelson George in speaking about blaxploitation film (George 53). There are several instances in the film where this can be seen. When Diablo and his crew of men raid a house of a drug dealer, a young white woman who is unable to take her heroine begs Diablo for the drugs back. She offers money, drugs and finally sex in return for the drugs. They gangsters end up leaving her to her own broken state by refusing her advances. Clearly she is portrayed as a bad girl in the film, being mixed with social taboos that may not be seen as respectable in society. Norma Manatu writes in "African American Women and Sexuality in the Cinema", “social rewards await those who remain within the borders of ‘appropriate’ sexual behaviors” (Manatu 56). Usually black women are portrayed as ones who seem to only “require…raw sexual pleasure” (Manatu 58). But in this film, the strong female role in Yvonne covers an unusual basis for black women in film. Her scene when talking in the morning with J.J. depicts a tender and sweet emotional side of her. It also shows that J.J. cherishes her as his love interest. According to Manatu’s research, she finds that researchers implicitly find in their work that “romantic love primarily accentuates sentiment and emotion, attributes clearly not associated with, nor expected of, black women” (Manatu 58). With Yvonne, Evans as a filmmaker portrays her as an emotionally sensitive and smart woman and plays with notions of power being that Yvonne ends up killing the main antagonist (Tony) stopping the potential deaths of J.J., Diablo, and herself. There is a problem when film portrays negative images and assigns specific roles constantly to one group. “The dominant defining characteristic of black women as ‘sexual other’ may, in fact become seared in viewers’ minds…perpetuation of the negative imagery of black female sexuality involves a complex set of social systems and beliefs that works together to preserve the image” (Manatu 50). Different constructions of the black female can be found in many blaxploitation films.
