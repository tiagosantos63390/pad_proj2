The following is a list of episodes of the television series "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" which aired in 1976:

Mark Lemon, the first editor of the satirical magazine "Punch", lived on the High Street in Crawley from 1858 until his death in 1870. He became an important figure in Crawley society, and was generous with his time and money: for example, in 1863, he organised and paid for festivities at the George Hotel and the nearby White Hart Inn to celebrate the wedding of Edward, Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra of Denmark. A blue plaque outside the George commemorates his time in the town.

In 1888, the 20 year old Rygg immigrated to the United States and located in Chicago. He first worked at a nickel plant and entered simultaneously in a trade school, then he studied law for a time at the Chicago College of Law. After three years he was employed as a cashier in the "Skandinaven" business department and stayed there for 12 years.
The Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 (41 & 42 Vict. c.73) is an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. The long title of the Act is "An Act to regulate the law relating to the Trial of Offences committed on the Sea within a certain distance of the Coasts of Her Majesty’s Dominions." It is still in force. It codifies the law relating to offences committed in the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, including crimes committed on foreign ships. Under section 7 of the Act, the applicable law is the law of England and Wales, even if the offence is committed off the coast of Scotland or Northern Ireland.
