Incident.
In 2006 Lynch's team reached the Munster final with Kerry lining out against them. That game ended in a 0–10 points apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team surprisingly defeat Kerry by 1–12 to 0–9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1–7 of Cork's total. Lynch had secured a third Munster winners' medal. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final for the third time in five seasons. In a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0–16 to 0–10 resulted in Cork being knocked out of the championship.
