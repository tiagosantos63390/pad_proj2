Shop assistants, so far as they are engaged in manual, not merely clerical labour, come under the provisions of the Truck Acts 1831 to 1887, and in all circumstances they fall within the sections directed against unfair and unreasonable fines in the Truck Act 1896; but, unlike employees in factories, workshops, laundries and mines, they are left to apply these provisions so far as they can themselves, since neither Home Office inspectors nor officers of the local authority have any specially assigned powers to administer the Truck Acts in shops.
The runic text indicates that the stone was raised as a memorial by four men in memory of a man named Fúl. The relationship between the men is described as a being a "félag", which was a joint financial venture between partners during the Viking Age. Other runestones that use a form of the term "félag" include Sö 292 in Bröta, Vg 112 in Ås, Vg 122 in Abrahamstorp, the now-lost Vg 146 in Slöta, Vg 182 in Skattegården, U 391 in Villa Karlsro, the now-lost U 954 in Söderby, DR 1 in Haddeby, DR 68 in Århus, DR 125 in Dalbyover, DR 127 in Hobro, DR 262 in Fosie, DR 270 in Skivarp, DR 279 in Sjörup, DR 316 in Norra Nöbbelöv, DR 318 in Håstad, DR 321 in Västra Karaby, DR 329 and DR 330 in Gårdstånga, DR 339 in Stora Köpinge, and X UaFv1914;47 in Berezanj, Ukraina.
Financial aid.
Early 1939 it was still considered to order about 250 vehicles. During this time SEAM experienced severe financial difficulties, however. When in July 1938 new specifications called for a main 75 mm armament in the turret, the company was unable to finance a completely redesigned vehicle; the existing prototype could not easily be adapted and its transmission had already shown to be overloaded by earlier weight increases. The company appealed to the ARL workshop to assist; the "Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement" ordered on 19 January that ARL should comply; it received the prototype to install an ARL 3 turret on a widened superstructure. When war broke out, on 10 September 1939 this development was suspended. On 22 December 1939 it was restarted but merely as a technology demonstrator; at the time of the Fall of France the vehicle was still unfinished and without turret, though it was the only offshoot of the Char G1 project to near completion or even to be in a running condition.

The film is punctuated with Billy's fantasy sequences of himself and Gabriel in pastiches of romantic film scenes, including the aforementioned "From Here to Eternity" and the films of Fred Astaire. Billy carries a Polaroid camera with him everywhere, and his reminiscences are illustrated with Polaroid photographs. The film in fact opens with such a monologue, with Billy relying on a series of Polaroids while relating how he grew up gay "in a small town in Indiana, where there's plenty of corn, fast cars, and straights. Lots and lots of straights. I mean, "a lot."" Billy's opening narrative demonstrates his awareness that he is in a film and breaking the fourth wall.

Collection d'Arnell~Andréa is a French neoclassical darkwave band founded by Jean-Christophe d'Arnell (main composer, writer, piano/keyboards), Pascal Andréa, and Chloé St Liphard in 1986. Andréa left the band shortly after its founding, before its first performance. However, d'Arnell left Andréa's name in the band name. Their music features prominently keyboards, cello, and Chloé's vocals. The band is known for including a large collection or ensemble of musicians in its live performances and has performed at numerous international music festivals including Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen. Many of their albums have focused on late 19th and early 20th century themes.
