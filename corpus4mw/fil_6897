Like the NUWSS, the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, Sylvia Pankhurst travelled to Glasgow and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that "peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats." Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker’s Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.
This jail, located in Claude, Texas was erected in 1953 with the designs of Lawrence A. Kerr and Clayton B. Shiver. It was built with stone quarried 14 miles to the south of Claude in Palo Duro Canyon that was recycled from the demolition of the former jail built in 1893. The jail houses inmates on the second floor and the first floor formerly served as the home of the Sheriff, though it has been converted to office space. The jail is also the location of the county's public safety answering point (PSAP) and dispatch center.
