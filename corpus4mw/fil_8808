Japanese pirates (or Wokou) were a constant problem, not only for China and Korea, but also for Japanese society, from the thirteenth century until Hideyoshi's failed invasions of Korea at the end of the sixteenth century. Japanese pirates were often from the undesirable parts of Japanese society, and the Japanese were just as happy to be (for the most part) rid of them as they were raiding more prosperous shores (at the time, Japan was ravaged by civil wars, and so while Korea, China, and the Mongol Empire were enjoying relative peace, prosperity, and wealth, the Japanese were upon hard times).

She meets Stepan, a good-looking peasant man, equally unhappy in his family life, who falls in love with her. She reciprocates. The two decide to run away, obtain false documents and head for the South aiming at Nikolayev, but get caught in Nezhin, a provincial Oryol Governorate town, and find themselves jailed. Nastya gives birth to a boy, who soon dies. As the pair is being transported back home, Stepan falls ill and lags behind, later to die of typhoid. Now stark raving mad, Nastya arrives back to the Prokudin house. Again Sila Krylushkin comes to help, giving the woman safe haven in his home where some of his patients are being kept. The house is raided by the police, though, now its owner “illegal” healing practice being the matter of investigation. The violent ‘medical inspection’ which follows sends Nastya into a state of frenzy.

The majority of Dr. Bolitho's academic research has been on nerve injuries to the upper extremity. Much of his early research targeted early childhood injuries. For example, in 1994 Bolitho presented his research before the South African Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons Annual Congress on the subject of ulnar nerve injuries in childhood, and in 1995 he presented his research to the British Association of Hand Sugeons on the subject of Primary epineurial repair of the median nerve in childhood. His research has also included reconstruction of the breast after mastectomy for breast cancer. For instance, in 2000 Bolitho presented research to the Southeastern Society of Plastic Surgeons on the subject of the results of immediate breast reconstruction after skin-sparing mastectomy—a presentation that was the recipient of the Best Paper award at the conference. That same year, Bolitho was a part of a large contingent of medical doctors that presented a 25 year study of the utility of the omentum in the reconstruction of complex wounds and defects to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Over his career Dr. Bolitho has published research papers in academic journals including "Hepatology", the "South African Journal of Surgery", the "European Journal of Plastic Surgery", the "Journal of Hand Surgery", the "Annals of Plastic Surgery", and "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery". He is also the author of the book "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery", a two volume textbook for those pursuing a fellowship in plastic surgery. Since 2003 Bolitho has also maintained a private surgical practice called the Scripps Plastic Surgery Medical Group.
The monument was paid for by public subscription; the chairman of the appeal committee was Rev. William Jay Bolton, the Vicar of Stratford. It was inaugurated in a ceremony on 2 August 1879, presided over by the Earl of Shaftesbury, who made a strongly anti-Catholic speech. The opinion of the local newspaper was that ""Language of this sort is better calculated to wound the feelings of many good people than to break down barriers that already too effectually divide the different denominations.""
