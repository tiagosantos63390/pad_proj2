According to the research of Dr. Fabian Hass, an entomologist who specializes in earwig biology, the relative age of this species compared to other genera in the suborder Archidermaptera can be approximated based upon the research of Dr. R. Willmann. According to Willmann, the genus "Archidermapteron," and therefore also the species "Archidermapteron martynovi," existed longer ago than the genera Dermapteron and Turanovia, but around the same time period as Asiodiplatys, Microdiplatys, and Protodiplatys. He bases this assumption on the shape of the fossils' cerci: Archidermateron, Asiodiplatys, Microdiplatys, and Protodiplatys all had cerci that were long and filiform, while Dermapteron had cerci that were short and more forcep-like. Therefore, Turanovia would have been in between both groups.
