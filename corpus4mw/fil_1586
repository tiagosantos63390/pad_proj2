Chavez never officially broke up, but they released no new material and played few shows between 1999 and 2006. In 2006, Matador Records released "Better Days Will Haunt You", a compilation of virtually all of Chavez's studio material up to that point, with the addition of new vocals for the song "White Jeans". The band played a few shows in support of the compilation, and later played with other bands such as Pavement and Sonic Youth.

It was a 16-bit system, developed in 1967 from the Simulation for Automatic Machinery. The first Nord-1 (serial number 2) installed was at the heart of a complete ship system aboard the MS "Taimyr", a Japanese-built cargo liner. The system included bridge control, power management, load condition monitoring and the first ever computer-controlled, radar-sensed anti-collision system (Automatic Radar Plotting Aid). "Taimyr"'s Nord-1 turned out reliable for the time, with more than a year between failures.
A film version has been in development, due to the success of the first book and film, but was delayed after the September 11 attacks.
