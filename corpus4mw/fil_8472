The Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway project was funded by "New Deal" programs established by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. In 1937, the city of Chicago successfully applied for a federal grant and loan from the Works Progress Administration for a grant and a loan to fund the construction of two subway tunnels, the first of which would be built beneath State Street and the second beneath Milwaukee Avenue and Dearborn Street. In March 1939, construction began on the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. The tunnel was buried deep to enable the use of a tunnel boring machine throughout the construction of the subway. Only brief sections were built using the "cut-and-cover' method. Rationing imposed by World War II delayed completion of the line due to a shortage of materials. Construction on the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, which was 80% completed in 1942, was temporarily halted to allow for the scarce supply of labor and materials to be used to continue construction of the State Street Subway, which was considered a priority. In December 1945, the city of Chicago resumed work on the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway.
