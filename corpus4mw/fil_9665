Chitinase domain-containing protein 1 (CHID1) is a highly conserved protein of unknown function located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 near the telomere. The protein has 27 introns, which allows for many isoforms of this gene. It has several aliases, the most common of which is Stabilin-1 interacting chitinase-like protein (SI-CLP). As indicated by the alias, CHID1 is known to interact with the protein STAB1. CHID1 is expressed ubiquitously at levels nearly 6 times the average gene, and is conserved very far back to organisms such as "Caenorhabditis elegans" and possibly some prokaryotes. This protein is known to have carbohydrate binding sites, which could be involved in carbohydrate catabolysis.
