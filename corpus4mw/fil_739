The book was generally well-reviewed. In a "New York Times" review, space writer Henry S.F. Cooper, Jr. called it a "highly readable memoir," while the "Kirkus Review" summed it up as a "highly detailed account ofÂ ... 20th century America's most dramatic technological achievement." Reviewers almost unanimously commented on the outspokenness of Kraft's storytelling, and his readiness to personally criticize those with whom he had disagreed. Cooper noted that Kraft "pull[s no punches about some of colleagues' shortcomings," and "Kliatt" magazine said that he "isn't afraid to name names."
