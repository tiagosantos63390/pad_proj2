Intervention effectiveness is evaluated continuously from multiple perspectives with MST team members held accountable for achieving successful outcomes. MST does not label families as “resistant, not ready for change or unmotivated.” This approach avoids blaming the family and places the responsibility for positive treatment outcomes on the MST team.

Lancaut, together with the adjacent woodland at Ban-y-Gor immediately to the north, was established in 1971 as a nature reserve, now managed by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Both reserves are part of the nationally important Lower Wye Gorge SSSI.

Friedrich Brentel, a German printmaker in engraving and etching, and miniature painter, was born at Lauingen in 1580, and became a citizen of Strasbourg in 1601. His principal work is a set of plates for 'The Funeral of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine,' and the Royal entry of his son as the new duke, published at Nancy in 1611. They are from the designs of Claude de La Ruelle and Jean La Hire, and are etched in a slight, spirited manner. One plate has a single horse and rider, out of a large group in a procession, done in a very different style, which is thought to be the first venture into etching of the Nancy court painter Jacques Bellange, now known mainly for his prints. Other noticeable plates of his are a 'View of the large Hall at Stuttgart' (1619), and 'John Frederick I., Elector of Saxony ' (1609). He died in Strasbourg in 1651. 
In a June 2011 interview by Mark Taylor for the Get Ready to Rock! website, Parr was asked why there was no further releases after Parr's following 1996 album "Under Parr" for over a decade. Parr responded ""I was dead in the water long before "Under Parr". From the nineties onwards I was locked in the litigation. I was ducking and diving doing little deals here and there to try and stay afloat. All my income was frozen for almost twenty years so I had to really bob and weave. "Man with a Vision" was really a bunch of demos but as there were no deals on the table I was forced to release it through Blue Martin a small label in Switzerland - it was the only game in town - on the up side the owner of that company Martin Scheiss and AR Sue Beherendt became lifelong friends. Even though we had very little exposure due to the court case - they invested in "Under Parr". I told them not to unless they could afford to promote it properly. In the end they spent a ton of money making the record and had little left to promote it. I walked away from music for the next ten years. It broke my heart. I was making records that only my family and friends heard - some of my best work I think, that no body was going to hear. The guitar stayed untouched in the box for ten years and I never sang a note.""
