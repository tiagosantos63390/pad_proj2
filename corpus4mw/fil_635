Teenage Connor is an angry, brooding, intense, and volatile teenager who is vindictive towards Angel. Vincent Kartheiser described him as withdrawn and "not willing to open up to the group happiness everyone is so inclined to be part of". He also highlighted his 'alienation' of this world and resulting caution and unwillingness to trust others. Tim Minear further characterizes Connor by his strong need for family which "means everything to this kid because he's never had one" and put emphasis on his "conflicted" personality triggered by his upbringing. David Fury and Minear also highlight Connor's similarity to Angel. Fury worked on the resemblance of strength, fighting style, and personality. Minear compared their trait of accepting responsibility even in the worst times. Intending to show Connor as a formidable fighter, Kelly A. Manners described him as "quite the hunter, quite the killer." Kartheiser notes him as "truly badass", and jokingly compares his fighting style to that of 'Jackie Chan', He is attracted to women older than him, which becomes a running gag in the series.
