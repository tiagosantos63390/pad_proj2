Document review is an important business process, requiring considerable resources. It is often a bottleneck in the overall document production lifecycle. Some reviews are simply achieved- for example, if the content is simple and short and also if only a couple of reviewers are involved. However, in many cases, the review requires the input of several others who provide specialist knowledge and other important input. This is often referred to as peer review whereby the content is evaluated by those of similar competence to enhance the document’s quality, check for accuracy, grammar and so forth.

In 1905, tracks were laid on the bridge to accommodate the "tranvias", a streetcar system that ran throughout Manila.
