About 1943, the P&F was cut back to 0.5 miles of track at Franklin Junction and freight was trans-loaded onto P&F trucks for final delivery.

In 1942, the various Belgian ground forces units in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, more often known as the "Brigade Piron" after its commanding officer, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Piron. The unit not only included motorized infantry, armoured cars and artillery but also various logistics and medical support units. In March 1944, an artillery battery of four 25 pounder guns operated by troops from Luxembourg was added to the brigade's artillery unit. 80 Luxembourgers were serving with the "Brigade Piron" by August 1944 when the Brigade landed in Normandy.
