The SCR (skin conductance response) is highly sensitive to emotions in some people. Fear, anger, startled response, orienting response and sexual feelings are among the reactions which may produce similar skin conductance responses. These responses are utilized as part of the polygraph or lie detector.
In April 2008, Health Canada concluded that, while adverse health effects were not expected, the margin of safety was too small for formula-fed infants and proposed classifying the chemical as "'toxic' to human health and the environment." Health Canadian Minister announced Canada's intent to ban the import, sale, and advertisement of polycarbonate baby bottles containing bisphenol A due to safety concerns, and investigate ways to reduce BPA contamination of baby formula packaged in metal cans. Subsequent news reports from April 2008 showed many retailers removing polycarbonate drinking products from their shelves.

Enright realized that a surface attack would be suicidal; the destroyers would blow "Archerfish" out of the water before he could get the sub into position. Even without the destroyers, Enright also knew the carrier was too massive for the sub's four-inch gun to have any effect. He ordered the carrier tracked from ahead in preparation for an attack from below. After six hours, the enemy carrier turned right back into "Archerfish"s path, and "Archerfish" got into an attack position. "Archerfish" fired six torpedoes. Enright deliberately set the torpedoes to run shallow () in hopes of capsizing the target by holing it higher up on its hull. He also wanted to increase the chances of a hit in case his torpedoes ran deeper than set. Even as "Archerfish" began to descend to avoid a depth charge attack, Enright and the crew saw the carrier was already listing to starboard. The crew also began picking up loud breaking-up noises from the target shortly after firing the last torpedo. The noises continued for 47 minutes.
