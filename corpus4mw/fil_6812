For the 1954 Universal International Pictures film "The Glenn Miller Story", directed by Anthony Mann, a wartime performance set in a U.K. air base hangar was shot in Hangar No. 1 at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 10 July 1953, with the late-production B-17G command plane of Gen. John G. Sprague, commanding officer of Lowry, as a backdrop. It received a wartime coat of olive drab paint for the appearance, but the chin turret has been removed. Anachronistic B-29 engine cowlings line the back wall of the hangar, none of which operated in the ETO.
