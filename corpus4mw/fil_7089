Walsh began picking up the emotional roles that Fanny Davenport had been playing, as Davenport was ill for a time prior to her 1898 death. Walsh was much younger than Davenport but bore a strong resemblance to her. After several years apprenticing in the emotional roles, Walsh moved up to more challenging parts such as Maslova the prostitute in Tolstoy's "Resurrection" and Margaret Rolfe in "The Woman in the Case". She also starred in a production of Tolstoy's "The Kreutzer Sonata" in 1904.

In 1557, the Korean Yi Hwang produced one of the most influential "I Ching" studies of the early modern era, claiming that the spirit was a principle ("li") and not a material force ("qi"). Hwang accused the Neo-Confucian school of having misread Zhu Xi. His critique proved influential not only in Korea but also in Japan. Other than this contribution, the "I Ching" was not central to the development of Korean Confucianism, and by the 19th century, "I Ching" studies were integrated into the "silhak" reform movement.
