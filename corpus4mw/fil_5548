The territory is named after the Échouani Depot, a former logging camp of the Canadian International Paper Company near the confluence of the Chouart and Gatineau Rivers, abandoned since 1962. The name is known since the nineteenth century and several variants have been used on maps and plans: Eshwaham (1873), Eskwahani (1924), Eshwahani (1926), Échouani (1933), as well as Eshawan and Askwahani (dates unknown). The exact origin and significance of this name is unknown, but one possibility is that the word comes from "Echoam", a tributary of the Gatineau, and this in turn is a derivative of "echohamok", which is from the Algonquin language probably meaning "to prepare to leave by water".

The area just to the east of the Cranberry Wilderness is drained by tributaries of the Greenbrier River which flows into the New.
