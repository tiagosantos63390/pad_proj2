Also in 1845, the SER was granted permission to build a line from Ashford, Kent to St Leonards, East Sussex. The LBSC reached St Leonards from in 1846. This gave the LBSC a shorter route to than the SERs route, then still under construction. The SER sought permission to extend their branch from Tunbridge Wells across the High Weald to reach Hastings. Authorisation for the construction of a line to Hastings was obtained on 18 June 1846.

Until the construction of what is now the A419 road along the bottom of the valley in 1815, Thrupp Lane was the main thoroughfare between Stroud and Chalford. The condition of this road was such that it required a whole day for a team of horses to draw a loaded waggon and return, a distance of only four miles each way.

Every issue of "Spidey Super Stories" featured at least one story where Spidey would team up with an established Marvel Comics superhero and/or fight an established Marvel villain. This served to introduce other Marvel characters to new readers who were unfamiliar with the company's characters prior to seeing Spider-Man on "The Electric Company". Most of these stories would feature quick origins, usually taking up a single page or less, of both the featured hero and villain. Guest heroes included Iron Man (on several occasions), Captain America, Doctor Strange, Spider-Woman, Nova, The Cat and Ms Marvel. Guest villains included the Green Goblin, the Blizzard, Jack O'Lantern, and even Thanos.

Glamorgan Dragons recorded a victory at their home ground Sophia Gardens, despite being tied down in mid-match by Sean Ervine and Shaun Udal who took two wickets each and both conceded less than 40 runs. Wicket-keeper Mark Wallace hit one six and one four in a valuable hit-out late on, while Michael Powell had set the pace with 52. Then, Hampshire Hawks were shot down in the chase. David Harrison had John Crawley caught with the second ball of the match, and Andrew Davies followed up, getting Greg Lamb and Ervine caught behind. With James Adams bowled by Harrison, Hampshire had scored seven runs for four wickets, and their lower order never recovered. Jono McLean was the first to hit into double figures, before he too was caught behind off Davies, and Harrison then took two as Hampshire were 33 for 7. Kevin Latouf and Shaun Udal adjusted somewhat, adding 19 for the eighth wicket, but first change bowler Alex Wharf cleaned up them as well, leaving Hampshire all out for 69 – the lowest score of the National League Division One all season, and giving Glamorgan the highest victory by runs in the division all season.
Goffey and Gaz Coombes joined other musicians including Paul Weller to record a charity single called "Consequences" for the charity Crisis.

The success of the Weller Curve project cleared the way for work on the Top Cut, the stretch just below the summit on the western side, which includes the most seriously eroded slopes anywhere in the pass corridor. Lewis had always intended to focus the IPF's efforts on it, and the organization began the first of several ongoing projects there in 1996. Work included the construction of stone retaining walls as well as revegetation. By the 2010s the results were evident.
In 2001, it was announced that 614 would run out of phone numbers, and it was decided that a new area code 380 would be overlaid over 614 with the same geographic boundaries, and 10-digit dialing was made optional. It was planned that after a year, 10-digit dialing would become mandatory and new 380 numbers would be issued. In the intervening time, the growth of fax machines and mobile phones dropped significantly, and new relief efforts such as number pooling were instituted, and it seemed that a new area code would not be necessary in the immediate future. In early 2002, the 380 overlay plan was suspended indefinitely. 10-digit dialing remains optional, and the 380 area code remained reserved for Columbus but not used, .
