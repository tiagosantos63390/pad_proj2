Ginetta Cars announced in November 2010 that they were going to be building a new sports car, and named it as the G55. In February 2011, the car was released, as a more powerful evolution of the G50. The G55 featured a Ford-sourced 3.7 litre V6, producing 370 hp, in addition to a 6-speed sequential manual gearbox, built by Hewland. The new car did not replace the G50; instead, it supplemented it, and the Ginetta G50 Cup was rebranded as the Ginetta GT Supercup. The G55 was available for sale for £75,000, or as an upgrade from the G50 for £25,000. The car made its British GT debut in the Oulton Park rounds of the 2011 season, with four separate entries competing; the best result of the event came courtesy of Century Motorsport, whom took a ninth place finish at the second race of the day. Century Motorsport were also responsible for the car's best finish of the season; a fourth place at Rockingham Motor Speedway, in the first race of the day. A GT3 test mule was run by Rollcentre Racing (using the Cup engine with some GT3-specification components) in the 2011 Britcar 24 Hours; however, the car failed to finish the race.
