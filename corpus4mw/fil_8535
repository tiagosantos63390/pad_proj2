The entire alignment of the monorail is elevated, carried on single pillars generally along the median of the road. Each pillar will take up around 2m on the median. The monorail project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will be from Medical College to Mananchira and the second phase from Mananchira to Meenchantha. Approximately 10.65 hectares of land will be required for the project, of which 80% is government owned land.
The Constitution requires the state to take "reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation" of the right of everyone to have access to housing. In this context, "the state" includes the various legislative and executive organs in all spheres of government. In discharging their obligations, these organs must act consistently with the Constitution and the separation of powers mandated by it. It has been held that the national sphere of government must assume responsibility for ensuring that laws, policies, programs and strategies are adequate to meet the state's obligations in this regard. This, the court found, includes the need to facilitate access to temporary relief for people who have no access to land and no roof over their heads, for people who are living in intolerable conditions, and for people who are in crisis because of natural disasters such as floods and fires, or because their homes are under threat of demolition.
