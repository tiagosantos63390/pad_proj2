History.

Kosciusko was a Polish national who led Poland in rebellion against two countries, Prussia and Russia, during the spring of 1794. When the rebellion was crushed by that October, he was captured by Russian forces and held as a prisoner. Coleridge knew few details about the specifics, and altered his poem when he found out that Kosciusko was merely wounded and captured instead of being killed.

As the BBC reports, "The programme has prompted a mixed reaction in mainly Muslim Turkey, with some saying it would be good for interfaith relations and others saying such discussions were 'inappropriate' for television." Hakkı Devrim, a television commentator and columnist for "Radikal", said the idea insulted religion. "Religion is not a science, and it is not open to discussion," Devrim said in an interview for "Hürriyet", expressing concerns that atheists would receive a forum to express their views. He "advised Kanal T not to take the risk of airing such a show in Turkey". Professor Mustafa Çağrıcı, an Istanbul mufti, has also expressed concerns about religion being discussed on television, worrying that it would confuse people and "have negative consequences". According to the "Jerusalem Post", "Jewish authorities...are vehemently opposed to the program, since according to Halacha, active proselytizing is forbidden." Rabbi David Rosen, director of the American Jewish Committee's Department for Interreligious Affairs, said in an interview about the show, "s a Jew, it is against our world outlook to seek to proselytize". More generally, he stated that he thought the show was "tasteless": "Matters of faith, profession and lifestyle commitment are not something that should be decided on a reality show." However, sociologist Nilüfer Narlı from Bahçeşehir University has said that the show demonstrates a "rising curiosity toward religion" over the past 10 years in Turkey. "The Guardian" and "CBC News" have remarked some people may see the show as promoting a further intolerance towards atheists in Turkey, a secular country where a large majority of the population is deeply religious. The opposition of the ruling Justice and Development Party has accused the show of having a secret "Islamist agenda", which the series has denied.

"Vamps and Tramps: New Essays" (1994) is a collection of 42 short articles and a long essay, "No Law in the Arena: a Pagan Theory of Sexuality". It also contains a collection of cartoons from newspapers about Paglia. Writing for the "New York Times", Wendy Steiner wrote "Comic, camp, outspoken, Ms. Paglia throws an absurdist shoe into the ponderous wheels of academia". Michiko Kakutani, also writing for the "New York Times", wrote: "Her writings on education... are highly persuasive, just as some of her essays on the perils of regulating pornography and the puritanical excesses of the women's movement radiate a fierce common sense... Unfortunately, Ms. Paglia has a way of undermining her more interesting arguments with flip, hyperbolic declarations".
