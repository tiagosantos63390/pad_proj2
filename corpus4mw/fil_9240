Chet Flippo, in an article on the song's history for Country Music Television, said that "It's one song that in its different iterations links past and present. It truly shows the power of a single song." Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song 4 ½ stars out of 5, saying that it "might be the most emotional performance of his career. It’s clear he’s falling back on his own experiences as he tells the story of a man looking for his love and maybe his soul." A less favorable review came from Karlie Justus Marlowe of Engine 145, who said that "The song’s necessary grit and gravel are noticeably missing from his delivery, and everything comes off a little too smooth, a touch too neat and tidy." She also criticized the "heavy" production, and gave the song a "thumbs down".
