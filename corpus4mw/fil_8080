Withrow grew up in Central City, Kentucky and graduated from Central City High School there in 1956, at which time he signed with the Milwaukee Braves.

William B. Caldwell was born on a Butler County, Ohio farm, where he stayed his first 21 years. He entered Miami University at Oxford, Ohio in 1830, and graduated in 1835.

There he formed a partnership with General Samuel F. Cary.
When Deangelo Vickers ends up in a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (guest star Kathy Bates) makes Dwight (Rainn Wilson) the interim regional manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim's chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim (John Krasinski) notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style in stark contrast to their previously relaxed style, from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called "The Fist". In Dwight's office, he claims that the piranha is a rescue, but the fish is actually a red-bellied Pacu. In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam (Jenna Fischer) insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy (Ed Helms), causing him temporary hearing loss. Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying "Shagedelic, baby") at certain promptings.

History.
On April 15, 2014, Shane Gibson died of a blood clotting disorder, at the age of 35.
The queen’s gaster remains contracted for all of the larval-developing stage, reaching no greater than 0.35 mm in diameter. At the onset of spring, she enters physogastry, a phase in which her gaster greatly expands, while the first few larvae show signs of pupation. Her gaster swells with egg-filled ovarioles and grows up to 1.1 mm in diameter. In spite of their size, queens at this stage are very mobile, in contrast to their near motionlessness during the larval-growing stage.

But his reign was short-lived. He was killed in 1487 by another Abyssinian, former loyal Ilyas dynasty army commander, Saifuddin Firuz Shah.
