Smr14C2 sRNA was described by del Val et al., as a result of a computational comparative genomic approach consisting in the integration of complementary strategies, designed to search for novel sRNA-encoding genes in the intergenic regions (IGRs) of the reference "S. meliloti" 1021 strain (http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/bacteria/annotation/cgi/rhime.cgi) . Northern hybridization experiments confirmed that the predicted "smr14C2" locus did express a single transcript of the expected size, which accumulated differentially in free-living and endosymbiotic bacteria. TAP-based 5’-RACE experiments mapped the transcription start site (TSS) of the full-length Smr14C transcript to the 1,667,613 nt position in the S. meliloti 1021 genome (http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/bacteria/annotation/cgi/rhime.cgi) whereas the 3’-end was assumed to be located at the 1,667,491 nt position matching the last residue of the consecutive stretch of Us of a bona fide Rho-independent terminator (Figure 5). Parallel and later studies in which Smr14C2 transcript is referred to as sra38 or Sm7', independently confirmed the expression this sRNA in "S. melilloti" and in its closely related strain 2011. Recent deep sequencing-based characterization of the small RNA fraction (50-350 nt) of "S. meliloti" 2011 further confirmed the expression of Smr14C2 (here referred to as SmelC397), and mapped the 5’- and 3´-ends of the full-length transcript to the same position in the "S. meliloti" 1021 genome.

William Haldane Porter was born on 15 May 1867 at 23 University Square, Belfast within the precincts of Queen's University. His name was given simply as William. The middle name Haldane, by which he was known thereafter, and gave the impression of a combined but unhyphenated double barrelled surname, was added when he was baptised on 30 June 1867 by Rev. Henry Cooke (1788–1868), his maternal grandfather, then President of the Presbyterian College, Belfast and founding Minister of the May Street Presbyterian Church, Belfast. The name Haldane is that of a maternal uncle, Alexander Haldane Cooke (1836–1870), so called after James Alexander Haldane (1768–1851), independent Scottish church leader, preacher, and missionary, with whom Henry Cooke may have been associated theologically many years earlier.

In mathematics, Vojta's conjecture is a conjecture introduced by about heights of points on algebraic varieties over number fields. The conjecture was motivated by an analogy between diophantine approximation and Nevanlinna theory (value distribution theory) in complex analysis. It implies many other conjectures in diophantine approximation theory, diophantine equations, arithmetic geometry, and logic.
