In the 1986 World Figure Skating Championships in Geneva, figure skater Brian Orser was the favorite to earn what would have been his first world title though ultimately did not because of a suboptimal performance. After the championship, Orser contacted Jensen, asking Jensen to be his sports psychologist. Jensen helped Orser relax and focus on the competition by dealing with family issues beforehand and taking lengthy pre-competition walks. One year after Geneva, Orser received a gold medal in the 1987 World Figure Skating Championships in Cincinnati. In a 1988 interview with the "Toronto Star", Orser, who won the silver medal for Canada in that year's Winter Olympics, said, "Peter Jensen is of major importance to my success here because he helps me maintain my mind-set". Orser and Jensen worked together to help Orser overcome stress and distraction. Instead of shunning the media, Orser chose to have daily press conferences.
