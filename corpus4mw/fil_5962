Intuitively, the identity cannot be proved because the high school axioms can't be used to discuss the polynomial formula_3. Reasoning about that polynomial and the subterm formula_4 requires a concept of negation or subtraction, and these are not present in the high school axioms. Lacking this, it is then impossible to use the axioms to manipulate the polynomial and prove true properties about it. Wilkie's results from his paper show, in more formal language, that the "only gap" in the high school axioms is the inability to manipulate polynomials with negative coefficients.

The Beijing government has set two conditions for reestablishing the relations: that the Holy See "not interfere in religious matters in China" and that, in line with Beijing's One-China policy, it break the ties with the Taipei government that it established after the expulsion of Archbishop Riberi, ties that, since the United Nations' recognition of the Beijing government as the government of China, it now maintains only at the level of chargé d'affaires. The Holy See has indicated that it would have no difficulty about the second condition, but requires discussion about the concrete meaning of the first. The main point of contention concerns the appointing of Catholic bishops in mainland China, who are now named by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, at some periods in agreement with the Holy See, at other times in direct opposition to its declared wishes. The PRC government's position is that bishops should be appointed by itself; the Holy See's position is that bishops can only be appointed by the Pope, while envisaging in some cases a form of consultation with the civil authorities.

The village now has various amenities. There is an extremely modern, successful and bilingual primary school, Ysgol Gymunedol Croesgoch. The Chapel is still functioning with services on a fortnightly basis. There are two art galleries run by well-known artists (one being John Knapp-Fisher). There is a garage (Forge Garage) for vehicle maintenance and MOTs and a large farm store (Croesgoch Farm Stores). The local pub, The Artramont Arms, offers takeway meals as well as a friendly drinking environment. It also offers Post Office services. The post office is temporarily closed, but with regular collections. There is a village general carpenter, metal worker and undertaker. Village people are employed in these activities and many travel further afield for their employment and others are employed in holiday and service industries in the locality. A construction company (Carreg Construction) is based in the village and building work is carried out in the village also employing some local people.
