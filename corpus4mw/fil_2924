Treelucerne is also used in mountainous terrain, highlands and marginal areas that are of low agricultural value to normal Alfalfa and cash crop production and therefore still available. Treelucerne grow very well on sloped land as the deep taproot is able to anchor land otherwise prone to erosion under cultivation. The combination of alley cropping with Treelucerne on heavily sloped land enable less suitable blocks of available agricultural land to be farmed effectively in a intensive model, although it takes 2-3 years for the biological fertilisation to become effective. Treelucerne is very valuable as high value nectar and pollen bee forage and used by small and large scale bee farmers.
