The home shirt was a traditional blue and white stripes, complete with white shorts and black socks. The away kit featured a black shirt with red sleeves, and was completed with black shorts and red socks. On 2 August 2013, the Club announced the addition of an all-bright yellow third kit, to be worn the following day at Nottingham Forest. Due to Thornton & Ross's sponsorship of away shirts, Town couldn't wear their Rekorderlig-sponsored home shirt away from home, so this shirt was deemed necessary for away games where black and red could not be worn. These shirts featured the sponsorship of Covonia, one of Thornton & Ross's brands, and 1,000 replicas were produced for sale with profits going to the Huddersfield Town Foundation.
