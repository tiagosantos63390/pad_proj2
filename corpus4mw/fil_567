Corporations may deduct the cost of capital following capital cost allowance regulations. The Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Capital Cost Allowance in a fairly broad manner, allowing deductions on property which was owned for a very brief period of time, and property which is leased back to the vendor from which it originated.

Since Mandalay Sports Entertainment purchased the Erie SeaWolves in 2003, the team has been the object of several relocation rumors. In 2005, investors from Holyoke, Massachusetts hoped to lure the team to a brand new ballpark there. However, the Erie County Convention Center Authority heavily renovated Jerry Uht Park with modern amenities, thus anchoring the SeaWolves in Erie through 2012. In 2009, officials from Richmond, Virginia speculated that the SeaWolves would replace the departing Richmond Braves (now the Gwinnett Braves) in time for the 2010 season. Yet, it was the former Connecticut Defenders that filled the void. In 2011, representatives from Ottawa posited that the Canadian capital city would gain the Erie SeaWolves after their contracts for Jerry Uht Park and the Detroit Tigers end prior to the 2013 season. Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. weighed in on the rumor in November 2011 and pleaded for Mandalay Sports Entertainment to keep the SeaWolves in Erie. In his plea, Senator Casey remarked, "The SeaWolves are an important part of the region’s economy, and it’s absolutely essential they stay in Erie and not move to Ottawa. In 2005, County of Erie taxpayers made a multi-million dollar commitment to improving the stadium; the team’s ownership should honor that commitment and keep the team where it belongs, in Erie." In April 2012, the Tigers extended their Player Development Contract with the SeaWolves through the 2014 season. Dan Lunetta, the Tigers' director of minor league operations, stated:

History.
Muhsin Al-Hakim led the hawza, also known as the marja'iyya, the group of Shi'i scholars based in Najaf responsible for determining Shi'i religious doctrine, during a time of considerable tumult in Iraq. Communism had enveloped the south of Iraq, Iraqi nationalist parties (and most prominently the pan-Arabist Ba'ath party) were largely in control of Iraq's political institutions, particularly during the last decade of Hakim's life. It is important to note, however, that the hawza is not a papacy and that therefore "leading" it does not mean that Hakim alone could pronounce Shi'i doctrine, all members of the hawza of sufficient standing (namely, those given the title absolute interpreter, or mujtahid mutlaq) developed their own rules based on accepted techniques and practices. Hakim was simply the most respected of the relatively small group of scholars.

At their Yearly Meeting in 2009, the Quakers decided to recognise opposite-sex and same-sex marriages equally and perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, making them the first mainstream religious body in Britain to do so. Under the current law registrars are not allowed to legally officiate a marriage between same-sex couples but the Quakers stated that the law does not preclude them from "playing a central role in the celebration and recording of same-sex marriages" and asked the government to change the law so that these marriages would be recognised. In a joint press release in 2012, the Quakers, Liberal Jews, and Unitarians and Free Christians gave their endorsement to the same-sex marriage consultation.
Japan levies a tax based on engine displacement, and Japanese auto manufacturers have correspondingly focused their research and development efforts toward improving the performance of smaller engine designs through means other than displacement increases. One method for increasing performance into a static displacement includes forced induction, as with models such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX which used turbocharger applications and the Toyota MR2 which used a supercharger for some model years. Another approach is the rotary engine used in the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8. A third option is to change the cam timing profile, of which Honda VTEC was the first successful commercial design for altering the profile in real-time.
Players roll two standard dice and may then move up to that number of squares. Players may move over a square occupied by another player if the occupying player grants permission, but may not occupy the same square. Doors, monsters and other objects are placed on the board by the evil wizard player according to line of sight. Once placed on the board they are not removed unless killed, thereby providing a steady stream of monsters for the evil wizard player to utilize.

A note on "Self Love" - the term used by Taylor to denote a natural part of man's being, whereby a person has a natural desire for happiness that motivates all choices and which will manifest itself in Godly repentance when given the opportunity. This is based on the belief that the Christian life, if understood, would be so attractive, wonderful and beneficial for the person that his or her natural inclination would be to convert, something within his or her power to do according to this theology.
