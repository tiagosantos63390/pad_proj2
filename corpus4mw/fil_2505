Rabbi Eleazar taught that Miriam died with a Divine kiss, just as Moses would. As says, “So Moses the servant of the Lord died "there" in the land of Moab by the mouth of the Lord,” and says, “And Miriam died "there"” — both using the word “there” — Rabbi Eleazar deduced that both Moses and Miriam died the same way. Rabbi Eleazar explained that does not say that Miriam died “by the mouth of the Lord” because it would be indelicate to say so.

This work supposedly provides omitted details concerning the prophet Jeremiah. It is preserved in Coptic, Arabic, and Garshuni manuscripts, though it was most likely originally written in Greek sometime between 70 to 132 CE by a Jewish author. In the Coptic version it is entitled "Paralipomena Jeremiae" and was most likely used or reworked by the author of the more widely known Greek work by that name. 
This is tale IV in Pitrè, "Nuovo Saggio di Fiabe" (1873). The "manu pagana", or a "heathen hand", in Sicilian superstition refers to "the hand of an unbaptized child or of a strange servant who steals secretly." In this version, there are seven daughters, and the last one eats the hand by pounding it into a pill she can swallow. The antagonist is called "Zu Drau" (Uncle Dragon)

However, it is uncertain as to whether the similarities between Jung's psychological teachings and those of the Gnostics are due to their sharing a "perennial philosophy", or whether Jung was unwittingly influenced by the Gnostics in the formation of his theories. Jung's own 'gnostic hymn', the "Septem Sermones ad Mortuos" (The Seven Sermons to the Dead), would tend to imply the latter, but after circulating the manuscript, Jung declined to publish it during his lifetime. Since it is not clear whether Jung was ultimately displeased with the book or whether he merely suppressed it as too controversial, the issue remains contested.

Pastore helped himself with an RBI sacrifice fly to center in the bottom of the second that scored Dan Driessen. Driessen was aboard after singling and moving to third on a Ray Knight single. In the top of the third, Tim Foli and Dave Parker led off with singles. Willie Stargell followed with a base hit to right, but he rounded first base too far and Reds right fielder Dave Collins threw behind him. Stargell was caught in a rundown and retired. Foli, however, surprisingly stayed at third instead of trying to score while Stargell was in the rundown. John Milner was walked intentionally, loading the bases, and Bill Madlock beat out a double-play grounder to score Foli with the tying run.
