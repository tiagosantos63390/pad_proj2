Sphenophyllalean taxonomy is often derived from isolated fossilized parts of plants and classification may be based on the morphology and anatomy of sterile plant parts (like leaves) or fructifications (mainly the fossilized cones and the stratigraphically-important spores found near them). This results in species that may actually by synonymous.

Midway through the first quarter, Alabama's Willie Shelby fumbled a punt that was recovered by Notre Dame's Al Samuel at the Crimson Tide 16-yard line. Five plays later, the Irish scored on a 4-yard Wayne Bullock touchdown run to take a 7–0 lead. Their lead was extended to 13–0 midway through the second quarter after Mark McLane scored on a 9-yard touchdown run to cap a 17-play, 77-yard drive. A 21-yard field goal by Danny Ridgeway cut the lead to 13–3 at the half. After a scoreless third, the Crimson Tide scored a late touchdown on a 48-yard Richard Todd touchdown pass to Russ Schamun, and with a successful two-point conversion closed the gap to 13–11. After a defensive stop, Alabama again got the ball on offense and was driving for a game-winning score when Todd threw an interception to Reggie Barnett effectively ending the comeback for the Tide.

Juan García de Miranda was born of Asturian parents at Madrid, and studied painting under Juan Delgado, producing chiefly devotional pictures, particularly "Immaculate Conception"s, for private patrons. Born without a right hand, he made use of the stump of the arm to hold pencils, maulstick, &c. He was appointed to clean and restore the pictures injured in the fire at the Alcazar, and acquitted himself so well as to be appointed, in 1735, painter-in-ordinary to Philip V. He also held, with Palomino, from 1724, the post of public valuer of pictures. He died in 1749, leaving a son Juan, of great promise as a painter, who, however, died at the age of twenty-one. His brother and disciple, Nicolas Garcia de Miranda, who was born in 1698, and died in 1738, painted landscapes with religious figures.

After the scare of 1457, when French troops successfully attacked the town of Sandwich on the south coast, Southampton Castle was once again put on alert, and one of Henry VI's more "dependable captains", Nicholas Carew, was given control of the castle for life. Despite investment in the castle declining, the antiquarian John Leland could describe the new keep in the early 16th century as being "the glory of the castle, both large and fair and very strong, both by works and by the site of it".
At the break of dawn, the Swedes had learned of the Norwegian defensive line and commenced their battle plan to evict them from their entrenchment. The Swedish troops were sent forth in columns from a small rise where Langnes Station on the Østfold Line is today, about half a kilometre from the Norwegian lines. The open fields between the small rise and the cannon battery gave the Norwegian field artillery a good field of fire. The fields, being sodden by the nights rain, slowed the Swedish advance in front of the Norwegian guns. Colonel Hegermann ordered his men to hold the fire until the Swedes had advanced right up to the entrenchment, allowing the cannons to fire into the side of the advancing column with canister shots. Hegermann later described how shots from the Norwegian cannons "«[...]made it look like a wagon had rolled through them from head to queue»".
