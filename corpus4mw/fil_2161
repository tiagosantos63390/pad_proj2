Human genes.
There was, amongst the Salwas, a virtuous Kshatriya king known by the name of Dyumatsena. And it came to pass that in course of time he became blind. And that blind king possessed of wisdom had an only son. And it so happened that an old enemy dwelling in the vicinity, taking advantage of the king’s mishap, deprived him of his kingdom. And thereupon the monarch, accompanied by his wife bearing a child on her breast, went into the woods. His son, born in the city, began to grow in the hermitage. The Brahmanas have named the son Satyavan. In his childhood he took great delight in horses, and used to make horses of clay. And he used also to draw pictures of horses. And for this that youth is sometimes called by the name of Chitraswa. The Madra princess Savitri knew about this prince and fell in love with him. Later she married him. Dyumatsena's minister somehow slew the enemy king and Dyumatesena regained his kingdom.
The five Kekaya brothers are lying on the ground, slain by Drona. Their coats of mail, of the splendour of heated gold, and their tall standards and cars and garlands, all made of the same metal, are shedding a bright light on the earth like so many blazing fires. (11,25)

These pigeons are kept and bred for their aerial performance and for reproduction. Racing homers are a type of Homing pigeon, trained to participate in the sport of pigeon racing, and have been used to carry messages during times of war. Such races often have large cash prizes of up to $1,000,000.00 as the Sun City Million Dollar Pigeon Race. Fanciers who fly racing pigeons sometimes win long-distance races and even break records. Other flying/sporting pigeons are bred for unique flying characteristics other than homing, such as rolling, high-flying, and diving. These birds, which may be flown in competitions, include but are not limited to Rollers, Tumblers, and Tipplers. It should also be noted that a few varieties, for example, the Parlor Roller, are considered to be within the flying/sporting group even though they do not fly. This is because they compete on the basis of their performance and not their appearance.

In mathematics, the generalized minimal residual method (usually abbreviated GMRES) is an iterative method for the numerical solution of a nonsymmetric system of linear equations. The method approximates the solution by the vector in a Krylov subspace with minimal residual. The Arnoldi iteration is used to find this vector.
Why Social Preferences Matter.
The filmmakers were given three conditions: to make a film in digital format, no longer than 30 minutes, and using a limited production budget. The three films construct one feature-length film entitled N, representing Next Generation, New Technology and Networking which are the common themes. Projects like Short Digital Films by Three Filmmakers, which focus on film production, creativity, and interactive technology, reflect the spirit of JIFF as they explore the zeitgeist of contemporary film.

Bliss' main power is the ability to stimulate a person's neural system to an incredible state of ecstasy or agony, even to the point of cardiac arrest. She also possesses some psionic powers such as advanced telepathy and minor telekinesis but only uses them on rare occasions. Her natural ability as a seductress is usually the only power Bliss ever needs.

Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997 [http://www.transmitter.com/FCC97115/chanplan.html], the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television signal. On January 15, 2009, KUPU shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 15, on January 15, 2009, the date in which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (six months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland).
Nsimalen International Airport is equipped with modern facilities and can be accessed through 4 gates. It has 6 parking facilities, 2 of which are for long term use.

The section of line across the viaduct and on to Usan is the only single track section on the entire line between Edinburgh & Aberdeen - though the rest of the route was doubled by the NBR in the years after opening, the cost of widening or rebuilding the viaduct to accommodate double track was deemed prohibitive and so it remained single. Until recently, the section was worked by signal boxes at each end ("Usan" and "Montrose South") using tokenless block regulations, but a 2010 resignalling scheme saw both boxes closed and control transferred to the former "Montrose North" box - this now supervises the entire area including the single line over the viaduct. The work also made the southbound platform at the station bi-directional.

Damage to the superior parietal lobule can cause contralateral astereognosis and hemispatial neglect. It is also associated with deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes. 
However in 1997, Vittorio Palmieri, Kurt Borer, Stefan Janos, Cinzia Da Viá and Luca Casagrande at the University of Bern (Switzerland) found out that at temperatures below 130 kelvin (about −143 degrees Celsius), dead detectors apparently come back to life. The explanation of this phenomenon, known as the Lazarus effect, is related to the dynamics of the induced defects in the semiconductor bulk.
High Island got its name from a large, perched sand dune on the western side of the island. The sand, blown by the lake's prevailing winds, has piled up into a sand dune elevated 780 feet (238 m) above sea level, or 199 feet (61 m) above the level of Lake Michigan.

The benefits listed below for AISH recipients can be all or partially given to each client, based on need and on the discretion of the AISH Director. Also, as long as the AISH client has personal total net assets of less than C$100,000 (NOT including the assets of the primary residence AND mode of transportation, like a car), these benefits can be given to him/her. To verify that the AISH benefits are given to the properly-selected clients, an "honor system" financial update must be given to his/her assigned AISH worker every calendar year. In other words, the AISH recipient must declare any monetary assets (like a savings account, bonds, etc.) and a given month's bank statements of transactions, in which an AISH base amount was deposited into.
Fito Cabrales, former vocalist to Spanish rock group Platero y Tú, left the reasonably successful group in 1998 in search of a new sound. Cabrales formed his own group, calling it Fito & Fitipaldis. Striving to synthesize such elements as soul, pop, swing, flamenco, Tex-Mex, and Latin jazz, Cabrales claims that "everything has a place in this emotional, complex-free music." Signing with DRO Atlantic, Fito & Fitipaldis released their first disc, A Puerta Cerrada (A Closed Door) in 1998, and their second, Los sueños locos (The Crazy Dreams) in 2001. The group's 2003 release, Lo más lejos a tu lado (The Farthest from Your Place) achieved great success, reaching number two on the national charts during its first two weeks, and exceeding sales projections considerably. Cabrales and friends toured extensively throughout Spain and beyond, playing some of Europe's most important venues. In 2006 Fito & Fitipaldis released Por la boca vive el pez (Fish Live by the Mouth) and are now among Spain's most popular performing artists. Cabrales' free-spirited approach to songwriting is easily summarized: "I would like everybody to understand these songs their own way. They are just songs. So much work, so much worrying, so much thinking about them and finally...they are just songs."

Political career.

The company’s business practices are not without controversy, however. In 2012, Clif Bar came under fire for not disclosing where they source their chocolate from. According to the nonprofit Food Empowerment Project (F.E.P.), two West African countries, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, supply 75 percent of the world’s cocoa market. In recent years, a handful of organizations and journalists have exposed the widespread use of child labor and, in some cases, slavery on West African cocoa farms. Volunteers with F.E.P. contact companies that make vegan products containing chocolate to find out if they source their cocoa beans from areas where slavery can still be found. F.E.P. first contacted Clif Bar in May 2011, and the company has refused to disclose the source of its chocolate. The nonprofit launched a campaign in March 2012 asking consumers to contact Clif Bar and demand transparency in light of the possible connection to child labor and human slavery. On March 5, 2012, Clif Bar & Company announced that "100 percent of cocoa ingredients for CLIF Bar will be sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms."
