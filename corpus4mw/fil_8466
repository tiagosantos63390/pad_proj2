Commands in the DOS version of Skyglobe are mostly keystroke-based, and by default the available keys are listed on the screen for reference. Keys exist to adjust the viewer's location, viewing direction, and time (all of which are shown on the display by default), and to control how many objects are rendered. There is also a zoom control, and a function to search for particular objects. If the object being searched for is not currently above the horizon but will be in the next 24 hours, Skyglobe will adjust the time appropriately.
The crew of the "Titanic" then see the iceberg and attempt to avoid it, but the "Titanic" hits the berg anyway, due to the sharks blocking the rudder. The "Titanic" then quickly begins to sink, and the dolphins berate Tentacles for endangering the hundreds of lives on board the Titanic, and then Tentacles runs to the Titanic in an attempt to stall for time for the passengers who were still on board the Titanic to escape the ship, including Captain Edward Smith.
