A highly anticipated album, "Universus" was released in 26 April 2013 in Australia and on 29 April in the rest of the world. The album became overall number one album in Australia on its first day of release. It contains 14 songs in dance genres such as drum and bass, electro house, and dubstep. Collaborations include Phetsta, Reija Lee (ShockOne's sister), Metrik, Kyza, and Sam Nafie. Karl Thomas (ShockOne) said of the title: "The loose theme of "Universus" is the lifespan of our universe. The term itself, 'universus', actually means everything right now. It's dealing with, as humans, our perception of reality and how we deal with the universe that we're in."
