Sissy/Cili - Willy's pet cat. In the original version of the film, Sissy saw Willy as a meal after he was turned into a sparrow. She becomes the primary antagonist in the film, wanting to eat Willy instead of helping the Sparrow Guardian teach the boy a valuable lesson, and attempted to eat him in some parts of the movie. In the end, Sissy reconciled and was taught a lesson about respecting living creatures, including sparrows, along with Willy (she is shown releasing the other sparrows instead of eating them). In the English version, Sissy came after Willy because she wanted to teach him a lesson and also settle a score with him for tormenting her at the beginning of the film.

AOL purchased CompuServe in 1997 and retooled its AOL Games Channel in a way that placed Kesmai unfavorably compared to its own games division, WordPlay. Kesmai sued AOL for monopolistic practices. The suit was settled out of court with undisclosed terms.
