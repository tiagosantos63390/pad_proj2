Power outage duration is a measure of the reliability of supply to the distribution networks. This measure decreased for most regions in Honduras from 2001. However, in 2005, a general increase in the interruption duration happened. The total duration of interruptions per connection (36 hours per year in 2005, compared to 24 hours in 2004, but 135 hours in 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch) is about twice as high as the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (14 hours per connection in 2005). However, the frequency of such interruptions has been higher in other countries, meaning that Honduras has a few long outages, while other countries have more frequent shorter ones.

The Ulm tramway opened two lines to the Ulm station forecourt on 15 May 1897. While one tram line linked the stations of Ulm and Neu-Ulm, the other ran on the ring around the city centre. Construction of the Zingler Bridge that crosses the tracks south of the station gave the residents of the suburbs lying to the west of the station a connection to the Ulm trams that they had long demanded. The tram crossed the bridge and continued to Söflingen from 18 October 1906. On 14 May 1947, an Ulm trolleybus service was put into operation; its two lines had a stop at Ulm station. It replaced tramline 2 to Neu-Ulm, which had been closed on the 24 December 1944 due to the effects of the war. On 23 October 1963, the trolleybus operation was abandoned and replaced by diesel buses. Starting from 22 May 1967, Ulm tramline 1 used the Ehinger-Tor underpass, completed in 1966, from Donaustadion to Söflingen instead of the Zingler bridge. On 21 March 2009, line 1 was extended from Donauhalle to Böfingen.

The Crown prince, however, had no intention to allow Juliana and her son to continue their rule. He managed to make his insane father sign an order dismissing the supporters of Juliana Maria from the council and declaring than no royal order was now legal unless co-signed by the Crown Prince. During his first session with the council, he fired the government loyal to Juliana without warning and appointed his own officials, which ended all of the influence of the old regime in one blow, and the regency of Juliana and her son was thereby ended. At the following ball, however, the people involved acted as if nothing had happened, and gave the impression that no coup had taken place. She was taken with great surprise by the coup of 1784. In 1785, King Gustav III of Sweden suggested that she depose the crown prince regent, but she declined. Juliana lived the rest of her life discreetly at the court.
