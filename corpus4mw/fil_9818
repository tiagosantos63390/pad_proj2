In July 1970, the first District Superintendent Joseph Barr passed away with James A. Vitany replaces him. The school was cited by the Michigan Bureau of School Services in 1972 for not having a six hour day at the high school and may have losted its accreditation. The high school's capacity was 800 but with 1,100 students, the district used a split-schedule to deal with the overcrowding. The accreditation for the district was not removed.

"Rhodohypoxis  baurii" is not uncommon in cultivation. It is not reliably frost hardy, so is often grown in pots, protected in the winter. Various colour forms are available under cultivar names, e.g. 'Ruth' (pure white), 'Allbrighton' (pink) and 'Douglas' (red). Some other species, such as "R. milloides", and hybrids with "Hypoxis" species are also grown.

The Norwayne Historic District is bisected by Venoy Road, which runs north-south; Grand Traverse Street, which meanders roughly east-west, serves as a main trunkline for the neighborhood. Cross-streets and half-circle courts extend from Grand Traverse; the residential structures all face onto these cross-streets and courts, set back a consistent distance from the street. Streets in the subdivision are primarily curvilinear, following the Federal Housing Administration guidelines published in the late 1930s. Commercial and public buildings are located on or near Venoy Road, with the exception of the elementary schools, which are located at the east and west ends of the neighborhood.
