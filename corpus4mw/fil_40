Year 535 (DXXXV) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Belisarius without colleague (or, less frequently, year 1288 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 535 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Racks are available with either four or two vertical posts. "Four-post racks" allow for mounting rails to support the equipment at the front and rear. These racks may be open in construction (similar to the traditional open-style two-post racks), or may be enclosed by front and/or rear doors, side panels, or tops. "Two-post racks" provide just two vertical posts; a piece of equipment can be mounted either via its front panel holes, or close to its center of gravity (to minimize load on its front panel), depending on the design of the rack. Two-post racks are most often used for telecommunication installations.
