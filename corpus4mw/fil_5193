The Ultimate Marvel Universe version of Norman Osborn was rendered by artist Mark Bagley to resemble actor Brian Dennehy, as per writer Brian Michael Bendis' instructions. This version is a corrupt industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D., an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife and son Harry Osborn. In "Ultimate Spider-Man" #1, an OZ-injected spider bites Peter Parker on a field trip. Peter develops amazing powers, and Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA gave Parker the abilities of a spider, then if Norman were to receive OZ combined with his "own" DNA, he could become a heightened version of himself. He acquires a sample of Peter's blood. The experiment goes wrong and an explosion occurs, affecting Harry and Dr. Otto Octavius.
