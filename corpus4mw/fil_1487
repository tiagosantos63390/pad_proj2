Performance.
Macrinus had fought an indecisive battle with the Parthians and signed an agreement with the Parthians that many people thought was unfavourable to Rome. Macrinus then made the mistake of cutting pay for the legionnaires. This prompted Legio III "Gallica" to hail Elagabalus as emperor on 16 May 218. Other legionnaires soon joined Elagabalus ranks prompted by discontent over pay. Macrinus sent a cavalry force led by Ulpinus Julianus, but the cavalry killed Ulpinus and joined Elagabalus.
