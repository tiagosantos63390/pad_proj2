Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed by bassist Steve Harris in 1975. The band's first album, 1980's "Iron Maiden" was written primarily by Harris, with vocalist Paul Di'Anno co-writing two tracks and guitarist Dave Murray contributing "Charlotte the Harlot". The 1981 follow-up, "Killers", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, "Killers" (North American bonus track "Twilight Zone" was credited to Harris and Murray). Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of "Killers", although did not contribute any songwriting to "The Number of the Beast", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. "The Number of the Beast" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of "Run to the Hills", which charted at number seven upon its release. It was not until 1983's "Piece of Mind" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned "Flight of Icarus" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock chart.
In the 1983-84 season “The Red Bulls” after beating BK TJ Inter Bratislava (88-80 and 83-91) played in the third round of the same competition where they were eliminated by Pallacanestro Virtus Roma (93-55 in Rome, 69-78 in Tirana). Virtus would than win the Champion Clubs’ Cup that season. Again with this result B.C. Partizani Tirana was among the best twelve teams of the competition.
