At the end of July, Preserve was sent to compete at Goodwood Racecourse where she was entered in four events. On the opening day she ran in the Drawing Room Stakes in which she was set to concede four pounds to the Riddlesworth Stakes winner Oak-Apple. Ridden again by Flatman, she won by two lengths from the colt Outcast with Oak-Apple, who was favoured in the betting, finishing third. On the following day Preserve had two engagements, beginning with the Verulam Stakes in which she was allowed to walk over the one mile course for a Â£100 prize after her opponents were withdrawn by their owners. Later the same day, Preserve started 9/2 second favourite for the Goodwood Stakes, an all-aged handicap run over a distance of three miles. Carrying a weight of 108 pounds, she finished second of the fourteen runners, beaten a length the Ascot Gold Cup winner Glaucus. She appeared to be a very unlucky loser, having been badly hampered when making her challenge inside the final furlong. Two days later Preserve reappeared in the one mile Racing Sweepstakes and won by ten lengths from her only opponent, a colt named Gladiator.
