Initially assigned to overseas service, "Gazelle" participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903. She returned to German waters in 1904, and served with the fleet until 1914. She was employed as a coastal defense ship after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. She served in this role until the night of 25–26 January 1916, when she was mined off Cape Arkona. Deemed not worthy of repairs, "Gazelle" was reduced to a minelayer hulk, a role she served in through the end of the war. In August 1920, she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.
