The Kingsbury House is a historic house at 137 Suffolk Street in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. The oldest part of this 2 1/2 story timber frame may have been built as early as 1686; its exterior styling suggests a construction date in the early 18th century, but the earlier structure may have been incorporated in new construction at that time. The house is one a few First Period houses in Newton, and was associated for many years in the 19th century with the Kingsbury family, who were major landowners in the Chestnut Hill area.

A source close to Hamas described the movement's tactic of launching projectiles from between homes during the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflict: "They fired rockets in between the houses and covered the alleys with sheets so they could set the rockets up in five minutes without the planes seeing them. The moment they fired, they escaped, and they are very quick." Videos released by Hamas in 2011 show Qassam rockets being fired from residential areas and mosques. According to "Yedioth Aharonoth" journalist Elior Levy, "Gaza terror cells choose to fire from urban areas knowing that the Israel Defense Forces refrain from intercepting them for fear of hurting civilians. The killing of civilians in Gaza also serves the terrorists' purposes who claim Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza".
