Oktoberfest is the world's largest funfair held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany.

October 20, Ukrainian Parliament voted to amend Ukraine's Constitution (390 out of 438 in favor) to remove provision related to Parliamentary immunity that prevents a member of parliament from being criminally liable, detained or arrested without the consent of the Verkhovna Rada. An earlier proposal to only remove immunity from the Parliament was defeated. The proposed new provisions also limits presidential immunity. The president can not be detained or arrested without the consent of the parliament however on conviction of an offense the President automatically loses office. The proposed amendments have been forwarded to Ukraine's Constitutional Court for review and will need to be reaffirmed by the parliament in February 2010 
The "director's cut" ending: the Russian Dog, distraught over Bugs' "death" , wishes he were dead too, and Bugs obliges by pulling out a gun and shooting the dog through the mouth. Bugs then dances away, and the dog gets up to deliver the last line: This shouldn't happen to a dog". was never shown in theaters or on television, despite that the episode of Cartoon Network's "The Bob Clampett Show" that aired "Hare Ribbin" with its general release ending mentioned that "Hare Ribbin" had an alternate ending (this one) that was never shown, and due to its violence, never will be. The director's cut version was first discovered on the fifth volume of the "The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5" laserdisc set and the entire cartoon with the director's cut part is now on the fifth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD set as a special feature.

While his reputation is somewhat overshadowed by that of his brilliant, pious and short-lived pupil Honinbo Shusaku, it is undecided and to an extent imponderable who was the stronger, the typical playing conditions of the time meaning that they did not test this in matches played purely as competition. Shusaku's games having been published soon after his death, they became a training manual, adding to the impression of the pupil's level. Shusaku possessed an unusual modesty, and would always take black against out of respect for his teacher, even upon reaching 7-dan. Shuwa played a famous 17 game series with Shusaku between 1846 and 1847, which contained some of the best Go of the classical era. Taking white in all games, Shuwa lost the series 4-13, and his overall results against Shusaku were 6-17-1, but in light of the handicaps and Shusaku's natural brilliance at the Go board, it is virtually impossible to compare the two players.
