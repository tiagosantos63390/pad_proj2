During the early 1900s, reconstructions of subfossil lemurs were poor interpretation due to misattributions of postcranial bones. Although other paleontologists had begun correcting misattributed bones and issues of synonymy, Lamberton fixed more misattributions and poor interpretations of subfossil lemur remains than any other paleontologist. In 1947, he correctly identified the postcranial remains of the sloth lemur, "Palaeopropithecus", which Guillaume Grandidier had mistakenly attributed to a giant tree sloth he called "Bradytherium". Ten years later, in 1957, he wrote a crushing rebuttal to Italian paleontologist Giuseppe Sera by pointing out many skeletal misattributions and tactfully refuting his misinterpretation of the koala lemur ("Megaladapis") as a ray-like swimmer and his fancifully creative "arboreal-aquatic acrobat" theory for "Palaeopropithecus". Both Lamberton and British paleontologist Alice Carleton showed that "Palaeopropithecus" was suspensory; however, Carleton proposed that "Palaeopropithecus" was sloth-like, while Lamberton predicted locomotion more similar to that of an orangutan. It wasn't until the late 1900s that subfossil discoveries demonstrated that "Palaeopropithecus" was more sloth-like.
His first wife was Sarah E. Beck, who died in April 1893. He was then married in July 1905 to Fidelia A. Anderson, who was at that time the principal of Washington-street School. The wedding of the "well-known school teacher" to Beck, who was "about twenty-five years" her senior, came as a "great surprise," the "Los Angeles Times" reported, adding: "That the wedding was unexpected in some quarters is indicated by the fact that Miss Anderson was named by the Board of Education only a week or so to continue as principal. In those days the policy of the Los Angeles School Board was that married teachers had to resign their positions.
