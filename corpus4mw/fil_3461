Cell-penetrating peptide facilitated translocation is a topic of great debate. Evidence has been presented that translocation could use several different pathways for uptake. In addition, the mechanism of translocation can be dependent on whether the peptide is free or attached to cargo. The quantitative uptake of free or CPP connected to cargo can differ greatly but studies have not proven whether this change is a result of translocation efficiency or the difference in translocation pathway. It is probable that the results indicate that several CPP mechanisms are in competition and that several pathways contribute to CPP internalization.

In the research to be carried out at the MCISB, the baker's yeast ("Saccharomyces cerevisiae") will initially be used as a model organism, because it is highly amenable to genetic manipulations and to high-throughput technologies, thus offering an excellent starting position for demonstrating the principles and methods of Systems Biology.
