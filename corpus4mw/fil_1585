The Vanisher is a mutant that possesses the ability to teleport himself, his clothes, and an as yet undetermined amount of additional mass. Apparently the Vanisher traverses the Darkforce dimension when teleporting from one place on Earth to another. His power appears to be psionic in nature. The limits on the Vanisher's teleportational range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he can teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York State without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious extrasensory ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to. This allows Vanisher to teleport with greater ease than Nightcrawler. His powers once interacted with those of Nightcrawler, sending them both into alternate dimensions.

While still in detention, The Tipton Three had filed "habeas corpus" petitions, which were consolidated under "Rasul v. Bush" (2004). All the detainees had been prevented from seeing or contacting legal counsel and challenging their detention before a tribunal, under "habeas corpus." Two other major cases of "habeas corpus" petitions were consolidated under "Rasul v. Bush," including "Habib v. Bush" and "Al-Odah v. United States". In a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court, made in June 2004 after their release, it determined that detainees were covered by the jurisdiction of US courts and had constitutional rights, including the right to counsel and to "habeas corpus". Following that, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) devised the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) to evaluate whether detainees qualified as enemy combatants, and military commissions to try charges against them. CSRTs were held beginning in 2004.
In addition to running a fiscally sound company with packed houses, its deficit reduced by two-thirds, and exciting productions such as the city's first "Thaïs" in 1976, another of George London's major achievements was the renaming of the company, first announced in "The Washington Post" on 13 May 1977. As described by Phillips-Matz, "at this point in the company's history, the programming was smart, varied, and exciting" but progress was suddenly brought to a halt by the July 1977 heart attack suffered by George London. He was never able to return to the company, but his legacy was that "by giving it a new name, a fresh image, and a lot of heft, he brought the company into the national and international opera scene and put it on the road to top rank of producing organizations."

In 1994, a $10 million civil lawsuit was filed against Sogyal Rinpoche. It was alleged that he had used his position as a spiritual leader to induce one of his female students to have sexual relations with him. The complaint included accusations of infliction of emotional distress, breach of fiduciary duty, as well as assault and battery. The lawsuit was settled out of court. Related allegations were later introduced by journalist Mary Finnigan, who was also the main author of the original article in 1995.

Some foolish men declare that Creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If god created the world, where was he before creation? If you say he was transcendent then, and needed no support, where is he now?
Q96 began life on 1 September 1992, broadcasting from Paisley as a local radio station for Paisley, and Renfrewshire. Despite being centralised on Paisley, Scotland's largest town, the many commuters from Renfrewshire into Glasgow, as well as Glasgow and Dunbartonshire's proximity allowed the signal to be easily received in those areas and as such it received listeners from these areas.

Truby's first book "The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller" was published in October, 2007 by Faber and Faber.
