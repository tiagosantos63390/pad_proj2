At the start of gameplay, players are passed out "Character cards" which correspond to matching pawns on the board. Since there are 12 characters, it is often the case that players control more than one character. However, which player controls which character is not revealed. Along with the character cards, there are also Portrait Cards, which determine who the current favorite for the inheritance is, and Trap Cards, which are used to spring traps and knock off other players.
Bence, a Welshman, was born near Bristol, the son of a farmer and meat purveyor. He went to school in Newport, Monmouthshire, but left school when he was 14. After working at first as an articled clerk to a solicitor, he moved into engineering with an apprenticeship at Ashworth, Son and Company who made weighing machines. He later became a weighing machine manager; during the depression of the 1930s he went back into farming, but in 1938 he moved to Birmingham to go back into the skilled engineering trade.
