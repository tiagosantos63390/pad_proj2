The original subdivision of Hawthorndene was created by A.E. and D.J. Hewett on part sections 871-2, Hundred of Adelaide in 1925; however, it was not until 1988 that its boundaries were completely formalised. Its name refers to the many Hawthorn bushes growing along Minno Creek as a result of seeds being washed down the creek from the Hawthorn maze in the Belair National Park and from a Hawthorn hedge planted by C. Legh Winser around his orchard in what is now Glenalta. When the majority of the population and houses that are there now were put in, the suburb was called "Blackwood Estate".
