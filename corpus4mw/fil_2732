The generally positive reception of the premiere persuaded Arthur Bliss, then serving as the BBC's director of music, to arrange a broadcast performance of the work. This took place on 10 January 1945 shortly after which, in February, Tippett conducted the work at the Royal Albert Hall. The radio broadcast had been heard by Howard Hartog, a music writer and publisher who just after the war was in Occupied Germany, attempting to re-establish the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg. As part of this endeavour he decided to mount a performance of "A Child of Our Time", with Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt conducting. Because of his pacifism and record as a conscientious objector, Tippett was not allowed into the occupied zone and thus missed the performance. However, in 1947 he was able to travel to Budapest where his friend, the Hungarian composer Mátyás Seiber, had organised a performance by Hungarian Radio. The local singers' problems with the English text meant that the work was sung in Hungarian, which Tippett, who conducted, described as "a very odd experience".

It is unclear whether Ida Dalser first met young Benito Mussolini in Trento (where he had found his first job as a journalist in 1909) or in Milan (where he had moved soon afterwards). The two started a relationship and when Mussolini was refused work on the basis of his fervent socialist political activity, she financed him with the revenues of her beautician job. According to some sources, they married in 1914, and in 1915 she bore him his first child, Benito Albino Mussolini. Though the records of this marriage were destroyed by Mussolini's government, an edict from the city of Milan ordering Mussolini to make maintenance payments to “his wife Ida Dalser” and their child was overlooked.
Quierzy was already a significant stronghold of Neustria recorded in events in the Chronicle of Fredegar at the opening of the seventh century, when Protadius, the mayor of the palace of Burgundy was the noble lover of Brunhilda, the grandmother of and regent for King Theuderic II. Brunhilda pressured her grandson to go to war against her other grandson, Theudebert II of Austrasia, but when Theuderic assembled the army at Quierzy in 606, the men did not want to fight their fellow Franks: Protadius was promptly killed by the warriors, who forced the king to sign a treaty.

The final derby with John Aloisi in charge of the Heart took place with both teams desperate for a win. Heart had not won a match since a 3-1 win over Sydney in February 2013, and Victory to try to stay in the top 5. Again Finkler named on the bench. Troisi scored a goal and was subbed for Finkler after just under an hour, and Finkler laid up Mitch Nichols with a sublime pass to put Victory 3-0 up against the 10-man Heart, and gift Nichols his first, and last brace at Melbourne Victory - days later J-League club Cerezo Osaka managed by Australian Ranko Popovic increased its offer for Nichols to $325k from $200k. Victory eventually sold him at the 3rd bid, on 6/1/2014, for AUD$400k - double the initial offer, and with a clause that would benefit Victory financially if Cerezo re-sold him. This and Finkler's improvement after returning from injury led to more time on the pitch and a regular starting XI place.

At the opening ceremony, Provost Christie refuted criticism of the location by pointing out that ‘five or ten minutes walk would bring any one to the Institute from the most distant part of the Burgh’ and that the site was chosen on environmental grounds ‘free from the noise and bustle and free from the dirt, dust and smoke, so that the students of art, science and literature could pursue their studies there unmolested and free from annoyance’. It was perhaps thanks to Provost Christie that the organisation came into being at all, for Thomas Stuart Smith’s first thoughts were to leave his money to the Artists’ Benevolent Association.

HICEM's European headquarters were based in Paris. After Germany invaded and conquered France in mid-1940, HICEM closed its Paris offices, moving to Marseille in the so-called “free zone” Vichy France, and to Lisbon, Portugal. Until November 11, 1942, when the Germans occupied all of France, HICEM employees were at work in French internment camps, such as the infamous Gurs. HIAS looked for Jews who met U.S. State Department immigration requirements, and were ready to leave France. At the time of the German invasion of France, there were approximately 300,000 native and foreign Jews living in France; however, the State Department’s policies curbing immigration meant that the number of applicants to America far exceeded the number allowed to leave.
In its poorest offensive performance of the season, Ohio State struggled against 2–7 Illinois but escaped with a 17–10 win. Illinois drove 80 yards in the last five minutes of the game to close the margin to a touchdown, but Ohio State recovered the onside kick and managed to hold the ball until only 4 seconds were left in the game. Their punt pinned Illinois at the Illini three and the game ended on the next play.

Allan was shown as a clever business minded person who used to come up with some nasty and immoral tricks to earn fast money and used to use Nannha as his stooge. He was not himself inclined to work and would rather used to be the sleeping partner in every saga or telling the tricks to poor Nannha (his Front man). The character of Nannha became an instant hit. He was shown as an innocent, funny and somewhat dumb looking person from a rural area who loved his country and would dream of living an honest livelihood. He didn't know the norms of the new society and was therefore used by Allan as the front man for his tricks. In the end, he would unintentionally toss out the whole plot of Allan by speaking the truth to the public.This PTV series was first aired in 1971-72, and second time in early 1980's.
The city of Pithole derived its name from its proximity to Pithole Creek, which flows through Venango County to the Allegheny River. The origin of the name "Pithole" itself, however, is a mystery. One origination theory is that early pioneers stumbled across strange fissures from which sulfurous fumes wafted. Such "pit-holes" are found in the area where Pithole Creek empties into the Allegheny River, with some measuring wide and long. Another possible explanation involves the discovery of ancient pits dug by early settlers, some wide and deep, that were cribbed with oil-soaked timbers. These "pit-holes", found along Oil Creek and in Cornplanter Township, supposedly predate the Senecas who inhabited the area from the mid-17th to the late 18th century.

peristalsis, involuntary movements of the longitudinal and circular muscles, primarily in the digestive tract but occasionally in other hollow tubes of the body, that occur in progressive wavelike contractions. Peristaltic waves occur in the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The waves can be short, local reflexes or long, continuous contractions that travel the whole length of the organ, depending upon their location and what initiates their action.

The "Flywheel" was founded by Tom Swallow, and comprised pages from school exercise-books that carried hand-written articles with colour illustrations from whatever inks the editorial team could produce from stolen materials, like quinine from the medical room; these were stuck into place with fermented millet soup, kept from the meagre camp rations. One copy per issue was produced, to be circulated among members throughout the camp. When extracts were published in hardback format in 1987, the book ran to two reprints.

Another American critic of the War on Terror, Paul Craig Roberts, wrote that al-Awlaki gave "sermons critical of Washington’s indiscriminate assaults on Muslim peoples" who "told Muslims that they did not have to passively accept American aggression". He called the operation "The Day America Died" as he asserted that the US lacked evidence that either al-Awlaki or Khan were real threats or al-Qaeda operatives.
