A Company of Swans is a historical romance novel published in 1985 by Eva Ibbotson. The book is dedicated to Patricia Veryan. Critically well received, the young adult novel is starting to be obliquely referred to in reviews, as reviewers attempt to compliment a new work by comparing it to another, better established work.

In the process of developing the area, it was decided to sever the rural parts north of Somerton Road from the Shire, and in 1955, parts of the Shire of Broadmeadows were severed and annexed to the Shires of Bulla, Whittlesea and Kilmore.

In 2007 Conway Morris and Caron described a new fossil, "Orthrozanclus", which had a mineralized shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of "Wiwaxia" – and, like both of these, a soft underside which they interpreted as a muscular foot, and a similar arrangement of the sclerites into three concentric bands. Some of "Orthrozanclus"’s sclerites appear to have been hollow, as the specimen includes what look like internal castings. They took these features as evidence that the halkieriids, "Wiwaxia" and "Orthrozanclus" were very closely related and formed the group "halwaxiids". However the simplest "family tree" faces an obstacle: the siphogonuchitids appear in earlier rocks and had "mineralized" sclerites. Hence Conway Morris and Caron found it necessary to consider two more complex family trees, concluding that "Hypothesis 1" fitted the available data better, but was sensitive to minor changes in the characteristics used:
