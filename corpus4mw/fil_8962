Melahat Senger-Ruacan (1906 Istanbul–1974) was a female Turkish high court judge and the first child of Colonel Nuri and Güzide hanım. She attended high school at Erenköy Girls High School (Erenköy Kız Lisesi), an exclusive lycée in Istanbul and later studied Philosophy at The University of Istanbul. Following Kemal Atatürk’s establishment of Ankara as the new capital of the Turkish Republic, a new university was organized in this city. Melahat Senger moved to the new capital to attend Law School (Ankara Üniversitesi Hukuk Fakültesi) from 1925–1929 and finished her studies as the first female graduate of this new school with high honors. In 1938 she married Asım Ruacan, a colleague in law, and had one son with him.
