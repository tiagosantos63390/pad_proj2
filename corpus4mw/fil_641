When one function calls another during a typical program's execution, the local state of the caller (including parameters and local variables) must be preserved in order for execution to proceed after the callee returns. In most compiled programs, this local state is stored on the call stack in a data structure called an activation record or "stack frame". This stack frame is pushed, or allocated, as prelude to calling another function, and is popped, or deallocated, when the other function returns to the function that did the call. The upwards funarg problem arises when the calling function refers to the called/exited function's state after that function has returned. Therefore, the activation record containing the called function's state variables must not be deallocated when the function returns, violating the stack-based function call paradigm.

Nevertheless, Griffin unseated third district incumbent Carl Wick on November 5 to return to the State Board of Education. Immediately after the election, party leaders in Dayton vowed they would try to remove him from office and the "Daily News" ran more scathing opinions – one writer called him a "rat" – but Griffin served on the board until his death. "I am so disillusioned with our electorate," Lieberman said after Griffin's election.
