The Wharton K-8 Dual Language philosophy promotes both Spanish and English as languages of equal value. By placing importance on both languages students are not only preparing for the multilingual, multicultural world they live in, but they are also learning the importance and value in respecting other cultures in an increasingly global society. The Wharton K-8 Dual Language Program is a school-wide program beginning in Kindergarten and going on through 8th Grade. Beginning in Kindergarten, 90% of instruction is in Spanish while 10% of the instruction is in English. It is through this concept of "total immersion" in Spanish that children first begin to acquire the foundation that will anchor their progress as they start their journey towards being bilingual and bi-literate students. In 1st grade, 80% of the instruction is given in Spanish and 20% in English. In 2nd grade, 70% of the instruction is in Spanish and 30% in English. This pattern continues until the 4th grade where it then becomes and stays 50% in Spanish and 50% in English. Much research has been done in the area of Dual Language programs and it shows that once children have become fully bilingual, they start to outperform their peers academically as they progress through middle school, high school, and beyond. It is during the formative years of brain development when students are learning two languages that the foundation is laid for future success.
