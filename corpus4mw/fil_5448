Boaters can float the Chatanika River in many kinds of non-motorized watercraft. The Elliott Highway, which crosses the river below the village of Chatanika, and the Steese Highway, which parallels the river further upstream, offer multiple places to begin and end boating trips. Several public campgrounds and waysides along these highways afford access to the river. The entire river is rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Dangers include logjams and overhanging trees and stumps.
The Jonathan Buck House (571 Woburn Street, c. 1795-1820) is an excellent local example of Federal architecture, and one of only a few period hip roofed houses in the town. It is the typical five bays wide and two deep, with a central doorway flanked by full-length sidelight windows and pilasters supporting a narrow entablature. The remaining contributing houses to the district were built later in the 19th century: the Henry Sheldon House (603 Woburn Street, c. 1861-62) is Italianate in style, and the John Howard Eames House (590 Woburn Street, c. 1883) is a Queen Anne Victorian. Three houses have 19th century barns that contribute to the district (as did the Ephraim Buck House until its barn was demolished).
