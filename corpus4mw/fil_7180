Ally Darling (Anna Faris) is a thirty-something woman who is struggling to make better decisions with her life. Her boyfriend Rick (Zachary Quinto) breaks up with her when she asks him to attend her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) upcoming wedding, and she then gets laid off from her job. While taking the subway home, Ally comes across a "Marie Claire" magazine article entitled "What's Your Number?", which says that women who have more than twenty lovers in their lifetime have difficulty finding a husband. After making a list of all the men she slept with, she realizes that her number is nineteen, making her decide not to have sex with anyone else until she finds "the one". She then wakes up after Daisy's bachelorette party and discovers that she hooked up with her ex-boss Roger (Joel McHale). Hoping to miss an awkward confrontation, Ally lets her neighbor Colin Shea (Chris Evans) into her apartment so that way Roger will leave. It turns out that Colin was only over to avoid a girl that he slept with, because he doesn't want to give the women he sees any expectations. Ally then runs into "Disgusting Donald" (Chris Pratt), her once overweight ex-boyfriend who's now successful and good-looking. She decides to track down all of her ex-boyfriends in the hope that one of them will have grown into the man she wants to marry, and therefore the number of men she has slept with will never have to increase. She gets help from Colin in exchange for letting him stay in her place after his one-night stands, but things do not quite work out the way she had expected and Ally remembers why it didn't work out with those men in the first place. After a falling out with Colin, Ally thinks she finally finds her match - an old flame, Jake Adams (Dave Annable). She attends her sister's wedding with Jake only to realize that the man she truly loves is Colin. Ally runs across the city to find Colin and the two reunite with a kiss. Afterwards, Ally gets a call from an old boyfriend (Aziz Ansari) telling her that they in fact did not sleep together. Ally rejoices in the fact that Colin is indeed the 20th and last man she ever slept with.

Psalm 142
The “hardships” endured by David may have been the long struggle with King Saul’s forces, or the difficulties David encountered in bringing the ark to Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:6-15; 1 Chr 15:5-14). According to legendary traditions, which contain elements of historical truth, the king made a vow to the Lord that he would select a place of “rest” for “the Mighty One of Jacob.” This designation of Yahweh, literally “the Bull,” seems to reflect, with other words, a northern origin of the psalm (cf. v. 5; also Pss 24:6; 44:4; 46:7, 11; 49:13; Isa 49:26; 50:16).

Twenty years later the Soviet Navy issued a requirement for a ship capable of dealing with enemy cruisers, but the design began to grow as it was modified to allow for combat with German pocket battleships on even terms, and later modified to gain parity with the s. Two ships were laid down in 1939, but development of their new guns lagged significantly behind their construction and six twin-gun turrets were ordered from Germany in 1940. The working drawings for the turrets and guns had not even been received when Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941. The incomplete hulls of both ships were ordered scrapped in 1947.

Electro swing is a musical genre combining the influence of (most commonly) vintage swing with contemporary production techniques or styles - the 'electro' part of the name. This might include house, hip hop, EDM or other predominantly computer-produced music but might also encompass anything contemporary such as scratching with an otherwise all-live band. The genre often incorporates loops, samples or melodies that deliberately reference a sound-pallet (to the inclusion therefore of the dance moves and fashions) from the classic swing, jazz and big band era. Typically this is the period from the mid 1920s to the late 1940s and would include music by Duke Ellington, Django Reinhardt, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman among many others. Successful examples of the genre create a modern and dance-floor focussed sound that is more readily accessible to the modern ear but that also retains the feeling of live brass and the energetic excitement of the early swing recordings. The best-known artists include Parov Stelar and Caravan Palace while one-off international hits include 'Why Don't You Do Right?' by Gramophonedzie or 'We No Speak Americano' by Yolanda Be Cool Vs DCUP.
