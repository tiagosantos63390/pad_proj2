The first Donatary of Vidigueira and castle was Mestre Tomé, tresurer of the Sé Cathedral of Braga during the reign of Afonso III of Portugal, making the construction of the castle part of the repopulation strategy of the 13th century. Mestre Tomé, sometime supplier for the old Matriz church of the settlement, erected and reinforced the castle as a bastion of the defense line of the Guadiana, an important line between Portugal and Castile. A few decades later, at the beginning of the 14th century, King Denis recovered the village of Vidigueira for the Crown of Portugal. In 1385 King John I offered Vidigueira to his constable, Nuno Álvares Pereira. Through his daughter's (D. Beatriz Pereira Alvim) marriage, with D. Afonso, Count of Barcelos and first Duke of Braganza, the castle and courtyard in Vidigueira passed into the possession of the House of Braganza, one of the more opulent in the kingdom.
