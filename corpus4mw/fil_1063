Thomas M. Disch praised "White Light" as "a good, intelligent, powerful novel," describing it as "a sort of cross between Raymond Chandler and Lewis Carroll (another mathematicizing fabulist) with a tip of the hat along the way to Franz Kafka."
In 1782 was born Giambattista Niccolini. In literature he was a classicist; in politics he was a Ghibelline, a rare exception in Guelph Florence, his birthplace. In imitating Aeschylus, as well as in writing the "Discorsi sulla tragedia greca", and on the "Sublime Michelangelo", Niccolini displayed his passionate devotion to ancient literature. In his tragedies he set himself free from the excessive rigidity of Alfieri, and partly approached the English and German tragic authors. He nearly always chose political subjects, striving to keep alive in his compatriots the love of liberty. Such are "Nabucco", "Antonio Foscarini", "Giovanni da Procida", "Lodovico il Moro" and others. He assailed papal Rome in "Arnaldo da Brescia", a long tragic piece, not suited for acting, and epic rather than dramatic. Niccolini's tragedies show a rich lyric vein rather than dramatic genius. He has the merit of having vindicated liberal ideas, and of having opened a new path to Italian tragedy.
is a parabolic element. Note that all parabolic elements of SL(2,C) are conjugate to this element. That is, if "g" ∈ SL(2,Z) is parabolic, then formula_2 for some "h" ∈ SL(2,Z). 
The NFL playoffs following the 1993 NFL season led up to Super Bowl XXVIII. Since the 1993 regular season was conducted over 18 weeks (two byes per team), the traditional bye week between the conference championship games and Super Bowl was removed.
Houston was then forced to punt for the first time in the game on their next drive, and Greg Montgomery's 25-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at their own 41-yard line. Reich started out the ensuing drive with an 18-yard completion to James Lofton. Davis gained 20 yards on a screen pass and then Reich threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, trimming the lead to 35–24. Then on the first play of the Oilers' ensuing possession, Moon's pass was tipped off the hands of Slaughter; Bills' safety Henry Jones intercepted the pass from Moon and returned it 15 yards to the Houston 23-yard line. Three plays later, Buffalo faced fourth down and five on the 18-yard line. Rather than attempt a field goal, Reich connected with Reed for the touchdown. With the score (including the extra point), the Bills had cut their deficit from 32 points to four in a span of just 6:52. On the Oilers' next drive, linebacker Darryl Talley forced a fumble from Moon while sacking him. Houston recovered the fumble, but they were forced to punt, and Montgomery's 24-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at its 48-yard line.

As an example, with traditional programming the main function of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available commands and query the user to select one. The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in text based interfaces. For example, an email client may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command.

There is also a proposal to connect Honnavar and Talguppa in Shimoga district by a new railway line, which will be a shorter alternate rail route between Mumbai and southern India. In Railway Budget 2010-11, Indian Railway Ministry suggested Public–private partnership (PPP) model to take up this project as the Government of India cannot fund this project alone due to concerns about Rate of return and the complex nature of the project.
