NeuN was first described in 1992 by Mullen et al., who raised a series of monoclonal antibodies to mouse antigens with the original intent of finding mouse species specific immunological markers for use in transplantation experiments. In the event they isolated a hybridoma line, called mAb A60, which proved to bind an antigen expressed only in neuronal nuclei and to a lesser extent the cytoplasm of neuronal cells, and which appeared to work on all vertebrates. This unknown antigen was therefore known as NeuN for "Neuronal Nuclei". In 2009, Kim et al. used proteomic methods to show that NeuN corresponds to a protein known as Rbfox3.

After 90 minutes of normal time and 30 minutes of extra time the score was 0–0 so the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out; the first Scottish Challenge Cup final to be decided this way.

Both clubs scored each of their next penalties which meant Stenhousemuir won 5–4. The result was notable in that Dundee United progressed through every round of tournament without conceding a single goal and still lost the final.
