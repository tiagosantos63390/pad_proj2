The minesweeper operated out of that port until 30 June 1965. During these years, the ship conducted local operations, conducted experiments with new equipment, evaluated new type mines, and provided services for the missile testing facility at Cape Canaveral. In November 1963, her evaluation testing was interrupted when she was deployed to locate and assist in the salvage of a downed U-2 aircraft in Florida Bay.
Royal was born in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond. He graduated from Footscray Technical College (now part of Victoria University) with a Diploma in Applied Chemistry in 1958. After graduating, he worked as the Australian Patent, Trade Mark and Designs Office in Canberra, Australia as an Examiner of Patents. Malcolm loved education. While still at the Patent Office, he became a Training Office in Patent Law. In 1964, he left the Patent Office and joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to work in their Patent Licensing Section. His role there was to assist in the commercialisation of inventions developed by scientists and engineers, many of them of world prominence, who worked with or for CSIRO.

Design of this machine was by SAF-Avions Dewoitine but owing to over work at that companies plant at the time, manufacture of the D.372 was transferred to Lioré et Olivier. They were high-wing monoplanes of all-metal construction with valve head blisters on their engine cowlings. The first prototype flew in October 1931. Flight testing resulted in the need for multiple revisions in both engine and airframe, so it was February 1934 before the second prototype flew. Its performance prompted the French government to order for 28 for the "Armée de l'Air" and "Aéronavale". The Lithuanian government ordered 14 that remained in service with their tiny Air Force until 1936, when they were sold to the Spanish Republican government.

Angham's first single music video from "Bahibbik Wahashteeny" record is the title song itself. It was directed by Hady elBajoury. The director was searching for something simple for this particular music video, content only to show Angham in daily life activities in her true face and colours. The filming took part in alGouna, a tourist site in the south of Egypt. In this music video, Angham is considered the first Arabic female artist to appear in her seventh-month pregnant state. She herself wanted a music video that does not exhaust her too much, but yet remain creative, warm and friendly to the lyric of the song. Fahd created a shorter version of the song for the music video where he have cut short the instrumental music as it shows between the 3:10 and 3:35 minutes sequences. Angham won "best presence and allure" and "best camera expression" for this music video, according to Rotana Top 20.

It tackles a very simple scenario, featuring Angham wandering with a car driver through the streets of Lebanon in order to arrive at a private little concert. She wore her hair very short to make the public think of her hit song "Sidi Wisalak" (Your Charm) from her 2001 record. The second music video was a favor. It helped boost the record's sale, however, in a moderate way.

Thus, the Fathers of the Church have recommended this practice. St. John Chrysostom once explained that "when a person has eaten some delicious food at a banquet, he is careful not to take anything bitter in his mouth immediately after, lest he should lose the sweet flavour of those delicate viands. In like manner, when we have received the precious Body of Jesus Christ, we should take care not to lose its heavenly flavour by turning too soon to the cares and business of the world."

The singing club was founded in 1897. The "Spielvereinigung" (“playing league”) came into being in 1946 and supports several football teams through lively youth work. A gymnastic club, which was founded after the First World War, can be seen as this club’s forerunner. Likewise in the 1920s, a shooting club was founded. The "Landfrauenverein" (“countrywomen’s club”), founded in 1975, too, had a forerunner in the farm housewives’ club, founded in 1898. Also founded in 1975 was the "Pfälzerwaldverein" (“Palatinate Forest Club”), a hiking club. It maintains a cabin in the Buchwald (forest), the "Buchwaldhütte". The newly founded "Förderverein Pfalz-Veldenz" (“Palatinate-Veldenz Promotional Club”) has its seat in Theisbergstegen.

By contrast, Le Verrier was arrogant and assertive, enabling the British scientific establishment to close ranks behind Adams while the French, in general, found little sympathy with Le Verrier. In 1874–1876, Adams was president of the Royal Astronomical Society when it fell to him to present the gold medal of the year to Le Verrier.
