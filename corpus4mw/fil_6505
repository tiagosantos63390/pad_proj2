Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, devotes the whole tenth chapter of Hilkot Teshubah, with reference to Abot i. 3, to love of God as the motive which gives all human action its true ethical and religious value. Maimonides wrote that it should only be out of love for God, rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward, that Jews should obey the law: "When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love". Maimonides thinks that love of God can be developed by contemplating Divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature (Maimonides, "Mishneh Torah", Hilchot Yesoday HaTorah, Chapter 2).

The central character is a Siberian native, who has been prisoner in a Gulag and who speaks a language that has almost disappeared, one that keeps the last vestige of a vanished sound, the lateral fricative with labiovelar appendix. A Russian student comes to understand him and wants to show him to a congress on Uralic languages in Helsinki. However, a purist Finnish professor attempts to prevent the innocent Siberian appearance there as a living proof of the philological connection between the Finnish language and the American natives. The plot includes a Lapon pimp, country cottages with saunas, vacation boats in the Baltic Sea, and sometimes the narration takes a rowdy tone with reminiscences of "Wilt" by Tom Sharpe.

The era from the mid-1890s to the World War I has been described as Australian cricket's golden age. This era saw the emergence of players such as Monty Noble, Clem Hill and in particular Victor Trumper, who was idolised by the Australian public. It also saw the continuing battle between the Melbourne Cricket Club and the players on one side with the state boards and the new Australian Board of Control on the other. The dispute was over the organisation of international tours and the revenue streams it created. It culminated in 1912 with the withdrawal of six leading players; Trumper, Hill, Warwick Armstrong, Vernon Ransford, Albert Cotter and Hanson "Sammy" Carter from the tri-nations series in England that year and a fistfight between Hill and his fellow selector Peter McAlister. The tour was unsuccessful and dogged by controversy.

It was one of six aircraft based on the Siemens-Schuckert R.I that were originally intended to be identical, but which each developed in a different direction and were designated as different aircraft types by the German Inspectorate of Flying Troops (the Idflieg). Although the R.II was the first of the batch to be completed, it was the last accepted into military service, and then only as a trainer.

In 2001, Kihara's T-shirt series "Teuanoa‛i – Adorn to Excess" which parodied well-known corporate logos were exhibited at Te Papa and later added to the national museum's collection. The T-shirts featured Kihara's quirky take on well-known brands, turning logos such as The Warehouse to "The Whorehouse" and KFC to "KKK". The exhibition created controversy in the media and raised legal questions about copyright versus artistic expression. Following legal advice, Te Papa removed three of the 28 T-shirts from its exhibition, but purchased the entire series.

"Borophagus dudleyi" was originally named "Pliogulo dudleyi" by T.E. White in 1941. "Borophagus dudleyi", like other "Borophaginae", are loosely known as "bone-crushing" or "hyena-like" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as "Epicyon", which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, "Borophagus" began being displaced by "Canis" genera such as "Canis edwardii" and later by "Canis dirus". Early species of "Borophagus" were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. "Borophagus parvus" possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals.
