A "Hamiltonian path" or "traceable path" is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A graph is Hamiltonian-connected if for every pair of vertices there is a Hamiltonian path between the two vertices.

Another possible scenario has Sun Ce living for quite some time. The physician told Sun Ce to rest still for a hundred days to allow the wound to heal, but Sun Ce looked into the mirror one day and, seeing his scar, became so enraged that he slammed his table. The large movement caused the wound to break and he died in the same night. Although he was survived by one son, Sun Ce passed his legacy to his younger brother Sun Quan. When Sun Quan declared himself the first emperor of the state of Eastern Wu in 222, he bestowed upon Sun Ce the posthumous title of Prince Huan of Changsha (長沙桓王).
Beatrice Tanner made her professional stage debut in 1888 at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, four years after her marriage to Patrick Campbell. In March 1890, she appeared in London at the Adelphi, where she afterward played again in 1891–93. She became successful after starring in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's play, "The Second Mrs Tanqueray", in 1893, at St. James's Theatre where she also appeared in 1894 in "The Masqueraders". As Kate Cloud in "John-a-Dreams", produced by Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1894, she had another success, and again as Agnes in "The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith" at the Garrick (1895). 
To join the Camarilla, the Malkavian "attenuated" the powers that caused madness. In a meeting that attracted powerful ancients and Methuselah of the clan, held in Domalize in 1497, they "closed" in part their minds, except for a minority that resisted the transformation and become the Malkavian Antitribu of the Sabbat.

When Peng Yang (彭羕) was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Jiangyang (江陽; in present-day Luzhou, Sichuan) and was about to leave Chengdu to assume office, he visited Ma Chao and said, "You're in charge of external affairs while I'm in charge of internal affairs. We can pacify the Empire." Ma Chao had recently joined Liu Bei's forces and he was often fearful that he would get into trouble. When he heard Peng Yang's speech, he was shocked and did not reply. After Peng Yang left, Ma Chao reported Peng's speech, which resulted in Peng's arrest and imprisonment. Peng Yang was later executed.

In mathematics the one-sided limit "x"→"a"+ means "x" approaches "a" from the right, and "x"→"a"− means "x" approaches "a" from the left. For example, when calculating what "x"−1 is when "x" approaches 0, because "x"−1→+∞ when "x"→0+ but "x"−1→−∞ when "x"→0−.

The regularized incomplete beta function is the cumulative distribution function of the Beta distribution, and is related to the cumulative distribution function of a random variable "X" from a binomial distribution, where the "probability of success" is "p" and the sample size is "n":
The air/fuel mixture is ignited by two 14 mm spark plugs per cylinder. These plugs are fired by two 44-ampere magnetos. Normal ignition timing is 58-65 degrees BTDC. (This is dramatically greater spark advance than in a petrol engine as "nitro" and alcohol burn far slower.) Directly after launch the timing is typically decreased by about 25 degrees for a short time as this gives the tires time to reach their correct shape. The ignition system limits the engine speed to 8400 rpm. The ignition system provides initial 50,000 volts and 1.2 amperes. The long duration spark (up to 26 degrees) provides energy of 950 millijoules. The plugs are placed in such a way that they are cooled by the incoming charge. The ignition system is not allowed to respond to real time information (no computer-based spark lead adjustments), so instead a timer-based retard system is used.
In the Ashby-and-Cybernetics tradition, the word "trial" usually implies "random-or-arbitrary", without any "deliberate" choice.

The bulk of the energy that fume hoods are responsible for is the energy needed to heat and/or cool air delivered to the lab space. Depending on the type of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system installed, this energy can be electricity, natural gas, heating oil, coal, or other energy types. Additional electricity is consumed by fans in the HVAC system and fans in the fume hood exhaust system.
