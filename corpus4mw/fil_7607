Feeding Fingers fourth album, 'The Occupant', was released in late February 2013. Because of Justin Curfman's relocation to Germany the album had a number of producers. On this release Coyote J co-produced only three tracks: 'Inside The Body Of An Animal', 'I Drink Disappearing Ink' and 'Paper Dolls Would Eat Glass For Us,' as well as providing financial support.
In his role for "Ocean Heaven" playing the autistic character of 'Dafu', he acted extremely realistically which saw many people believing the actor to in fact be autistic. He is seen continually swimming with ease and playing with dolphins in the aquarium which have become some popular aspects of the film.
