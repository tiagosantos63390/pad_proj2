's persona has been portrayed through her no nonsense business minded ways. Chambers has described Rosemary as having a business woman's "take-no-prisoners" attitude. Chambers also stated during an interview in 2003, the reasons why she believed Rosemary was popular with viewers, stating: "I think some of her popularity is due to the fact that she could be relied upon to stir things up; that she was not wishy washy and that she stood her ground with men the same way she did with women." Also adding that Rosemary worked better as a recurring character because of her personality. Chambers has also claimed Rosemary's hidden softer side was shown whilst adopting Tracey Dawson, helping her mother Anne and to the rest of her family. Of why her character was portrayed in this way, Chambers has said: "Reg Watson came up with the Rosemary Daniels character as an alternative to many women in the street who were mothers or young women growing up and feeling their way. So yes she symbolised the strength of the female in the Neighbours' saga. Perhaps you could say that Rosemary was there as a point of reference for the emancipated female. Yet mums and married women in the viewing audience related to her too because Rosemary did fall in love a few times. She would have married but the relationships always ended sadly and so she never did. I think Rosemary realised she was in truth, 'married' to her work: it gave her great joy."
