Historic forestry-based industry.
Agua Caliente originated as a land grant long on the east side of Sonoma Creek. George and Emma Fetters opened the Fetters Hot Springs resort in 1908. The two communities are generally thought of as separate from one another, though they are adjacent. Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente is immediately north of Boyes Hot Springs and El Verano. Over time, the boundaries between these four communities became blurred and they are often grouped together and referred to collectively as "the Springs" area of Sonoma Valley. 
Before the arrival of Europeans and Russians, the wide valley containing Santa Rosa was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the valley closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by smallpox brought unintentionally from Europe, and by the eradication efforts of Anglo settlers. By 1900 the Pomos had been reduced by 95%.
