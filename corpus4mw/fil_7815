Preconsolidation pressure cannot be measured directly. It can be estimated using a number of different strategies. Samples taken from the field are subjected to a variety of tests, like the constrant rate of strain test (CRS) or the incremental loading test (IL). These test can be costly due to expensive equipment and the long period of time required for each test. Each sample must be undisturbed and can only undergo one test with satisfactory results. It is important to execute these tests precisely to ensure an accurate resulting plot. There are various methods for determining the preconsolidation pressure from lab data. The data is usually arranged on a semilog plot of the effective stress (frequently represented as σ'vc) verses the void ratio. This graph is commonly called the e log p curve or the consolidation curve.
