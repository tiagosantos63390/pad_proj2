All LX700-based models can natively boot using Coreboot. This started as a Geode GX port developed by AMD for the OLPC prototype, to which Artec added Geode LX support. That code was later adopted and further polished by AMD, after the OLPC switched to the LX700 for its production models. This Coreboot port was used on the SmartLink model and on several custom Artec models configured as network appliances.

A census of Knoxville's churches taken on January 31, 1925, indicated how large and diversified the city was becoming. An 1868 survey had found thirteen congregations in the city: four Presbyterian (three white, one black), three Methodist (two white, one black), two Baptist (one white, one black), two Episcopalian, one Roman Catholic and one Jewish. At that time the city's population was just over 8,000.

Royce Axelrod was a student at Dakota Union High School, but was in fact nothing more than a thug; Royce is an aggressive juvenile delinquent and an impulsive thief with a history of stealing prior to the events of the episode "Pop's Girlfriend". His 'best friend' (the term is used loosely) was Frankie, his shadow, lap-dog, doormat, flunky, and 'Yes-Man' for most of the episode. It was hinted in the episode that he may have had some prior association with F-Stop. Although not a Bang-Baby originally, Royce's exposure to vapors of a stolen sample of concentrated Big Bang liquid turns him into a large, misshapen humanoid Bang Baby, with light pink skin and reduces his mind to a primitive caveman-like mentality. Royce's only appearance was in the episode "Pop's Girlfriend".
