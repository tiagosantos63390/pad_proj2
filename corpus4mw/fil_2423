The university earned Level IV re-accreditation from the Federation of Accrediting Association of the Philippines for the degree programs of its Colleges of Business Administration, Education, Liberal Arts, Nursing and Science after the formal survey conducted by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). It was also named as a Center of Development for Excellence in Information Technology. It was also identified as an Academic Center For Excellence in Biodiversity Conservation by Haribon Foundation in the Southern Tagalog Faunal Region. It was declared as Center of Training Institution (COT) by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and Department of Education.

After a revolt in 1926 in the Dutch East Indies, a concentration camp for political prisoners was set up in what then was called Netherlands New Guinea, in the very remote and unhealthy jungle at Boven-Digoel (Upper-Digul).

William Neville "Bill" Scott OAM (4 October 1923 – 22 December 2005) was an Australian author, folklorist, songwriter, poet and a collector of bush ballads and Australian folk history. He has published anthologies of Australian bush songs, including the best selling book "The Complete Book of Australian Folklore" published in 1976. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1992 for his contributions to folklore, folk music and Australian literature. He was considered a living treasure and his anthologies of songs and his donated collections continue his legacy.

Dictionaries define genetic polymorphism as the presence, in appreciable frequencies, of two or more alleles at a locus in a species. Hence "H2" polymorphism was expected to have arisen by an unusually high mutation (evolutionary) rate in the house mouse after its divergence from its nearest relative. There was, however no indication that this was the case. On the contrary, Klein and his co-workers found, by the methods then available, indistinguishable alleles in the two European house mouse species, "Mus domesticus" and "M. musculus", which diverged from each other some 1–2 million years (my) ago. Similarly, in "M. domesticus" populations, whose divergence times could be dated, they found no new variants. Klein’s group could also not find any new "Mhc" (HLA) variants in isolated human populations such as those of the South American Indians and the indigenous populations of Siberia. These and other observations led Klein to the formulation of the "trans-species polymorphism (TSP) hypothesis" positing that the divergence of similar "Mhc" alleles predates the divergence of the species in which they occur. The original detection of trans-species polymorphism relied on serological (antibody-based) identification of antigenic molecules. Later, however, the identity of alleles in different species could be confirmed by peptide-mapping analysis of the antigenic proteins. Ultimately, DNA-sequencing not only confirmed the results obtained with the earlier methods, but also introduced a new dimension into the TSP studies. The tests revealed that closely related species such as "M. domesticus" and "M. musculus", the many haplochromine fish species in East African lakes and rivers, or Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos Islands, shared many alleles at not only the "Mhc", but also at some of the non-"Mhc" loci. In more distantly related species, such as human and chimpanzee or the house mouse and the Norwegian rat, sharing of identical alleles could no longer be demonstrated, but shared related alleles were clearly in evidence. This finding led to the concept of "allelic lineages", in which members of a given lineage in one species were more similar to members of the same linage in another species than they were to other alleles in either of the two species, TSP of "Mhc" and other loci has since been documented in many species and found applications to a variety of issues in evolutionary biology.
As the highest-ranked Public Prosecutor of Turkey, Yalçınkaya brought charges against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) on 14 March 2008 to the Constitutional Court of Turkey, charging the party for violating the principle of separation of religion and state in Turkey and requesting that the party be closed and its 71 officials barred from politics for five years. Those officials include the current president Abdullah Gül and the prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The court confirmed that the party had beecome "a center for anti-secular activities", but decided not to close the party, imposing a financial penalty as a warning instead by cutting 50% of the state funding to the party.

Bruges-la-Morte (French; The Dead of Bruges) is a short novel by the Belgian author Georges Rodenbach, first published in 1892. The novel is notable for two reasons, it was the archetypal Symbolist novel, and was the first work of fiction illustrated with photographs.
