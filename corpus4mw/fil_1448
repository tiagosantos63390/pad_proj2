In April 2012, his illness progressed to the point where his liver and his kidneys shut down. He was put on the list waiting for a liver transplant. Friends organized a campaign to collect donations to support MacDonald and to help cover his medical expenses. On March 15, 2013 MacDonald underwent a successful seven-hour liver transplant operation.

Garrett played in the first Test match, against Lillywhite’s team in Melbourne in March 1877. At 18 years and 232 days is still the youngest representative to play for Australia against England. In that match he scored 18 not out in the first innings, and helped sustain a crucial 43-run partnership with Charles Bannerman until the latter split his finger and retired hurt on 165. Promoted to number four in the second innings, Garrett made a duck (zero runs). Opening the bowling with John Hodges he took two wickets in the first innings (including that of top scorer, Henry Jupp). In 1878, he toured England and North America with the first representative Australian team to go overseas. He toured England again in 1882, participating in an historic Ashes match at The Oval. His last match was at Sydney in 1888.
