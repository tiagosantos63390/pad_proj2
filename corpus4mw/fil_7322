The Maple Leafs attempted to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2003–04 season. They were officially eliminated from playoff contention on April 5, 2011, when Buffalo Sabres beat Tampa Bay Lightning 4–2, shortly before Toronto lost to the Washington Capitals in a shoot-out. They continue to hold the second longest playoff-drought streak, second only to the Florida Panthers. Neither team have reached the playoffs since the NHL lockout. The Leafs hold the longest active Stanley Cup Finals drought streak not having competed in the finals since the 1966–67 NHL season. They also are tied with the Los Angeles Kings and the St. Louis Blues for the longest drought without a Stanley Cup until the Kings won the Stanley Cup in 2012. In the 2009–10 NHL season, the Chicago Blackhawks ended the longest drought without winning a Stanley Cup at that time, not having won the Stanley Cup since the 1960–61 NHL season.


In 1657 Stapley, abandoned the political views of his father and became entangled in a plot for the return of Charles II. At the house of his grandmother, Lady Champion, he had come under the influence of Dr. John Hewett and Lord Mordaunt. Ostensibly with a view to "the expiation of his father's crime", he professed himself anxious to "venture his life and his fortune for his majesty's restoration". In June 1657, through the instrumentality of Hewett, he had received from the exiled king a commission for the raising of a troop of horse and six colonels' commissions, to be distributed at his discretion. His interest in the county was considered to be great, and his promises of support to the royalist party were confident. Doubts were, however, thrown upon his ability to carry out all his plans. Through the treachery of a subordinate he fell into the hands of Cromwell in the spring of 1658, when he disclosed such particulars of the plot as led to the arrest of Hewett, Mordaunt, and Sir Henry Slingsby. Cromwell, however, dismissed him with a reproof, presumably on account of his friendship with his father. Stapley appeared as a witness against Mordaunt at his trial on 2 July 1658, but, according to Clarendon, answered "in so disorderly and confused a manner that it appeared that he had much rather not have said it". His younger brother Anthony was also concerned in the plot, and made full disclosures when examined by Colonel William Goffe and Henry Scobell in April 1658.

Deb wanted to tell Grayson who she actually was, but was devastated when he fell for fellow lawyer Kim Kaswell. Deb would later come to accept what had happen and told Grayson that she saw no problem about the two kissing, although Kim had decided already to tell Grayson that she did not want to start a relationship with him. She also was the one who warned her guardian angel Fred about falling for her best friend Stacy that would lead to memories of his existence being erased. When Jane's mother came to town to visit, Deb did her best to handle it, realizing the distance the mother and daughter had and deciding that if she couldn't be with her own mother again, she could at least have Jane's. Sparks also seem to fly between Jane and another lawyer, Tony as they embark on a relationship.

Matt Bjorke of "Roughstock" described the song positively in his review of the album, saying that it had a similar rock influence to the work of Jason Aldean but was comparably more authentic. Bobby Peacock of "Roughstock" gave the song three and a half stars out of five, writing that Moore "has a down-home, everyman twang to his voice, lending the right amount of authenticity to his country-boy anthems" and that "the melody and production are a pleasing throwback to the early-mid 1990s."
