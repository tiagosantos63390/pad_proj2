Various clinical studies have shown that levamlodipine has more selectivity and better efficacy than ("R")-amlodipine. In pooled data, from three comparative studies conducted in 200 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, 2.5 mg of levamlodipine was found to be equivalent in its blood pressure lowing efficacy to 5 mg of amlodipine. The average reduction in systolic BP was 19±3 vs 19±4, 20±2 vs 19±3 and 20±2 vs 19±3 mm of Hg recorded in standing, supine and sitting position respectively for levamlodipine compared to racemic amlodipine. The studies also reported a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels with levamlodipine, which was not seen with amlodipine.
