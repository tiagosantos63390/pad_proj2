While it is not the first Internet show, "Tom Green's House Tonight" may be the first Internet "call-in" talk show, and Green frequently cites this as an innovation. With little reliance on advertisement funding, his show is similar to Public-access television. Green often refers to it by a word he coined: "Webovision", and jokingly says he is broadcasting to "The National Internet", despite the show having a worldwide audience, and joked that his show is "the highest rated, longest running, and "only" talk show on the Internet."

It intersects a number of city streets as it heads to the northeast, traversing several mixed-use blocks before crossing over Onondaga Creek, a north–south waterway that passes through most of Syracuse.

The route continues for three more blocks along the mostly residential street to US 11, where the east end of West Kennedy Street also marks the east end of NY 175.
Space Family Robinson was published as a total of 59 issues, from 1962 to 1982. The first issue was published in December 1962. With issue #15 (January, 1966), the "Lost in Space" title was added to the cover. The book "Silver Age: The Second Generation of Comic Artists" by Daniel Herman explains that when the "Lost in Space" TV series came out in 1965, it was obvious that it was inspired, at least in part, by the comic book, but CBS, the network airing the show, had never acquired the license from Western Publishing. Rather than sue CBS or Irwin Allen, Western decided to reach a settlement that allowed them to use "Lost in Space" for the title of the comic book. Since CBS and Irwin Allen licensed shows to Western, Western didn't want to antagonize them. Also the TV show title probably helped sales of the comic book.
