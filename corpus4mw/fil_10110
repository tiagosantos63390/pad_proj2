Top Ville started the 13/10 favourite in a field of eleven colts for the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly on 3 June. He was opposed by a straong field which included Sharpman and his reportedly superior stable companion Le Marmot as well as Bellypha and High Sierra, winner of the Prix Noailles. Top Ville demonstrated what Timeform described as "tremendous power" to take the lead in the straight and open up a decisive advantage before holding off the late run of Le Marmot to win by a length, with Sharpman five lengths back in third and Bellypha in fourth. For the second time in succession, Top Ville set a new race record, covering the 2400m distance in a time of 2:25.2.

Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges and sea anemones. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine mollusks "Elysia viridis" and "Elysia chlorotica" also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive.
