Because the module system directly implements multitasking/multithreading using the Monitor concept, it solves the majority of multithreading access problems. Data for a module is bound to the code with mutexes or Mutually Exclusive Sections. Subtasks/subthreads are started transparently with the process module. Multiple subtasks/subthreads can access monitors or share modules. A share module is a module without data, which does not need the locking mechanisms of a monitor.

Consulier Industries was later renamed Mosler Automotive, which then updated the car as the Mosler Intruder and again as the Raptor before production ended by 2000. The car was replaced by the Mosler MT900 the next year.
Senior officers in the Russian Navy offered a variety of explanations for the accident. Four days after the "Kursk" sank, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief and Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision.

The arguments presented by Morocco and Mauritania were essentially similar: that either one had a sovereign right over the territory. In the case of Morocco, the kingdom of Morocco claimed the allegiance of a variety of tribes in surrounding territory. The modern Moroccan monarchy is derived from this kingdom . In the case of Mauritania, there was no clearly defined state that existed at the time. Instead, Mauritania argued that a similar entity existed which they called "bilad Chinguetti". Spain argued against Moroccan sovereignty, citing the relationship that Spanish explorers and colonizers had established with the sultan, none of which ever recognized his authority over the region. Algeria also defended the position that the Sahrawis were a distinct people, and not under the subjection of Morocco or Mauritania.

Menno Hubregtse argues that Duchamp may have chosen "Fountain" as a readymade because it parodied Robert J. Coady's exaltation of industrial machines as pure forms of American art. Coady, who championed his call for American art in his publication "The Soil", printed a scathing review of Jean Crotti's "Portrait of Marcel Duchamp (Sculpture Made to Measure)" in the December 1916 issue. Hubregtse notes that Duchamp's urinal may have been a clever response to Coady's comparison of Crotti's sculpture with "the absolute expression of a—plumber."
Description.
The Hager-Seltzer calculations omit the M and higher-energy shells on the grounds (usually valid) that those orbitals have little electron density at the nucleus and can be neglected. To first approximation this assumption is valid, upon comparing several internal conversion coefficients for different isotopes for transitions of about 100 keV.
Near the community of Dapdap, a bigger triangular muralla called Punta Diamante which encloses the church and rectory of the Parish of St. James the Greater was erected. Punta Diamante has five watchtowers with high and thick walls, making it an ideal place for refuge during Moro attacks. Unlike the other watchtowers which are cylindrical & of circular bases, the one facing the sea is of a triangular plan, a smaller version of the main complex. The biggest watchtower has a base shaped as a diamond (with 8 sides) and tapers upwards in alternating tiers. This watchtower now serves as the church's bell tower, with the old bells still comparably intact.

Greek alchemists used what they called ὕδωρ θεῖον, meaning both "divine water", and "sulphurous water". For Zosimos, the alchemical vessel was imagined as a baptismal font, and the tincturing vapours of mercury and sulphur were likened to the purifying waters of baptism, which perfected and redeemed the Gnostic initiate. Zosimos drew upon the Hermetic image of the "krater" or mixing bowl, a symbol of the divine mind in which the Hermetic initiate was "baptized" and purified in the course of a visionary ascent through the heavens and into the transcendent realms. Similar ideas of a spiritual baptism in the "waters" of the transcendent Pleroma are characteristic of the Sethian Gnostic texts unearthed at Nag Hammadi. This image of the alchemical vessel as baptismal font is central to his "Visions", discussed below.
Kline had requested that his wife, Phoebe Cates, take a small role in the film. She appeared in the bar/disco scene as the girl Joey picks up at the bar. She did this as an uncredited appearance and as a favor to her husband. She was also filming "Drop Dead Fred" at the time of her cameo in "I Love You to Death" which is why her hair looks exactly the same in both films.
As his first overseas assignment, Mr. Tang was posted to the ROC Embassy in Washington as Assistant Air Attaché from 1972 to 1975.

In 2000, Green recorded his first known demo, "Simple Songs". It was not until after this demo that he started writing under the City & Colour name. The demo contains versions of songs that were later released on this full-length albums as well as several unreleased demos of unreleased songs. It was never released publicly, and there is no known physical copy. It now circulates on the World Wide Web in mid-quality.mp3 files.
Coward first attempts to escape by masquerading as a wounded German soldier. He is taken to hospital, where his identity is revealed, but not before being awarded the Iron Cross as he lies in his hospital bed. He then digs a tunnel, and, using a map he obtains from an attractive Polish resistance contact (Maria Perschy), escapes with fellow prisoner Bill Pope (Alfred Lynch).

While the Sheepherders were enjoying the cocaine and the action in Puerto Rico, another Sheepherders team was spreading destruction all over the CWA in Memphis. For the first time, a Sheepherder team existed without Luke Williams as a member, as Jonathan Boyd teamed up with Rip Morgan (former flag bearer for the Sheepherders) to continue the legacy of violence under the name “The Kiwi Sheepherders”. Boyd and Morgan quickly made a mark on Memphis by beating their recurring nemeses, the Fabulous Ones, for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on 17 June 1985. The team was soon stripped of the titles due to their excessive cheating, but had the titles returned to them when they threatened to sue CWA management. Instead of taking the belts from the Kiwi Sheepherders by bureaucratically stripping them away, the Fabulous Ones took them from them the old fashioned way – beating them 4 times in a row between 5 September and 12 October. After the series of violent matches with the Fabulous Ones came to an end, The Kiwi Sheepherders began feuding with another team that would eventually turn out to be a constant thorn in their side: the Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). In the winter of 1985, the Kiwi Sheepherders and the Fantastics traded wins back and forth with no side gaining a clear advantage in the feud. In January 1986, the Kiwi Sheepherders defeated the team of Koko Ware and Rick Casey as well as team of Tojo Yamamoto and Dirty Rhodes to reach the finals of a tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions, but they fell in the finals to the Fantastics. This loss only intensified the Sheepherders’ anger, bringing the feud to its high point as the two teams clashed in a “No DQ Loser Leaves Town” match on 20 January 1986. The Kiwi Sheepherders lost and left Memphis, while the Fantastics rode a new wave of popularity gained from the feud.

Various bolt-on kits were produced to convert basic vehicles for specialist roles, for example tactical radio carrier, telephone line laying, field ambulance with two stretchers, and an appliqué armour kit. Strangely, the armour components were listed in the Austin civilian parts catalogue but not in the army one. A standard radio fitting kit for 1/4-ton vehicles comprising a 50-inch table running on sliding runners, battery mountings and appropriate fittings was introduced in 1956. When this kit was fitted, the vehicle was re-designated as Fitted For Radio (FFR) to differentiate it from the basisc FFW version.
