The Kansas City Royals were added to the American League in a 1969 expansion after the city's first Major League Baseball franchise departed for Oakland, California. Joe Gordon, one of two Hall of Famers to manage the Royals, was selected as the team's first manager, leading the team for one season. Bob Lemon, who took over during the 1970 season, is the second member of the Hall of Fame to lead the team, and managed until the end of 1972. Whitey Herzog is the franchise leader in regular-season wins (410) and winning percentage (.574), and Tony Muser is the loss leader (431). Dick Howser is the leader in postseason wins and losses (8â€“12), and is the only manager to lead the Royals to World Series victory. Trey Hillman led the Royals for parts of three seasons after a five-year managerial career in Japan, but was fired May 13, 2010, and replaced by current manager Ned Yost.
