Immigrant visa limits set by Congress remain at 700,000 for the combined categories of employment, family preference, and family immediate. There are additional provisions for diversity and a small number of special visas. In 2008 immigration in these categories totaled slightly less than 750,000 and similar totals (representing maximums allowed by Congress) have been tallied in recent years.

Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "ITIH1" gene.
This gene is a member of the RAD51 family of related genes, which encode strand-transfer proteins thought to be involved in recombinational repair of damaged DNA and in meiotic recombination. This gene product interacts with two other DNA repair proteins, encoded by RAD51B and XRCC3, but not with itself. The protein copurifies with XRCC3 protein in a complex, reflecting their endogenous association and suggesting a cooperative role during recombinational repair. This gene is one of four localized to a region of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors. Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing has been observed for this gene and two variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

On 22 June 1994, the City of Coburg was abolished, and, along with the City of Brunswick, was merged into the newly created City of Moreland. A tiny strip on the eastern boundary was transferred to the new City of Darebin, which incorporated the Cities of Preston and Northcote.
Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "ATP1B1" gene.
