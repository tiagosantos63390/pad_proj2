Günther von Kirchbach was born in Erfurt in 1850, the son of Hugo von Kirchbach. He entered the Prussian army in April 1868 as a second lieutenant in the Garde-Füsilier-Regiment and served with this regiment in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He married Adda Freiin von Liliencron in 1883. By 1899 Kirchbach had been promoted to "Generalmajor". In 1903 he was promoted to "Generalleutnant" and in 1907 to "General der Infanterie". From 1908 to 1911 he was commanding officer of V Corps, a command his father had previously held during the Franco-Prussian War. Kirchbach's last position before the First World War broke out was as President of the Military Tribunal.
In first-class and List A cricket, Turner played as a left-handed lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper, acting as deputy to Trevor Gard in two spells – the month of July 1984 and a week in June 1985 – when Gard was injured. He made some useful runs in first-class matches with a highest score of 27 not out in the game against Glamorgan at Taunton in 1984. He was less successful with the bat in one-day matches.

History.
Diet.
After the Anschluss of 1938, Hauser, because of his political stance, was banned by the National Socialists from working and exhibiting. In 1939 he was given an appointment in the art school of Melbourne but was prevented from taking it up by the outbreak of World War II. His wife, Gertrud Herzog-Hauser (1894–1953), to whom he had been married since 1922, was of Jewish origin and emigrated to the Netherlands, where she managed to survive the war. Hauser went into exile in Switzerland, where he wrote "Eine Geschichte vom verlorenen Sohn" (1941, privately published 1945), the novel "Zwischen gestern und morgen" (1945) and the fairytale "Maler, Tod und Jungfrau" (1946).
