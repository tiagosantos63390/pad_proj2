After the first compilation was released, that summer the label received a call from customer Henry Vasquez, who had the members of the band Nebula in his store. The bandmembers, which included founding Fu Manchu members Eddie Glass (guitar) and Ruben Romano (drums), had asked to talk with them. The band agreed to release their EP on MeteorCity, and MeteorCity offered to fund the band's recording session with Jack Endino. The result was MeteorCity's second release, the "Nebula/Lowrider" EP, which also featured tracks by Swedish band Lowrider. In 1999, the label released "Unida/Dozer", a joint EP featuring the first non-compilation tracks by Unida and Swedish band Dozer.
The first single is "Vibe" featuring Snoop Dogg, and a music video has been made for it.
