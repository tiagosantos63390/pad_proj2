The constellation Cetus lies close to the celestial equator and intersects the plane of the ecliptic, which allows it to be seen from most of the Earth's surface. However, because of its unprepossessing appearance in the sky, and its want of a "good" traditional name to supplement its esoteric Bayer designation, Tau Ceti has rarely if ever been used in a general sense, either in traditional mythologies or in the arts and literature that draw sustenance from them.

Another argument against dual-process accounts for reasoning which was outlined by Osman is that the proposed dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 does not adequately accommodate the range of processes accomplished. Moshman proposed that there should be four possible types of processing as opposed to two. They would be implicit heuristic processing, implicit rule-based processing, explicit heuristic processing, and explicit rule-based processing.

The heavy metal and hard rock aspects of the song were something unusual for the band, and the song is noted among Yes fans for being one of the band's hardest rocking songs. This is due mostly to the layering of several sheets of metallic guitars, courtesy of guitarist Steve Howe. However, there is a progressive edge that runs throughout the whole song, and even without Jon Anderson's vocals, it is easily identifiable as Yes.
However, some software engineers had misgivings. In April 2002 Bill Gates, appearing in his capacity as Microsoft's Chief Software Architect, had given sworn testimony under oath to the US Courts. Gates' testimony included statements that Microsoft Windows was indissoluble and could not be created in cut-down form. Paragraphs 207 to 223 of Gates' testimony indicated that Windows had an entangled monolithic structure, rather than a structure organised in modular fashion. Assuming Gates' testimony to be true, these 'pro-UNIX' engineers felt that open source UNIX rather than Microsoft Windows should be used as the foundation of future naval command systems and circulated their concerns within the company.

"With each trip across and back, the marker "0" moves one step closer to the centre". This is how it keeps track of how many "1"'s it has taken across.
