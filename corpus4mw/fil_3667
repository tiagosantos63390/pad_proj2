Windows Vista included support for peer-to-peer protocols. It also included a new version of the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRPv2). Windows Vista also included a peer-to-peer API for name resolution and secure "Group" creation. This functionality can be accessed from the Winsock API as well. The peer-to-peer networking subsystem can discover others running the service in the local subnet, using a feature dubbed "People Near Me" and integrate with "Windows Contacts" to store their information. This facility can be used to develop ad-hoc collaborative applications, such as Windows Meeting Space. Peer-to-peer networking settings are configurable through "netsh p2p" and Group Policy.
