Doctrines are simply stated by the UCKG; no evidence for them, or for any fundamental beliefs, is given. The UCKG Web site lists "case studies", with names but no other identifying information, of people who are reported to have benefited from UCKG membership. Categories are "Deliverance", "Family Finances", "Love Life", "Transformation of Life", and "Health and Spiritual Healing". A typical example is a man writing that he had a criminal record and was in debt, who thought that the UCKG "Campaign of Israel" would restore his financial situation, and said that he cleared his debts and changed his character, ultimately being phoned out of the blue by a company who had heard good things about his work, and gave him a responsible, well-paid job, which he considered due to the Campaign. A name and location (Stanford Hill) is given, but no other supporting information.
