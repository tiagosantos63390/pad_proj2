History.
Building work on the church started in 1885. The architect was J. W. Lunn from Malvern, Worcestershire who also designed St. Catherine's Church in Chipping Campden. On 8 September 1896 it was opened by Bishop John Vertue. Baroness Pauline von Hugel decided to give the church to the Society of Jesus so that Father de Lapasture SJ became the first parish priest. The church was built to have a height of fifty metres along the nave and could accommodate a congregation of 400 people.
An EP of remixes of tracks from "The New Life", entitled "The Next Life", was released in October 2013 in digital and vinyl formats. Both formats also include a cover version of the Brian Eno song, "Third Uncle".
