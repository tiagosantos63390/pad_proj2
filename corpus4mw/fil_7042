Most of the Freedmen were former slaves of tribal members who had lived in both upper and lower Creek territories in the Southeast. In some villages, Creek citizens married enslaved men or women, and had mixed-race children with them. Interracial marriages were common during this time, and many Creek Freedmen were partly of Creek Indian ancestry.

In linguistics, TEVL (always written as uppercase T plus uppercase EVL in subscript) is an abbreviation for the time of evaluation, a secondary temporal reference in establishing tense. It is used determining tense of generalizations and habitual truths. In these types of utterances, there is no specific verb occurrence to observe (and thus no assertion). Instead, the purpose of such utterances is to merely inform. In these utterances, a generalization or an habitual truth is attested as true (or questioned for trueness in interrogative forms). The earliest point at which these attestations can be evaluated as true or not serves as the secondary temporal reference for such constructions.
Capital punishment is applied in this state.
