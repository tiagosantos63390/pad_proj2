Despite being part of the squad that travelled to Italy for pre season, Holt had to wait until the last day of the 2010–11 season to make his First team debut on 15 May 2011 as a substitute against Dundee United. His performance for the under 19 squad in the early part of the 2011–12 season earned him a new three-year contract extending his stay with the club until 2014. With Hearts in financial difficulty and wanting to bring through members of their under 19 squad into the first team, Holt was sent on loan to Raith Rovers to gain first team experience. He scored on his first start for Hearts away to St Johnstone in March 2012.
Additionally, the Army has a number of other flags. There is a "regimental color," housed at the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School, that shows the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a dark blue background, with a banner reading "Chaplain Corps" underneath it. There is also a "positional color," housed in the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, showing the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a white background, with a banner reading "United States Army" underneath it. Also, like all flag and general officers, both the Army Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains are authorized personal flags with one or two stars respectively, in accordance with their rank—but unlike most other Army general officer flags that have the white stars shown against a scarlet background, as of 1952 the color of the Chaplain Corps general officer flag background is "ecclesiastical purple." The Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains of the Navy do not have distinctive flags, but instead use flags with blue stars superimposed on a white background along with other staff corps officers not eligible for command at sea, while line officers (those eligible for command at sea) use flags with white stars against a blue background. In the Air Force, all general officers including the Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains use the same individual (rank) flags, with white stars indicating rank against a blue background.
During Summer 2012 the first phase of the University Library redevelopment project was completed. In recent years the floors of the Library were upgraded to create a modern and vibrant learning space which is flexible, comfortable and accessible. During June 2012 the Jordanhill Library was closed and stock and services were integrated into this Library on the John Anderson campus. This project brought all Library and information services into a single location, delivering a one-stop shop to the users. There is a greater variety of learning environments offered, with more group study areas and improved silent study spaces. Relevant technology is now available throughout the building. Digital collections are continually being enhanced, opening hours are being increased and environmental conditions such as heating, lighting and ventilation have all been upgraded.

Bo Welch was then attached to the project with Colin Firth starring as Harry Deane, with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Kingsley attached. After the box office failure of Welch's 2003 live action film of Dr Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" Universal got cold feet and the project was again put into turnaround. Outside of the studio system Lobell moved between different financiers in a bid to get the project moving. One group, Alcon Entertainment, had Gerard Butler lined up as Harry Deane, with Richard LaGravenese directing. LaGravenese wanted a script polish, which took a long time, removing a lot of the work the Coen Brothers had done. Again the project was stalled.
