To develop their online presence and give customers an alternative way to shop with the company, Ace launched an online version of their catalogue; 24Ace. This began in 2002 when customers received a copy of the catalogue on CD, allowing them to browse the Ace catalogue offline on their PC. The presentation was then enhanced to produce the 24Ace catalogue online. In 2003, the full website was launched.

The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is the response to the body after endotoxins are released by the death of harmful organisms in the human body, starts usually during the first day of antibiotic treatment. The reaction increases the person's body temperature, decreases the overall blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic levels), and results in leukopenia and rigors in the body. This reaction can occur during any treatment of spirochete diseases.
