In 1923 Stenhouse married Gladys Mackintosh, Aeneas Mackintosh's widow, and in 1924 a daughter was born. Between 1927 and 1929 he captained the "Discovery" on oceanographic and whaling research voyages in Southern Atlantic and Antarctic waters. Thereafter he attempted several business ventures which largely failed, as did an attempt to find treasure in the Cocos Islands. At the outbreak of World War II Stenhouse, now a Commander RNR, signed on for active service and, whilst in the Gulf of Aden in 1940, risked his own life to save that of a crew member after his ship was struck by a mine. On 12 September 1941 he was reported missing, presumed killed, when his ship exploded and sank in the Red Sea.
