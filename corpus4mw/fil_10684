A small group of Air Force law enforcement alumni launched a police museum and memorial on October 8th, 2014 to help safeguard history they feared was in danger of being lost following the shuttering of the 35-year-old Security Forces Museum at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in August. Budget cuts forced the closure of the base museum, where artifacts told the story of the Air Force’s largest career field and a Hall of Honor memorialized those killed in the line of duty in war and peace. Officials have tried to assure present and former security forces airmen — known as air police and security police over the decades — that their proud history is not going anywhere. A yet-to-be-built enlisted heritage and character development center that would include those artifacts and memorials as well as represent other Air Force jobs could open as early as 2017. In the meantime, the museum is open for training and by appointment until the best exhibits are put on display at an interim facility sometime next year. But none of that appeased many security forces alumni who said they felt blindsided — and marginalized — by the closing. Thousands joined a “Save the Security Forces Museum” Facebook page and signed a White House petition pleading for a reversal of the decision. 
In 1984, Matt Goldsby and Jimmy Simmons bombed several abortion clinics. Both had an extensive association with Burt, who called himself their "spiritual adviser," and picketed their trial. He later denied responsibility in influencing the bombers.
