The conformationally altered form of PrPC is PrPSc. Some groups believe PrPSc is the infectious agent (prion agent) in TSEs, while other groups do not. PrPSc could be a neuropathological product of the disease process, a component of the infectious agent, the infectious agent itself, or something else altogether. Regardless of what its actual function in the disease state is, PrPSc is clearly specifically associated with the disease process, and detection of it indicates infection with the agent causing prion diseases.
