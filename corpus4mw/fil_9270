According to the recollections of Jimmy Wormworth, who was invited to perform at Le Chat Qui Pêche in August 1957 with his American Jazz Quintet (comprising Wormworth as drummer and leader, Roland Ashby on piano, Sal Amico on trumpet, Barry Rogers on trombone and George Braithwaite on alto saxophone): "I was told that we made her club so successful, because there were many bus tours coming to hear us, that, after us, Madame Ricard hired many famous American jazz musicians, so that she had the funds to add another floor in the club...I don't know if that's true, but I think it was the late Al Levitt, who told me that, because he stayed in Paris, after we came back to the USA."
The term fine adjustment screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra fine adjustment screw has been used to refer to 100-254 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.1 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO metric screw thread designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.
