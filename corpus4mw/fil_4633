"Bubble Trouble" is a remake of "All Gummed Up", using ample stock footage. The new footage was filmed on October 13, 1952, nearly one year before the film's release. Critics and fans alike have observed that this film has a significantly better plot structure than the original, "All Gummed Up". In the original, the climax occurs approximately four minutes before the end of the film, leaving room for a bubblegum cake scene. In "Bubble Trouble", however, the bubblegum cake scene comes before the climax of the film. Both the original and the remake were directed by Jules White.

Water immersion objectives are used not only at very large magnifications that require high resolving power, but also of moderate power as there are water immersion objectives as low as 4X. Objectives with high power magnification have short focal lengths, facilitating the use of water. The water is applied to the specimen (conventional microscope), and the stage is raised, immersing the objective in water. Sometimes with water dipping objectives, the objective is directly immersed in the solution of water which contains the specimens to look at. Electrophoretic preparations used for instance in the cases of Comet Essay can benefit largely with water objectives.

In the Blockade of Almeida (14 April – 10 May 1811) a French garrison under Antoine François Brenier de Montmorand was surrounded by approximately 13,000 Anglo-Allied soldiers led by Generals Sir Alexander Campbell, 1st Baronet and Sir William Erskine, 2nd Baronet. After a French relief attempt failed, Brenier and his troops broke out at night after blowing up portions of the fortress. To the fury of the British army commander Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington, most of the French escaped due to their commander's single-minded determination, British fumbling, and remarkably good luck. The action took place during the Peninsular War portion of the Napoleonic Wars. Almeida, Portugal is located near the Spanish border about northeast of Lisbon. The town was originally captured from a Portuguese garrison during the 1810 Siege of Almeida.
