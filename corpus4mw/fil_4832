Early career.
After their victory over Florida, Alabama reentered the AP Poll at the No. 17 position and Ole Miss dropped from No. 5 to No. 7 in the week prior to their match-up at Jackson. Against the Rebels, the Crimson Tide were defeated 48–23 behind a strong performance by Ole Miss quarterback Archie Manning before a nationally televised audience. The Rebels took a 14–0 first quarter lead after Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Garland Reed and later scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Alabama scored their first points on a 36-yard Richard Ciemny field goal early in the second quarter. However on the kickoff that ensued, Vernon Studdard returned it 101-yards for a touchdown and extended the Ole Miss lead to 20–3 after the conversion failed. Both teams then traded touchdowns to close the first half. Manning connected from 14-yards to Reed for the Rebels and Neb Hayden connected from 15-yards to Jerry Cash for Alabama that made the halftime score 26–9.
