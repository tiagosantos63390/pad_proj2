Since 2011, the Mose control center and management functions for the lagoon system have been located in the Venice Arsenal, symbol of the former trading and military might of the historic "Serenissima" or "Serene Republic". Numerous historical buildings, in a state of decay and abandonment for decades, have already been restored and reorganisation of the area is underway to accommodate these new activities.
