Hughes began the first of a projected four-volume biography of Washington in October, 1926. Based on extensive research, "George Washington: The Human Being and the Hero" covered his life up to the age of thirty. Volume two, "George Washington: The Rebel and the Patriot", published in 1927, examined Washington's life prior to and in the early years of the American Revolution from 1762 to 1777. The third volume, 1930's "George Washington: Savior of the States, 1777–1781" further examined Washington as a military leader during some of the revolutions darkest days. Hailed by historians as a groundbreaking work, it repaired much of the damage done to Huges reputation. An intended fourth volume covering George Washington and his role as our first President was never completed.

Digo women do a tremendous amount of labor, but excluded from participating in politics, religion, kinship issues, and major economic transactions. Their culture generally regards women as childlike and irresponsible. Spirit possession sometimes occurs among the women. The Digo refer to the spirits in question as "shaitani". The "shaitani" typically demands luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as genuine condition and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, sometimes men suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.
