Section I was intended to address an alleged recent growth of Catholicism by ensuring the existing anti-Catholic laws were more strongly applied. To this end, it provided that any person who apprehended a "Popish Bishop, Priest or Jesuite" who was then prosecuted for "saying Mass or exerciseing any other Part of the Office or Function of a Popish Bishop or Priest within these Realmes" was to receive £100 from the Sheriff of that county within four months of the priest's conviction. In effect, it placed a bounty on Catholic priests. Section II provided for the Treasury to reimburse Sheriffs for money expended on such payments.

Robbie Beckett (born July 16, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. In 1990, he was drafted in the first round (25th) by the San Diego Padres in the amateur draft out of McCallum High School in Austin, Texas. Starting out for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in the Padre's farm system, he was soon well known for his impressive 100 mph fastballs at the young age of 21. During one stretch of his stint at the Quakes, he was able to throw 88 strikeouts in 84 innings. However, Beckett's extreme fastballs were counterbalanced by his poor control. During one spring training session, veteran MLB hitters refused to go to bat against such a powerful and erratic pitch and risk injury so early in the season. Unable to make progress in the Padres farm system, the team waived Beckett on March 29, 1996. The Florida Marlins picked Beckett up but soon waived him also. After Florida, the Colorado Rockies selected Beckett off waivers. Beckett made his Major League debut with the Rockies on September 12, 1996 when he was only 24 years old. Robbie Beckett was a left-handed pitcher, but batted with his right. Beckett only played in a total of 7 games (none of which he started), and was released from the Colorado Rockies on September 26, 1997.
Morrow struggled throughout early spring training, giving up 7 earned runs through just 8 innings pitched. On March 18, manager John Gibbons confirmed that Morrow would be the team's fifth starter, citing a need to give him more time to prepare for the regular season. After struggling to open the season, including a start on April 26 where he walked 8 Red Sox batters over 2 innings, Morrow was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 3 with a sprained right index finger. Later that day his injury was determined to be a more severe torn tendon sheath in his right hand, and he was transferred to the 60-day DL. Morrow made his first rehab appearance on August 27 with the Dunedin Blue Jays, pitching one scoreless inning. He was activated from the 60-day DL and added to the Blue Jays active roster on September 1, 2014.
