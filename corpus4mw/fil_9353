Before the Great War, Laws was an amateur photographer who on his own initiative experimented with photography from lighter-than-air aircraft. His military career began in the Coldstream Guards and the Royal Engineers, and he served in Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as well as in the Camel Corps. In 1912, Laws “presented himself for a trade test at the headquarters of the Military Wing of the created Royal Flying Corps then located at South Farnborough."
