The local chapter of the NAACP and the State's Attorney General struggled to indict some of the lynch mob, but no one was ever charged for the murders of Shipp and Smith, nor the attack on Cameron.
Belle-Isle’s military and political reputation was now at its height, and he was one of the government’s principal advisers on military and diplomatic affairs. In 1741 he was sent on diplomatic mission to Frankfurt, Germany as French Plenipotentiary to carry out, in the interests of France, a grand scheme of political reorganization in the moribund empire, and especially to obtain the election of Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria as emperor. The long tradition of Franco-Austrian rivalry had crystallized around Belle-Isle, who had emerged as the leader of the bellicose bloc of French policy makers towards the House of Austria. In the eventful year of 1741, he was at the masthead of French interventionist policy in Germany—characterized by scholar Richard Lodge as a “scheme for the humiliation of the House of Austria,”—and of the beginnings of the War of the Austrian Succession. French aggression was in large part made possible by the precedent set by the Frederick II of Prussia and his conquest of Silesia—often referred to as the Rape of Silesia. France’s initial victories—including the election of Charles Albert to Holy Roman Emperor—were short lived, and by 1743 the war was proving to be very disappointing for France, as Belle-Isle’s military command in Germany was full of setbacks and losses. His aggressive strategy towards Austria was predicated on the swift defeat of an impotent and disorganized Austria, along with the lynchpin that was Franco-Prussian alliance.

Ferns, mushrooms and other plants which require tree cover and a lot of humus started appearing after just a few years in the forest. At first only a few species were found flourishing but more species are now appearing, some on branches, trunks of dead wood and on the rock cliff faces. Leaf shedding ants are useful in cutting leaves into small pieces. The ants work day and night. Their leaf shredding habit and their fungal cultivation are beneficial to the forest. These types of ants are many, an example being the weaver ants. The termites are also in large numbers in our forest. The termites feed on soft timber trunks, thus they are usually considered as pests, but they play a great role in reducing the dead wood in forests to humus.

Larger fish, even predator fish such as the great barracuda in the photo on the left, often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way. Skindivers who remain for long periods in the water, also often attract a retinue of fish, with smaller fishes coming in close, and larger fishes observing from a greater distance. Marine turtles, functioning as a mobile shelter for small fish, can be impaled accidentally by a swordfish trying to catch the fish.
The official state marker at the site, placed in 1930, reads: "Upon the rock fifty feet West of this spot Mary Rowlandson wife of the first minister of Lancaster was redeemed from captivity under King Philip. The narrative of her experience is one of the classics of colonial literature."

Fleeing from defeat, the Phocians ran to the sea, where Chares' fleet had arrived during the battle, but many men were killed during the pursuit, or drowned as they tried to reach the ships. In total, 6,000 Phocian troops had been killed including Onomarchos, and another 3000 taken prisoner. Onomarchos was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as ritual demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians. Buckler states that: "Nor should one automatically assume that a mass-drowning...would shock the Greek world. Even the mild-tempered Isocrates felt that the Phocian mercenaries were better off dead than alive...Dreadful indeed was the punishment, but it was entirely consistent with Philip's role as Apollo's champion".
It could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School (see Gudmundsson, 2007).

Quite successful in the first half of the sixteenth century, as the republication of her works attest, Helisenne de Crenne was largely forgotten by the beginning of the seventeenth century. Her work was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century by the French literary scholars Gustave Reynier (who wrote about her novel in his "Le Roman sentimental avant l'Astrée" (1908)) and Verdun-Léon Saulnier. Since the 1980s, her works have gained increased attention by literary scholars and have been translated into the English language because both of her historical status as an author and her significance to women's literary history.
Risner became an ace in the Korean War, and commanded a squadron of F-105 Thunderchiefs in the first missions of Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965. He flew a combined 163 combat missions, was shot down twice, and was credited with destroying eight MiG-15s. Risner retired as a brigadier general in 1976.

Meanwhile Rose Ratliff (Tomlin) has risen to the office of forewoman at the Hollowmade Factory, and her personality is also very career-oriented, setting her personal life aside, while Sadie Ratliff (Midler) has always felt misplaced in rural life and wishes for a more sophisticated life in a big city. In her capacity as forewoman, Rose finds out Moramax's plans and fears that the off-loading of the company might bring a radical change of lifestyle for the people of Jupiter Hollow, so she makes plans to travel to New York City and stop the sale; faced with the prospect of traveling to (and probably staying in) New York, Sadie agrees to join her sister.

Samuel Cromwell (died December 1, 1842) was a sailor and petty officer {boatswain's mate} aboard the brig USS "Somers". Cromwell was feared by the young apprentices who made up the majority of the ship's crew, and was rumored to have served on a slaver at one time. These rumors lent credence to the idea that he would have been amenable to Philip Spencer's alleged plot to mutiny, kill the ship's officers and such of the crewmembers as were not wanted, and sail the "Somers" either as a pirate ship or a slaver. 
"Play Like a Girl", Millington and her sister Jean’s most recent album, was released in August 2011 on Millington's label Fabulous Records. Millington explained its purpose:

Flynn Primary School and Preschool were one of only four school complexes designed by award-winning architect Enrico Taglietti, and is considered to be a good example of his dramatic application of twentieth century organic architecture. The Primary School was the first fully open-plan school in the ACT. The grounds also contain a National Memorial to the Royal Flying Doctors' Reverend John Flynn and a separate memorial to George Simpson. Taglietti called the school one of his most important works.
