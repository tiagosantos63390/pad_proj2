The 326th Fighter Group was activated at Mitchel Field, NY in August 1942 and moved the next month to Bradley Field, CT. It was initially assigned the 320th,321st, and 322d Fighter Squadrons (FS). The 326th performed an air defense mission for First Air Force in the northeast during 1942 and 1943 while also conducting operational training. As an operational training unit, it was an oversized parent unit which provided cadres to "satellite groups." It later became a replacement training unit, remaining an oversized unit, but preparing individual pilot for combat duty in Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. In October 1943, the group moved to Seymour Johnson Field, NC, but two of its squadrons, the 320th FS and the 442d FS remained behind and were assigned to another group. These two squadrons were replaced by the 538th and 539th FS.

In the "Pokémon" anime, Ash catches a Heracross in the episode "A Sappy Ending". The Heracross is powerful, but also is distracted by sap, to the point where it tries to feed off the nectar of Ash's Bulbasaur's flower bulb when Bulbasaur is in sight, often forcing Bulbasaur to use Vine Whip to stop Heracross. It is currently at Professor Oak's lab and is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in both the Japanese- and English-language versions of the anime.
