At least 235 marine species are found in both Antarctica and the Arctic, ranging in size from whales and birds to small marine snails, sea cucumbers, and mud-dwelling worms. The large animals often migrate between the two, and smaller animals are expected to be able to spread via underwater currents. Antarctic animals have adapted to reduce heat loss, often developing warm windproof coats and layers of blubber.
On 6 December 2012, the presiding judge of ICT-1, Mohammed Nizamul Huq, passed an order requiring two members of "The Economist" to appear before the court, demanding that they explain how they came into possession of e-mails and conversations between him and lawyer Ziauddin. This order came after "The Economist" contacted Huq about the material they had. The order named Ahmed Ziauddin as an expert assisting the judges, explaining that the judges needed research support as the tribunal is based on new law.

Riccobono directly influenced Roman law scholarship in the United States, as well. In 1928-29, the Catholic University of America invited him to give a course in Roman law. He gave one series of lectures on the “Evolution of Roman Law from the Law of the Twelve Tables to Justinian,” and a second on the “Influence of Christianity on Roman Law in the IV and V Centuries A.D.” In response to these lectures, the Catholic University created “The Riccobono Seminar of Roman Law in America,” which operated until 1956. Many of the best regarded Roman law scholars in America, as well as guests from foreign countries, presented papers at the Seminar, and Riccobono himself remained in contact with it as he could for decades. He was appointed Magister of the seminar for life, and for many years, he reported on the Seminar’s activities in the Roman law journal he edited—the Bullettino dell’Istituto di Diritto Romano.

The castle was first mentioned in the historic record as "castrum Wissenowe" in 1298. It is unclear whether it was built by the Lords of Rotenfluh (Unspunnen) and then given in fief to the Freiherr of Weissenau or if it was built by the Weissenau family as the center of their estates. The castle was built on what was an island at the mouth of the Aare river into Lake Thun. In the intervening centuries, the waterway silted up and the island became connected to shore. The market town of Widen grew up across the channel from the castle and in 1362 was connected to the castle by a bridge. Around 1334, the Freiherr of Weissenau joined other local nobles in a war against the growing power of the city of Bern. After the defeat of the nobles, Weissenau was forced to sell the castle and Widen to Interlaken Abbey to pay his debts. In 1365, the Abbey moved the weekly markets and yearly fair away from Widen and to the village of Aarmühle (which is now Interlaken). Losing the market devastated Widen and it began to decline.
