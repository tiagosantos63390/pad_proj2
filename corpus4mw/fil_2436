"The Lost Tomb of Jesus" is a documentary co-produced and first broadcast on the Discovery Channel and Vision TV in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the Talpiot Tomb. It was directed by Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and Ric Esther Bienstock, while James Cameron served as executive producer. The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, "The Jesus Family Tomb", issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and Charles R. Pellegrino. The documentary and book's claims are disputed by most experts within the archaeological and theological fields, as well as among most linguistic and biblical scholars.
