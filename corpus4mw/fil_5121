There is a work of his written in Greek, which he directed against one Agarenus, a Muslim. The beginning of the refutation is lost; the title as given by Étienne Le Moine is "Elenchus et Confutatio Agareni". This work may be read in the Migne collection This treatise, as it now stands, opens with a statement of the objections of Muslims against Christianity, among which are the dogmas of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, and of confession. Bartholomew then gives his answers, and makes many counter-charges against Mohammed and his revelation.

In January of the same season, the club made the first round of the FA Cup after two seasons of elimination in its qualifying rounds, but a 2–1 defeat at Bristol City ensued. A year later, in the same competition, Blackpool enjoyed their finest moment to date: after beating Crystal Palace over three games, they were drawn at home to the powerful Sheffield United. The board, mindful about financial restrictions, "sold" the ground rights and agreed to play at Bramall Lane. Despite protests from the Blackpool support, the move was agreed, and on 3 February 1906, Blackpool travelled to South Yorkshire and won the game 2–1. What made the victory all the more sweet for the club was that they still made around £300 from the game. They banked a further £650 from the third-round tie at Newcastle United, which they lost 5–0 in front of 35,000 fans.
