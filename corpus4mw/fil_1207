The site of Somerset-Bridlewood was originally opened as 162nd Ave Station in spring of 1996 as a temporary platform on the CP-Rail line to provide access to a conventional rail service during peak rush hour periods to a platform at Anderson station. The service only lasted five months but the ridership proved popular and led to the priority decision to complete the South extension. The modern station was built on the site of the temporary platform when the C-Train service was extended south and re-opened as Somerset-Bridlewood on June 28, 2004. 
As a side note, both the 1905 treaty (and by extension the 1907 treaty) and the 1910 annexation treaty were declared "already null and void" when the normalization of relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan was negotiated in 1965.

History.

The game was designed by game developer Roberta Williams. Actress Victoria Morsell spent months in front of a bluescreen filming the hundreds of actions players could direct her character to perform. The game script was about 550 pages long, four times the size of a regular movie script, and an additional 100 pages of storyboards set the style for the over 800 scenes in the game. The game required four months of filming alone and over 200 people were involved in the production, not counting the Gregorian choir of 135 people that was used for parts of the music in the game. The final chase sequence took a week to film.
Now the "Autobiography" discusses "the Rise and Progress of [Franklin's] Philosophical Reputation." He starts experiments with electricity and writes letters about them that are published in England as a book. Franklin's description of his experiments is translated into French, and Abbé Nollet, who is offended because this work calls into question his own theory of electricity, publishes his own book of letters attacking Franklin. Declining to respond on the grounds that anyone could duplicate and thus verify his experiments, Franklin sees another French author refute Nollet, and as Franklin's book is translated into other languages, its views are gradually accepted and Nollet's are discarded. Franklin is also voted an honorary member of the Royal Society.
