Even so, the hold of the disinherited lords was no more certain than before. By September 1334 Edward Balliol, faced with a full-scale revolt, sent urgent appeals to England for yet more assistance. To make matters even worse his followers, who had been brought together by greed for land, were driven apart by the very same greed. In a dispute over the estates of Alexander de Mowbray, killed at Annan in 1332, Balliol was unwise enough to quarrel with Beaumont who, in the fashion of Achilles, withdrew from Court in a fit of picque, to Dundarg.

The Blackstones were a Beatles-influenced quartet who performed and recorded many original compositions penned by Boyan, with McGeorge as collaborator. The Blackstones performed with a number of high profile rock acts during 1965, including The Byrds, The Beau Brummels and Herman's Hermits. The band developed a significant following and, as a result, was invited to play at The Cellar a teen dance club in Arlington Heights, Illinois, home of house band The Shadows of Knight. There the Blackstones became a sensation, with McGeorge's guitar and vocal skills a major factor in their success. The Blackstones disintegrated in Fall 1965 after two members, bassist Tom Osborne and drummer David Blanchard, were drafted into the US Army.

In 1792 the Venetian Government accorded him the title of Vicar-General of Dalmatia and as Vicar General and Archimandrite he made an episcopal visitation and carried out many reforms in church and social life. He was confirmed in office by the Austrians in 1797 but in 1806 the French, then rulers of Dalmatia, suspected his loyalty and detained him in Zadar. However he was released after a while and in 1808 he was permitted to go to Milan to request the Viceroy Prince Eugène, to ask Napoleon to allow the appointments of Orthodox bishops in Dalmatia, which Venice refused to permit. Napoleon soon granted this request and in 1810 Zelić was in Paris on an ecclesiastical deputation to him in the same connection. During the stay of the deputation Napoleon tricked Zelić by appointing a somewhat mysterious and shady figure by the name of Benedikt Kraljević as Bishop of Dalmatia and Zelić himself as Kraljević's subordinate, Vicar Bishop of Boka Kotorska. Napoleon's navy had previously tried to take Boka Kotorska but were repelled by the overwhelming presence of the British and Russian fleets ensconced there. Soon Zelić and Kraljević parted ways and towards the end of 1811 Zelić resigned his vicarship and retired to Krupa Monastery. With the defeat of Napoleon and the return of the Austrians Kraljević showed his true colours by embracing Roman Catholicism. Zelić, on the other hand, paid for his opposition by being confined from 1820, first in Vienna and then in Buda, where he died on 26 March 1828.

The song is made up of fragments from 1950s sub-genre horror and science fiction films and likened to that of avant-garde artist Tristan Tzara by author Vera Dika in her book, "Recycled Culture in Contemporary Art and Film". Tzara would construct poems by taking snippets of words from newspapers and placing them into a bag to randomly draw from and arrange. Instead, the words in "Science Fiction Double Feature" are purposely made to rhyme with a set structure and set with phrases that create cohesion.
