The Fall Series saw major changes for 2009, with one of its events moving to May and another dropping off the schedule entirely. It returned to its original start date of the week after the Tour Championship. Then, as in 2008, it took a week off, this time for the Presidents Cup. It then continued with events in three consecutive weeks, took another week off for the HSBC Champions (now elevated to World Golf Championships status), and concluded the week after that.
The de Ville was originally a trim level and later a model of General Motors' Cadillac marque. The first car to bear the name was the 1949 Coupe de Ville, a prestige trim level of the Series 62 luxury coupe. The last model to be formally known as a De Ville was the 2005 Cadillac DeVille, a full-size sedan, the largest car in the Cadillac model range at the time. The next year, the DeVille was officially renamed DTS (an abbreviation standing for DeVille Touring Sedan, itself a trim level on earlier models).

The Biggest exhibit is a locomotive named Nellie, after Nellie Crane the vicar's wife. Nellie is an 0-4-0 saddle tank industrial locomotive 1435, one of two built by Hudswell Clarke in Leeds in 1922 for the Esholt sewage works. When the works were being built, she carried excavated material, and thereafter coal and construction material, then coal and other materials until 1970 when she was loaned to the Yorkshire Dales Railway Society at Skipton. Her size is ca.23 x 8 x 11 ft, and she weighs 28 tons. The boiler works at 160psi, and she carries 700 gallons in the saddle water tank. The cylinders are 40-inch diameter 20-inch stroke operated by Stephenson's open link valve gear. A British Railways Crane Wagon is on display outside near the museum gates.

In the early 1920s the cutlery business faced a serious setback as Germany was permitted to export shears and scissors duty-free to the United States. The idea behind this was to help Germany pay back its World War I debts. As a consequence, German shears were sold at half the price of American made shears. Despite the fierce German competition, Fremont counted twenty-five cutlery businesses and was rightfully known as the "Cutlery Center of the World".
Barnacle died in 1921, having been nursed during his illness by his estranged wife, Annie.

Breeders' Cup Classic top three finishers
The second major tornado produced by the Franklin supercell was initially observed to the east of Liberal (5:31 pm). Analysis indicated a wide damage path through rural portions of Barton County, Missouri. Several structures received F1 to F2 damage. The tornado crossed into Cedar County and continued producing high end F2/low end F3 damage. One man was killed east of Liberal when his home was destroyed. As it approached the town of Stockton, several framed houses were swept off their foundations. Structural analysis indicated poor anchoring of the homes, thus warranting a high end F3 rating. The funnel then proceeded travel through the center of Stockton causing considerable devastation, and killing three. The tornado was approximately in diameter as it left Stockton. A two-story frame home to the east of Stockton was almost entirely destroyed, and several vehicles were tossed hundreds of feet (also high end F3). Also, almost all the buildings in the downtown square of Stockton were destroyed, and the only thing left at a bank was the vault. The roof was torn off of most of the Stockton school, but the court house, just south of the square only sustained minor damage. The city was closed off to the public for nearly two days. The tornado crossed into northern Polk County, and appeared to have weakened slightly. A handful of structures received F1 and F2 damage. Continuing all the way through Polk County, it shrank to approximately in diameter as it entered Dallas County. Damage analysis indicated twin funnels in western Polk (another tornado touched down just to the south of the parent funnel) (Observers did confirm twin tornadoes on the ground near Humansville, Missouri in northwest polk county). Over 48 homes were destroyed in northern Dallas county (again F3 damage), and two additional fatalities occurred. South of Tunas, its track shifted from northeasterly to almost east-southeasterly. It then proceeded to abruptly weaken and dissipate. The Stockton tornado had traveled for miles, across four counties in their entirety. One year after the tornado hit a plaque was placed at the town park in honor of the three men who lost their lives there. The tornado killed a total of 6 people along its path.

She wanted to keep the original Five Tibetan Rites as authentic as possible, but she had noticed a pattern among students participating in the workshops that she ran. Despite very detailed instruction and personal attention, a small percentage of students in every workshop who would develop lower back or neck pain. This would result in them having to cease doing their daily practice, or even visit various health practitioners for treatment.
