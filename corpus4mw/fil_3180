He also had two siblings, Paul Lawrence and Dorothy Medesta. His love affair with music began when his father brought home a piano, quickly learning how to play additional instruments. In high school, he participated in band.
The abbey was founded by Saint Martin of Tours (316-397), in 372, after he had been made Bishop of Tours in 371. Martin's biographer, Sulpicius Severus, affirms that Martin withdrew from the press of attention in the city to live in Marmoutier (Majus Monasterium), the monastery he founded several miles from Tours on the opposite shore of the Loire River.
Oakey was apprenticed to a piano maker where he learnt to make sandpaper by glueing sand or powdered glass onto paper. He developed a better process suitable for mass-production and set up in business at Walworth, London in 1833, before moving his business to Wellington Mill at Westminster Bridge Road. He subsequently developed many wet and dry sand and emery papers, and a range of polishing compounds including lead blacking, "Wellington" Knife Polish, Silversmith's Soap and Plate Powder, and furniture polishes.

Standard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools used to be the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, simply because they were the simplest tools to manufacture by early blacksmiths. Standard Tuckpointing Tools come in widths from as little as 1mm to up to 14mm wide. So these tools can be used for very fine detailed work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.
