However, the film received a number of negative reviews. The film was awarded a 44% rating by the website Rotten Tomatoes. Brian Gibson of the "Vue Weekly" in Edmonton said of the film, "The tiresome zaniness and Seinfeldian conceits might be forgivable if the romantic plot weren’t so full of empty truisms and nonsense lines that would stump a Zen monk." Film critic Christopher Null criticized the directing of Deepa Mehta, saying, "director Deepa Mehta does nothing to make this palatable. In fact, she goes out of her way to distance us from the story and the characters, most notably through washing the entire movie into total gray, giving it just a hint of color (in the end, the movie brightens up in a particularly awful scene that has animated flowers growing over the frame). Wintry symbolism has never felt so forced—and in a film that ought to have been played as a romantic comedy, it's never been more out of place, either."
