Scott was the Toronto Blue Jays opening day left fielder in their first ever game on April 7, 1977, and was the first batter in team history, as he led off the bottom of the first inning, as Chicago White Sox pitcher Ken Brett struck out Scott. He finished the game going 1 for 5 with a double. On June 5, Scott hit his first career home run off of Vida Blue of the Oakland Athletics. He ended the season appearing in 79 games with the club, batting .240 with 2 HR and 15 RBI, while finishing second on the Blue Jays with 10 stolen bases. On December 16, the Blue Jays traded Scott to the St. Louis Cardinals to complete an earlier deal in which the Jays traded Pete Vuckovich to St. Louis for Victor Cruz and Tom Underwood.
