The "Camp World" that children were brought into was completely different from the world pictured in "The Primer". Camp life brought entirely new experience, created new concepts for children such as: hunger, selection, gas chamber – as well as daily contact with evil and death. Living in the camp caused distortion, deformed and destroyed the children's psyche. Along the walls of "The Primer World" there are pre-war primers in Polish, Belarusian and Hebrew. Four children's names are written in white chalk on the school board, those whose fates are presented in the exhibition. A hum of a school corridor is sounded in the room, and one can hear screams and pushing shouts of children during a school break.

“T"he seats of 1/3 of the Senators and of 1/2 of the Deputies were to be filled in the congressional elections of 1930. The two major parties, Liberal and Conservative, were the only contestants, as the Liberal Republican Party did not qualify under the terms of the electoral law. The elections, which were held on 2 November 1930, resulted in the election of 7 Liberal Senators and 16 Deputies and 2 Conservative Senators and 6 Deputies. The total vote cast was approximately 70 percent of that in the same districts in 1928".”

The control of Vijithapura was essential to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.

Like the Rangers, the Giants and their fans have had a long history of futility and disappointment since their move from New York City to San Francisco before the 1958 season. The Giants had won their last World Series against the Cleveland Indians in . After the move, they made it to the Series three times but lost each time. These included a seven-game loss to the New York Yankees in , a four-game sweep by their cross-bay rival Oakland Athletics in that was marred by the Loma Prieta Earthquake, and another seven-game loss to the Anaheim Angels in after being eight outs away from the title in Game 6. Their last postseason appearance was in 2003, when they lost to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins in the NLDS.
Most mainstream sociological perspectives are realist in orientation, building explanations around concrete actors and particular interests. By contrast, the Meyerian perspective is phenomenologically oriented. It stresses the dependence of local social organization on institutionalized models and definitions, promulgated by professionals and associations to promote collective goods. The dependence involved is more than causal influence. In the Meyerian view, institutional environments "constitute" local structures – establishing and defining their core entities, purposes, and interrelationships. Enacted models thus are often decoupled from local circumstances.

In some cases, the production studio can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as home media sales and rentals, television broadcast rights, licensing rights, or from selling distribution rights and covering costs before it is released, so a box office bomb can still break even after its theatrical run. This list includes a chart of films that failed to recover their production costs on their theatrical run from worldwide box office revenue, ranked by the nominal value of their losses.
