Papilio demoleus is a common and widespread swallowtail butterfly. It gets its common names from its host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most swallowtail butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly has also been referred to as the "Butterfly of Death", a name it shares with a morphologically similar species, "Papilio demodocus", which flies in Africa. The butterfly is a pest and invasive species from the Old World which has spread to the Caribbean and Central America.
