It was at this conference that the Society successfully began the process of bridging the gap between the medical field and the creative arts, which is one of the aims of the Society.

Middle Lake Trail is in the northwestern Sawatch Range, part of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. state of Colorado. It is located in the Holy Cross Wilderness northeast of New York Mountain in Eagle County. Middle Lake Trail is south of Interstate 70, near Eagle and Edwards. Middle Lake Trail is accessible by hiking south along the Dead Dog Trail from West Lake Creek Road south of Edwards. Dead Dog Trail crosses a ridge and ascends to a junction with the Middle Lake Trail that is 3.3 miles from Dead Dog trailhead, at 11,250 feet. Middle Lake Trail continues east to the top of the ridge, at 11,770 feet, overlooking East Lake Creek Valley. Then, Middle Lake Trail drops off the ridge to Middle Lake. Hiking Colorado: Holy Cross Wilderness, a hiking guide by Kim Fenske, provides a description of Middle Lake Trail access from Dead Dog Trail.
