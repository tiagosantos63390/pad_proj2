Symbatios was the eldest son of Leo and his wife, Theodosia. As he was a child at the time of his father's accession, he was born sometime between 800 and 810. The previous emperor, Michael I Rhangabes (r. 811–813), was likely the boy's godfather. After Leo deposed Michael I and ascended the throne on Christmas 813, he had the young Symbatios crowned co-emperor and renamed Constantine. The latter name was not chosen randomly: aside from it being a traditional Byzantine imperial name, the assembled troops now publicly acclaimed the emperors "Leo and Constantine", evoking openly the iconoclast emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) and his son Constantine V (r. 741–775). This was a clear statement of intent, not only against external foes like the Bulgars, whom Constantine V had repeatedly defeated, but also in the internal front, presaging Leo's re-adoption of iconoclasm as official state policy.
