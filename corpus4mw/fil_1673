As has been mentioned previously, the quotation "EUR/USD 1.2500" means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 US dollars. If the quote changes from EUR/USD 1.2500 to 1.2510, the euro has increased in relative value, because either the dollar buying strength has weakened or the euro has strengthened, or both. On the other hand, if the EUR/USD quote changes from 1.2500 to 1.2490 the euro is relatively weaker than the dollar.

The resulting fragmentation has restricted species dispersal as it depends on continuous canopy cover to move from tree to tree.
