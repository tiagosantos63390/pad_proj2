"Revolver's" Jon Wiederhorn, pointed out that although the songs were arranged and recorded quickly, "Inflikted" sounds neither hastily executed nor incomplete. There's a connection between Max's riffing and Igor's drumming; a chemistry that comes only from musicians who learned to play together and honed their craft through years of studio sessions and live shows. Wiederhorn described "Inflikted" as an "explosive flashback to the remorseless thrash and primal groove-metal Sepultura created between 1991's "Arise" and 1993's "Chaos A.D." [...] The songs are raw and simple, yet graced with syncopated drum runs, experimental guitar flourishes, and sonic frills inspired by Max's love of reggae and Igor's fascination with DJ culture. The vocals are primal and savage, emboldened by a sense of urgency that's equal parts desperation, rage, and celebration."
