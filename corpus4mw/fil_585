Kingston was born and raised in Epsom, Surrey, the eldest of three daughters of an English butcher, Anthony Kingston, and his German wife, Margarethe (née Renneisen). Kingston's paternal great-great-grandmother was Jewish. Kingston's uncle, her mother's younger brother, is actor Walter Renneisen. Her sisters are Susie, who is mentally and physically disabled as a result of being deprived of oxygen at birth, and Nicola, a former actress who appeared in the 1996 British TV production of "The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders", in which Kingston starred.

This is the lowest pass of the whole Peruvian Andes to arrive to the Pan-American road system.
