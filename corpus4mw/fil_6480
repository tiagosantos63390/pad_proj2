Pye allowed his neighbours the Grahams to use 23 hectares of land he owned, valued at 21 million pounds sterling, under a grazing agreement. The document expressly stated that the agreement would end on the 31 December 1983 and that to continue the arrangement a new contract would need to be entered into. Pye did not enter into another agreement because he wanted to develop the land but the Grahams continued to occupy the land. After 12 years the Grahams sought to obtain it under the English law of adverse possession.
According to Samvel Karapetyan, a prominent Armenian researcher of Armenian architecture, the church was systematically appropriated by the Georgian Orthodox Church shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. The appropriation meant the removal of all traces of the Armenian history of the church: The metal Armenian ornamental crosses remained intact on the church's two cupolas until 1990; In April 1990, the crosses that were seen as "Armenian" were removed; In Marchâ€“April 1990, the church's main altar and another smaller altar used for baptism were destroyed; A khachkar with an inscription that was part of an interior wall was removed sometime between 1990 and 1991; Also, the Armenian inscription on the wall of the northern entrance that attests to the 1753 construction of the church disappeared in 1990.
