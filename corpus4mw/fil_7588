During the Directorship of Professor Frank Wilson (1950–1959) a full department range was established at the Eastman, including children’s, oral surgery, radiography and prosthetics. The Directorship of Sir Robert Bradlaw (1959–1970) saw the Eastman’s teaching concept altered, with MSc courses of the University of London being introduced. In 1988 the Eastman moved to the old Royal Free buildings on Gray's Inn Road and in 1992 the Eastman's name was changed to the Eastman Dental Institute (EDI).

It lies on the Huisgill Burn just north of the settlement of Talisker (which gives its name to Talisker whisky) in Glen Oraid. There is another unnamed waterfall higher up the valley underneath the heights of Beinn nan Dubh-locahn ("the hill of the black loch").
