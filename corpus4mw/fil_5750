Impiety was originally formed in January 1990 by guitarist/bassist/vocalist Shyaithan (real name Mohammed Ariffeen Khuttubudeen) and drummer Necro-Angelfornicator, originally heavily influenced by the likes of Venom, Hellhammer, Sarcófago, Possessed, Destruction, Bathory and early Morbid Angel. The two recorded a rehearsal demo/promo in early 1991, but this was never officially released. After a few line-up changes, the band (now consisting of Shyaithan with guitarist Xxxul and drummer Iblyss) recorded its first official demo, in the form of 1992's "Ceremonial Necrochrist Redesecration", which made a name for the band amongst underground tape-traders. Xxxul left Impiety in 1993, to be replaced by Iblyss' brother Leprophiliac Rex on guitars. This new trio signed to Shivadarshana Records, and recorded their first 7" single, "Salve the Goat... Iblis Excelsi" in 1993, which proved to be a great improvement in both sound and execution; the single was later licensed to the American label Fudgeworthy, who pressed it onto marbel vinyl.

Studies on the binding mechanism of selective COX-2 inhibitors show that they have two reversible steps with both COX-1 and COX-2, but the selectivity for COX-2 is due to another step that is slow and irreversible and is seen only in the inhibition of COX-2, not COX-1. The irreversible step has been attributed to the presence of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) that fits into the side-pocket of COX-2. This has been studied using SC-58125 (an analogue of celecoxib) and mutated COX-2, wherein the valine 523 residue was replaced by isoleucine 523. The irreversible inhibition did not happen, but reversible inhibition was noticed. A model has been made to explain this three-step mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The first step accounts for the contact of the inhibitor with the gate of the hydrophobic channel (called the lobby region). The second step could account for the movement of the inhibitor from the lobby region to the active site of the COX enzyme. The last step probably represents repositioning of the inhibitor at the active site, which leads to strong interactions of the phenylsulfonamide or phenylsulfone group of the inhibitor and the amino acids of the side pocket. It is directly inhibition to postaglanding

Shaurya can reach a velocity of Mach 7.5 even at low altitudes. On November 12, 2008, the missile reached a velocity of Mach 5 as it crossed a distance of 300 km, with a surface temperature of 700° Celsius. The missile performed rolls to spread the heat uniformly on its surface. Flight time is between 500 seconds and 700 seconds. It has been described as a complex system with high-performance navigation and guidance systems, efficient propulsion systems, state-of-the-art control technologies and canisterised launch. It can be easily transported by road and launched by TEL. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver’s cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This “single vehicle solution” reduces its signature – it cannot be easily detected by satellites – and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister, fires for about a second and a half. It produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube. The missile has six motors; the first one is the motor in the gas generator. The centerpiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer. The ring laser gyroscope was tested and integrated by the Research Center Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad.

The presence of the electron-electron interaction term 1/r12 makes this equation non separable. This means that formula_11 cannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions and the wave function is entangled. Therefore, measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other. Nevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree–Fock and Thomas–Fermi approximations.

Kerin was first elected as the member for the new rural seat of Frome at the 1993 state election. From 1995 he held various ministries in the Brown and Olsen Liberal governments until he became Premier of South Australia in October 2001, before losing government to the Mike Rann-led Labor Party at the March 2002 state election. When the party went into opposition, Kerin remained Liberal leader until after the 2006 state election when he resigned the leadership to make way for Iain Evans.
