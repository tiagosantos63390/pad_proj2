Often called "the green town", this town enjoys thermal activity and quite a few greenhouses have been built here. Since 1933 it has supplied the capital area with natural hot water for house heating, swimming pools etc. The mountainous area around the town is ideal for walks and hikes, skiing and fishing for trout and char in the small lakes.The Nobel Prize laureate for literature in 1955, Halldór Laxness (1902–1998), was an honorary citizen of the town. He lived there all his life and based some of his novels on his experiences and impressions of his surroundings.
Beknazarov remained an implacable political enemy of Akayev. In the wake of the March 2005 Tulip Revolution which sent Akayev into exile in Russia, he was appointed Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyz Republic and waged a determined campaign against Akayev and his family, seeking the return of much of the fortune amassed by the former president's family and a repeal of Akayev's immunity for life. He resigned his position in September 2005 under a cloud of suspicion concerning alleged secret deals of money for premature closure of investigations into other misdeeds.
Their Chinese titles were identical: "Wáng" (Chinese: ), the same title borne by the "emperors" of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and by the "kings" of the Warring States. However, the custom in English is to translate the Chinese distinction between the "wangs" of the Han clan and those of other dynasties by calling the former "princes" and the latter "kings".

In mathematics, a triangulated category is a category together with additional structure, a "translation functor" and a class of "distinguished triangles". Prominent examples are the derived category of an abelian category (more generally, the homotopy category of a stable ∞-category) and the stable homotopy category of spectra, both of which carry the structure of a triangulated category in a natural fashion. The distinguished triangles are reminiscent of the long exact sequences of homology; they play a role akin to that of short exact sequences in abelian categories.
Following his retirement, Flaherty joined the YES Network as a color analyst on Yankees telecasts. In addition to game commentary, Flaherty has also served the network as an analyst on the "New York Yankees Pre-Game Show", "Yankees Batting Practice Today", and the "New York Yankees Post-Game Show". He has also appeared on the network's youth-oriented show Yankees on Deck.
The show parodied many aspects of British football in the late 1980s, such as the increasing presence of mass commercialisation, intrusive and rarely accurate media, and fan violence. The script also made frequent use of Ricky Lenin's attempts to fit in with what he saw as a 'western lifestyle', in a similar way to some of Sayle's appearances as the Balowski Family in "The Young Ones". Situations included the trouble caused by the ghost-writing of Ricky's column in "The Daily Tits" (parodying "The Sun") - a complicated argument in favour of collectivism in Lenin's original was transformed to "I hate all paddies, but I wouldn't mind giving that Gloria Hunniford one" in the paper; the North-South economic divide in England ("In Crunchthorpe there's a hundred and three per cent unemployment. The Government uses the place to dump nuclear waste! They pile it up in the town centre, outside Freeman Hardy and Willis") and films "The Titfield Thunderbolt" and "Apocalypse Now". A knowledge of football was useful for the appreciation of the series, but not essential. The script took great delight in the violent nature of professional football at the time:
Van der Waals strain, or steric strain, occurs when nonbonded atoms are forced closer to each other than their Van der Waals radii allow. Specifically, Van der Waals strain is considered a form of strain where the interacting atoms are at least four bonds away from each other. The amount on steric strain in similar molecules is dependent on the size of the interacting groups; bulky tert-butyl groups take up much more space than methyl groups and often experience greater steric interactions.

Unfortunately, the March 2013 hit "Blurred Lines" by Thicke, Williams and song co-writer Clifford "T.I." Harris Jr. came across a lawsuit for copying the 1977's "Got to to Give It Up" song. Robin Thicke originally told the public both he and Pharrell were in the recording studio and suddenly Thicke told Pharrell "'Damn, we should make something like that, something with that groove" and they wrote the song in less than an hour. However, Thicke now claims this was all a lie. In reality, Thicke now admits he did not even help write the song, but instead he took all of Pharrell's credit. In fact Thicke has stated "I was high on vicodin and alcohol when I showed up at the studio." The trial to resolve this matter is scheduled on February 10, 2015.

His next three books "Her Royal Highness Woman and his Majesty Cupid" (1901), "Between Ourselves: Some of the Little Problems of Life" (1902) "and Rambles in Womanland" (1903) are mostly reworked versions of his lectures, containing many trivial anecdotes and aphorisms on the subject of women, love and marriage. Similar to his stereotyped depictions of national character, O'Rell presented ready-made clichés of gender relations. O'Rell continued to lecture in the United States, but he had to cut short his 1900 tour due to a severe stomach complaint. His next American trip one and a half years later even ended with an appendix operation in New York.

Gonzales initially had trouble selling his product, in particular because the LAPD claimed that the "Homies" glorified gang life. Many stores stopped selling the Homies. Met with the challenge of re-creating his characters to ensure that the product would sell well during a comeback, Gonzales went back to the drawing board and gave the "Homies" a new life when he gave each individual character a biography as a well to do person.

In order to be able to admit all children to the seven-year schools outlined in 1948, a campaign to expand the school network was undertaken. So many new schools were built (4,834 new classrooms in 1956 alone) that the government could, and indeed did, pass a law mandating the maximum distance between a child's home and their school. For students in grades one to four a school had to be within 3 kilometers of their home, and for students in grades five to seven, within 4 kilometers of their home.

"Sangay's" first stop was at Funafuti from 29 November 1943 to 11 January 1944 where, in addition to issuing ammunition to cruisers and destroyers, her crew cleared obstructions in the Te Bua Bua Channel and directed minesweeping operations in the harbor. After resupplying at Pearl Harbor, the ammunition ship moved to the Marshall Islands and issued bombs and fuses to the carriers of Task Force 58 at Majuro from 6 to 9 February, and then transferred the rest of her cargo to barges at Roi between 10 and 14 February and to USS "Rainier" (AE-5) at Majuro from 17 to 22 February.

On 17 May Hudson resigned from the YNMR to avoid sacking and a committee was set up to look at the allegation that Hudson had used their money to build a private station at Londesborough Park on the Market Weighton line. As 1849 progressed more was unearthed and by the autumn Hudson was being asked to repay £750,000. He sold Londesborough Park and then paid £200,000 off to the YNBR (chairman George Leeman) rather than face being taken to court.

According to researchers the ethnic Lotud were synonymous with the word 'Suang Lotud' and can be found in 35 villages in Tuaran district. The ethnic Dusun Lotud called Lotude were based on the anecdotes not written by their ancestors. The Lotud women were known to wear skirts below the knees only. The word 'otud' in Dusun Lotud dialect means 'Lutut' or knee.

In 1619 he removed to Catharine Hall, where in 1620 he was elected fellow. At this time he was influenced by John Rogers of Dedham. Goodwin rode 35 miles from Cambridge to Dedham to hear this Puritan preacher. In 1625 he was licensed a preacher of the university; and three years afterwards he became lecturer of Trinity Church, successor to John Preston, to the vicarage of which he was presented by the king in 1632.
Before 1997 was out, Adams took his third job of the 1997–98 season when he was named manager of Brentford. The club had suffered a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two play-off final, and were struggling near the foot of the table. He signed striker Andy Scott from Sheffield United for a fee of £75,000. Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were relegated to Division Three on the last day of the season, and the club was bought out by Ron Noades, who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.

Powder Ridge might have been a legendary hippie music fest had things gone right. In the year following Woodstock, however, things often went wrong for hippie music fests, which went into “a long spiral of decline”. Thirty of the forty-eight major festivals planned for 1970 were cancelled, usually due to swiftly materializing local opposition. Powder Ridge, however, made national news because of the arrival of tens of thousands of ticketholders despite the event's cancellation. "The New York Times" followed its progress in about thirty articles before, during, and after the event.

Warrick finished his career with averages of 15.4 points on 53.6% shooting, 7.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. He finished second all-time at Syracuse in free throws made (529) and free throws attempted (803), third for consecutive double-figure scoring games (61) and fourth in points (2,073) and rebounds (1,025).
He was publicly hanged in front of 5,000 spectators on February 11, 1869 at the Carleton County Gaol. He met his death "with manliness and faith", and told the gathered crowd that he was innocent, although he did know who had killed McGee. His last words were "God save Ireland and God save my soul".
After the rest period the Division was sent again to the Western Front, being attached to XLVII Panzer Corps, 5th Panzer Army which was preparing an offensive in the area of the Ardennes, Belgium. By the start of the battle, it was well-equipped, with 103 tanks and assault guns. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 - January 1945, the 2nd Panzer Division attacked towards the crucial road junction of Bastogne. However, the town's defences was quickly reinforced by the veteran 101st Airborne Division. Various attacks directed against the town failed, and the 2nd Panzer Division had lost precious time in trying to take down Bastogne's defenders. When it was diverted to the Meuse on December 18, in accordance with the original plan, the division was unable to break reach the river. American reinforcements to the area threatened its flanks and to cut it off from its supply line. Eventually, the vanguard of the division came to reach within 4 km the Meuse River where on the 24 December they were stopped by the British 3rd Royal Tank Regiment. It was forced to retreat by fierce counterattacks conducted by American forces as well as the lack of gasoline for the German mechanized forces.

In order to promote "The Velvet Rope" and the single, Jackson performed "Together Again" at the American Music Awards of 1998. The singer has also performed the song on all of her tours since its release. She included the song on the 1998 The Velvet Rope Tour. Dressed up in "chandeliers and sensible clothing", it was performed as the closing song from the concert. Jon Pareles from "The New York Times" viewed the performance as "an elegy disguised as an arm-waving, feel-good song". The performance of the song at the October 11, 1998 show in New York City, at the Madison Square Garden, was broadcast during a special titled "The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden" by HBO. It was also added to the setlist at its DVD release, "The Velvet Rope Tour – Live in Concert" in 1999. It was again performed as the encore on the All for You Tour in support of her follow-up album "All for You" in 2001 and 2002. Gina Vivinetto from "St. Petersburg Times", while reviewing the concert, described the performance, "The show closed with a buoyant Together Again that found Jackson grinning, surrounded by dancers moving in refreshing, unscripted merriment". The February 16, 2002 final date of the tour at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, was broadcast by HBO, and included a performance of "Together Again". This rendition was also added to the setlist at its DVD release, "", in 2002. Jackson also performed it on VH1's The Concert for New York City benefit concert which paid tribute to victims of the September 11 attacks the same year.

A trademark of pluripotent stem-cells, such as embryonic stem-cells (ESCs), is the ability to self-renew indefinitely. The conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of ESCs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long-term expansion of un-differentiated ESCs challenging. Ideally, chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain ESCs in a pluripotent state indefinitely. Toward this goal, the Schultz and Ding labs at the Scripps Research Institute identified a small molecule that can preserve the long-term self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors. This novel molecule, called pluripotin, was found to simultaneously inhibit multiple differentiation inducing pathways.

Since no ideal sources of either variety exist (all real-world examples have finite and non-zero source impedance), any current source can be considered as a voltage source with the "same" source impedance and vice versa. Voltage sources and current sources are sometimes said to be duals of each other and any non ideal source can be converted from one to the other by applying Norton's or Thévenin's theorems.
This naive approach usually works best if one uses a frame field rather than a coordinate basis.
