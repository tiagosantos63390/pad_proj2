WRIP first signed on in August 1999 as the first radio station in Greene County based outside of Catskill. Initially, the station had a uniquely split format of adult contemporary weekdays and oldies weekends. Now WRIP focuses primarily on AC hits from the 80's, 90's and today. Weekday mornings were hosted by station manager Guy Patrick Garraghan until his untimely death in November 2010. Garraghan was a lifelong local resident who spent 17 years on the air at WCKL in Catskill prior to coming to WRIP in 1999. He is credited for being the primary force in bringing local radio to the mountaintop region. Current Operations Manager Joe Loverro hosts morning drive, while WRIP President and General Manager Jay Fink hosts afternoon drive.
