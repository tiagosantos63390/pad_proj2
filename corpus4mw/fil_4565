An auditor earns a living from the fee he is paid it is therefore automatic that he does not want to do anything to jeopardize this income. This reliance on clients’ fees may affect the independence of an auditor. If the auditor feels this client income is more important than their responsibilities to shareholders he may not perform the audit with the shareholder’s interests in mind. The larger the fee income the more likely the auditor is to shirk his responsibilities and perform the audit without independence. This could lead to the manipulation of figures and exploitation of accounting standards. By performing the audit without independence the shareholders’ may get misled, as the auditor is now reliant on the directors. To encourage auditors to maintain their independence they must be protected from the director’s board. If they were able to challenge statements and figures without the risk of losing their job they would be more likely to work with complete independence. Ultimately, as long as the client determines audit appointments and fees an auditor will never be able to have complete economic independence.

"I'm Your Witchdoctor" is a cover of a John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers song, which the band also performed in their early 1977/8 sets. "Instro" is the only original composition here and is a rare instrumental from the band; perhaps the lack studio time prevented them from writing lyrics and recording vocals, or maybe they deemed it unworthy of completion.

The band achieved notable popularity for its demo 98/99. It was produced and engineered by Stian Aarstad, the keyboard player of Dimmu Borgir. This caused a lot of rumors in the internet. The reason Stian wanted to mix their demo, was that he heard them at a show they played. He offered them a free session in studio, because he needed training in mixing and engineering. Their demo was finished in December 1998, and they have at this point made 1000 copies of it. It was released on cassette in Indonesia through THT Productions in the beginning of 2000.

Activating CMKLR1 by an agonist mobilizes intracellular calcium and causes the activation of several other signaling cascades like the ERK1 and NF-κB. Initial studies of CMKLR1 suggested that it might have a role in the inflammatory pathways. Its cognate ligand, chemerin was found in joint aspirate from rheumatoid arthritis and absent in aspirate from degenerative arthritis. CMKLR1 expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages also helped foster this idea. In vitro chemotaxis assays showed it to be utilized in attracting these cells. As an adipokine receptor it has a role in adipogenesis and adipocyte maturation. It seems also to have a role in peripheral insulin resistance.
