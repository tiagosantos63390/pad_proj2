A handsomely sculptured alter-tomb formerly occupied the centre of this chapel, which is now found built into the walls of the vault that surrounds the Bermingham tomb, erected in 1815 by a Frederick Hamilton. The effigy on the original tomb is now placed in an upright position within the chapel. It represents a knight in a suit of plate armour, with a crucifix on the breast attached around the neck by a chain. The effigy is more than likely dedicated to Sir William Bermingham.

The lake is a popular fishing spot partly because it is close to the St. Regis River which is stocked with over 10,000 trout each year. The lake itself harbors different species of trout including Rainbows and Browns with other fish species like perch. It can be fished year-round and there is a DEC boat launch located along the shore. The lake may only be accessed by a non-motorized boat or a motorized boat with a 10 horsepower or less engine.
