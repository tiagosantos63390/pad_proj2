The icebergs that calve from the glacier edge move towards the river mouth and get entrenched at the bottom. The movement of the icebergs fluctuates with the tide currents, as well as being affected by wind. However, they start floating as icebergs when their size is small enough to drift to the sea. These icebergs are seen in two shades: milky white and bright blue, which depends on the air trapped within the ice and is an interplay of light and ice crystals.

Chaplin departed for South Africa in the summer of 1997 to work as a volunteer during his gap year. Chaplin's early experiences there would later be reflected in the band's position for the Make Poverty History campaign. Returning a year later, in July 1998, following a meeting with friend David Lloyd Seaman, Hughes' first words when the band picked up Chaplin at the airport were, "we've got a gig in ten days."

Once Igoe has been injected, Jack and Lydia escape, steal back the chip and order everyone in the lab into the miniaturization device, including Scrimshaw and Margaret. However, not knowing how to operate it, they only manage to miniaturize everyone to 50% of the original size. Tuck, now inside Lydia, finds a growing baby and realises not only is he inside her but that she is pregnant with his child. By going to Lydia's ear drum and playing their song he is able to alert them what has happened at which point they kiss again to transfer Tuck back. After fighting their way through a couple more guards they frantically drive back to the lab in order to enlarge Tuck, not realizing that miniature versions of Scrimshaw and Margaret are hiding in the back seat and trying to make them crash. Meanwhile, Igoe locates Tuck and attacks him, but Tuck disables Igoe's craft, and when he abandons it and clings to the pod, Tuck kills him by dropping him into Jack's stomach, where Mr. Igoe is digested.
