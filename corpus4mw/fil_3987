Because every time there is an increase in blood volume (created by the release of erythrocytes), there is an increase in pressure, the two are said to have a direct relationship. Thus, if one increases, so will the other. As well as blood volume, another factor affecting pressure is the temperature in which the newts are. At lower temperatures, a lower pressure will be expressed, and the opposite is true for a higher temperature. The relationship between pressure and the congestion of the spleen is inverted. When congestion of the spleen rises, the pressure will fall; and vice versa.
