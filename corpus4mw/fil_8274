The cypress darter can be found across the Gulf Coastal plain of southern North America, in regions from the Colorado River of eastern Texas through the Choctawhatchee River of eastern Alabama, north to the Fall Line, and upstream along the Arkansas River valley in eastern Oklahoma. They prefer living in vegetated margins of swamps and lakes and slow-moving streams with silt or sand bottoms and leaf-laden water. It inhabits backwater habitats during the summer; in winter, flooded riffles and backwater bayous, and lowland lakes are ideal macrohabitats for the cypress darter. For example, in Texas, it can be found in streams limited to the extreme east, including the Red River, Sabine Lake, Galveston Bay, and thr Colorado River. No current information points to the decrease in any population of the cypress darter across the southeast.

Glenn's approach to garden design is characterised as fluid by some references. The highly regarded Australian gardening writer Michael Mc Coy cites an instance in which Glenn confessed his frustration with garden writers, "that built whole articles around ideas they’d had for planting combinations, when it was his experience...that most ideas don’t work, or need very substantial fine-tuning or reconfiguring before they can be made to work. At very best they lead to an idea that does work".
