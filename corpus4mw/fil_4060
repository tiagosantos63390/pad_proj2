Painted tiger parrot
The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms "tricho-" "hair", and "gl√µssa" "tongue". There are uncertainties in the classification. The main uncertainty is the delineation of the species "Trichoglossus haematodus", which has until now been broadly defined with many subspecies. However several are found in remote areas and have been little studied, with some arguing for their classification as separate species. Furthermore, the three species of the related genus "Psitteuteles" have been sometimes classified as members of "Trichoglossus".
