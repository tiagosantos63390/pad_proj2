The sequence for Plastoglobulin-1 has been elucidated in Pisum sativum (garden pea); it was found to be synthesised as a 358 residue pro-peptide, containing a 47 residue transit peptide for localisation to the chloroplast; the transit peptide is cleaved to produce the mature plastoglobulin. Plastoglobulin are known to interact with each other to form a coat on lipid globules, that either recruits or maintain receptors for attachment to the thylakoid membrane, or for transport of lipids across the thylakoid membrane.

The First Army planned to attack in the first half of July, as part of an attempt by the First and Second armies to keep German troops away from the Flanders front for as long as possible, with feint attacks on Lens and Lille. The dispatch of heavy and siege artillery to Flanders, led the First Army commander General Horne, to bring forward the attack to 28 June and to limit the attack to the XIII Corps operation against Oppy and Gavrelle. Artillery moving north to Flanders from the Third Army, was diverted temporarily to increase the weight of the First Army bombardment, which was to take place on a front, to create the impression of an imminent threat against Lens. XIII Corps had four divisions, with the 31st and 63rd divisions alternating in the line on the right and the 2nd Division and 5th Division alternating on the left flank. The 5th Division withdrew the 15th Brigade for a week of training for the attack, which was conducted by all four battalions. The plan required the artillery to cut the German wire but leave the German trenches intact, so that the British infantry could occupy them.
