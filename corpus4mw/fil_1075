In the newly created British province of Northern Ireland, the unionists of the Ulster Unionist Party continued to dominate domestic politics.

The Armenians sent a delegation led by Mkrtich Khrimian to the 1878 Congress of Berlin to lobby the European powers to include proper safeguards for their kinsmen in the eventual peace agreement.
