With Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) now awake, Old Nan (Margaret John) tells him a tale of a long-ago endless winter, when the White Walkers first appeared riding their dead horses and raising Wights from the men they slaughtered. Her story is interrupted by Robb (Richard Madden) who sadly confirms to Bran that his injuries are permanent, and he'll never walk again. Bran, saying he is unable to remember anything about his fall, wishes he was dead.

After returning to Australia and recuperating from his wounds, he travelled to remote Cape York, and worked with pearlers and missionaries in the Torres Strait islands and Papua New Guinea where he worked as a gold miner. Other ventures included buffalo shooting in the Northern Territory, and journeys to Central and Western Australia.
