Schedules can usefully span both short periods, such as a daily or weekly schedule, and long-term planning with respect to periods of several months or years. They are often made using a calendar, where the person making the schedule can note the dates and times at which various events are planned to occur. Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list algorithmically an expected order in which events either can or must take place.


In February 2011, the Hoover City school board approved a realignment plan that affected schools across the system. One change made involves freshmen being brought back into the senior campus, with a freshman-specific wing to be completed by the end of the 2011-2012 school year. This date has been moved to February of 2013. Seventh- and eighth-grade students at Bumpus Middle School were moved into the building that housed the freshmen, with fifth- and sixth-grade students attending Brock's Gap Intermediate School, the former Bumpus Middle School building.

The Wood Wife by Terri Windling was published by Tor Books in 1996, and won the Mythopoeic Award for Novel of the Year. Set in the mountain outskirts of contemporary Tucson, Arizona, the novel could equally be described as magical realism, contemporary fantasy, or mythic fiction. Windling draws on myth, folklore, poetry, and the history of surrealist art to tell the story of a woman who finds her muse in a spirited desert landscape. The plot revolves around a reclusive English poet, Davis Cooper, and his lover, Mexican surrealist painter Anna Naverra -- a character remininscent of the real-life Mexican painter Remedios Varo.
