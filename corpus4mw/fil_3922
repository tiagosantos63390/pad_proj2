By first mapping into one or more PDH tributaries such as T1, E1, or DS3, the component Ethernet contained in separate PDH signals from a central location can be fanned out to multiple locations. EoPoS allows transport of native Ethernet frames over a SONET/SDH network. Then the component PDH can then be separately dropped using a legacy add-drop multiplexer. Finally, the PDH links are resolved back to Ethernet connections by equipment supporting EoPDH. For proper operation each of the virtual local area network must be individually tagged using IEEE 802.1Q for example.
