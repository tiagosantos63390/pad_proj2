Buformin, along with phenformin and metformin, inhibits the growth and development of cancer. The anticancer property of these drugs is due to their ability to disrupt the Warburg effect and revert the cytosolic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells to normal oxidation of pyruvate by the mitochondria.
