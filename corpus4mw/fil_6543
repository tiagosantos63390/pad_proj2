AP carried a set number of strips, so a new strip was not added until one was dropped. When the "Oaky Doaks" daily debuted on June 17, 1935, it replaced Harold Detje's "Be Scientific with Ol' Doc Dabble" which ran from June 6, 1932 until June 15, 1935. In a similar fashion, when Milton Caniff learned of an opening while he was working on AP spot illustrations, he spent the weekend drawing samples, and Caniff's strip career was launched when his "Dickie Dare" began in 1933. The following year, "Dickie Dare" was taken over by Coulton Waugh.

We thank God for the prosperity we have had; that repeatedly in one section and another we found openings. Today we have something like forty churches, and it is wonderful how the Lord has blessed us. Sometimes it seems that there were periods when things were against us, but we have stood the storm, and come out the stronger... We have put more members in other churches than we have taken out. We are not sore or fighting. We are just pushing, that is all. We desire to have a heart as big as the world is round.
