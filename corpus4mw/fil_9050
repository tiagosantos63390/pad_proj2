A 12 year-old girl named Chloe Croombe (Nell Tiger Free) is on the bus on the way to school. Her nemesis Pippa (Jemma Donovan) throws a banana skin on a tramp called Mr. Stink (Hugh Bonneville) sitting on a bench with his dog the Duchess (Pudsey). She goes to see Mr. Stink, who asks sausages for the Duchess. The following morning, she takes sausages to give them to Mr. Stink. Chloe's mother Caroline Croombe (Sheridan Smith) is a candidate to be local MP. She rips up Chloe's story that she wrote. Chloe and Mr. Stink enter Starbucks, where everyone runs away due to Mr. Stink's odour.
