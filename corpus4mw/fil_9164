Trolleybuses have provided regular public transport service in 27 different cities in China at one time or another. Currently, ten systems are in operation, and they include Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao and Jinan, among other locations. Shanghai's system is the oldest trolleybus system in the world, having been in operation since November 1914. Beijing's trolleybus system, the most extensive in China, is served by trolleybuses that can run for considerable distances on battery power. In Shanghai, new battery-only buses have been ordered to replace certain trolleybus routes. These buses charge at terminals and stops and operate from the electric power stored in supercapacitors. China also has a few very small trolleybus systems located away from urban areas, at coal mines, with trolleybuses used for transporting of workers between the mines and the workers' housing areas. One such line is at the Wuyang Coal Mine, located near Changzhi, in Shanxi province, which opened in 1985 and, as of 2010, had a fleet of 10 articulated trolleybuses.
