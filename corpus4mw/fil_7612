In the Spring of 2011, BSP launched its "Research Israel" Project, a research initiative undertaken with New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. The first part of this project will be the documentation of NOBTS's Tel Gezer expedition in the June, 2011. BSP and NOBTS will work closely with the Israeli Nature and Parks Authority as well as the Israeli Antiquities Authority to explore an early Canaanite water shaft that first excavated by R.A. McAlister. BSP will publish the findings of this expedition in a volume due in the winter 2011/2012.

Constraints typically come in batches and can be quantified with the codice_9 operator. For instance, instead of listing all countries and their neighbors explicitly in the source code, one may have an array of countries, an array of decision variables representing the color of each country, and an array codice_10 or a predicate (a boolean function) codice_11.
