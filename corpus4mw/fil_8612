Goldsmith serves on the original Free Zone Committee in Boulder and acts as its moral compass. Upon her union with Redman, Lauder becomes jealous, but later appears to have dealt with his jealous emotions. However, Goldsmith remains suspicious of Lauder and this is later justified when she finds details of a plot to kill Redman in Lauder's diary (with the use of a bomb). Goldsmith saves the majority of the committee when she intuitively senses the presence of the planted bomb. Goldsmith is moderately injured in the blast, but her unborn child remains safe. Goldsmith is opposed to Redman traveling west, but comes to terms with the journey when she realizes that Redman is compelled to follow through with the trip. Goldsmith later takes up residence with Lucy Swann and delivers a baby boy. Although initial joy is experienced due to the birth, Goldsmith's child falls ill with the superflu and Goldsmith is devastated. However, she is rewarded by news of both Redman's return to the Free Zone and her baby’s recovery. Throughout the novel, Goldsmith becomes more and more homesick for her native Maine, and, at the end of the book she, Redman, and the baby return to the East coast; the last chapter also confirms that Goldsmith has become pregnant, with Redman as the father.
