On election night the results showed a hotly contested race between Hinman and Roberts with Hinman coming out on top by a margin of nearly 300 votes. The result was a bitter disappointment for David Swann and the Liberals and would eventually lead him to resign as leader of the Liberal party. The Progressive Conservatives finished a distant third for the first time in the riding since 1967 and lost control of the seat they had held since 1969. The bottom three candidates barely registered with voters. The NDP result was the worst ever result in a Calgary riding since the party was formed and the Social Credit vote continued to decline falling below a percent.

One of the most significant rites performed is the carrying of the kavadi, a large wooden decorated arch, as an act of penance. When deities are taken on procession from one shrine to another, they would be followed by a number of these voluntary kavadi-bearers. In other towns and estates, kavadis would be carried for other festivals like "Chittirai Paruvam". Some of the more rigid practitioners would bear spikes, spears, and hooks pierced into their bodies. The "Chittirai Paruvam" festival and festivals to the Tamil deity Mariamman are usually accompanied by a fire-walking ceremony.

In 1925, the designation changed once again. Now the largest cutters were known as "Cruising Cutters, First Class," while the coastal cutters were "Cruising Cutters, Second Class." With Prohibition enforcement becoming a major mission, the US Coast Guard began adding numerous smaller patrol craft and these were grouped together under the classification of "Patrol Boats." The service also acquired a large number of US Navy destroyers to augment the fleet and these were known as, simply, "Coast Guard Destroyers."

A player will start the game with the default golf club. As the player progresses, they are given the option to purchase new clubs, using either Pang or Cookies (Points in the North America server).

Speaking in 2008, producer Mike Stock explained: 'Des Dyer was brought in to assist with the Jerome part - because his voice and Jerome's were similar...The Robson part was done by a totally different singer and the high note was a totally different guy.' Stock placed a gagging order on singer Des Dyer after he threatened to reveal this to a newspaper.

Frenetic is a domain-specific language for programming software-defined networks (SDNs). A domain-specific programming language allows network operators, rather than manually configuring each connected network device, to program the network as a whole. Frenetic is designed to solve major OpenFlow/NOX programming problems. In particular, Frenetic introduces a set of purely functional abstractions that enable modular program development, defines high-level, programmer-centric packet-processing operators, and eliminates many of the difficulties of the two-tier programming model by introducing a see-every-packet programming paradigm. Hence Frenetic is a functional reactive programming language operating at a packet level of abstraction.
