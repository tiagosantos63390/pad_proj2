You Wanted the Best, You Got the Best!! is a live hits album released by American hard rock band Kiss. The album was issued to coincide with the group's 1996–97 Alive/Worldwide Tour. All of the songs on the album are live versions. Most were taken from "Alive!" or "Alive II" but four recordings had been previously unreleased. The liner notes report the tracks are outtakes from Alive! and Alive II-era recordings, although there is some speculation to whether or not this is actually the case; in an interview with Latent Image magazine in 1998, Bruce Kulick stated that he had participated in some aspects of this album in the studio, although he did not comment on the extent of his involvement. The final track is an interview of the reunited group conducted by Jay Leno.

Writings.
In an attempt to revive Wittgenstein to his superior state, Radio and Ratso go to the college's storage building to find the hard-to-find WFC 11-12-55 tube. When they come back with the last apparent tube for miles, however, Radio and Ratso (after an argument with the tube) accidentally break it, and it seems that all hope is lost. Wittgenstein does his best with all his might, but he blows his remaining tube with a big explosion and apparently "is a goner". Ratso then blames Radio, which causes Radio himself to give up his own tube which turns out to be the very rare tube they had been looking for, thus leaving himself as a lifeless appliance. Apparently, knowing that they were given a final chance to save the animals, the appliances replaced the tube in the nick of time; with the boosted power of the new tube, Wittgenstein wakes up, miraculously regenerates the other smashed tubes connected to himself and destroying the computer viruses within him and is completely revived to as good as new. By the end of the film, the appliances restore Rob's thesis and stop Mack from selling the injured animals, Radio's tube is replaced with a new one (hence his revival), Wittgenstein is sold to a museum, Rob proposes to his girlfriend Chris, and all is well.
By the end of the sixth day of the July tournament he had achieved 4 wins and 2 losses. On the seventh day following a loss to Chiyotaikai, the two glared at each other and exchanged angry words. He later smashed a glass door of the bathroom and received a strong warning, but later assaulted two cameramen and was punished by suspension for three days. He returned on the 11th day to beat Kotoshōgiku, and went on to achieve a satisfactory 8-5-2 record for the tournament. In the next tournament, as M1, he achieved a good result of 10-5, returning to "komusubi" for November. Unusually, there were four "komusubi" in that tournament, as Aminishiki had achieved 11 wins in September, and Kisenosato and Kokkai had both achieved kachi-koshi.
