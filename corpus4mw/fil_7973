Almaluu () is a village in the Kemin District of Chuy Province of Kyrgyzstan.
Like "Atta", "Acromyrmex" subsists mostly on a particular species of fungus (genus "Leucocoprinus") which it cultivates on a medium of masticated leaf tissue. This is the sole food of the queen and other colony members that remain in the nest. The media workers also gain subsistence from plant sap they ingest whilst physically cutting out sections of leaf from a variety of plants.
"The Gunstringer" was distributed with a code to download an Xbox Live Arcade Kinect title, "Fruit Ninja Kinect". A free downloadable content addon was also released, entitled "Wavy Tube Man Chronicles". Instead of the hybrid computer generated/live action presentation of the main game, this add on is Troma's live action FMV rail shooter in the vein of laserdisc games like Mad Dog McCree. The soundtrack was also made available at no charge via the game's official website.
