Its acquisitions included S&W Fine Foods, TreeSweet, White Rose, Serv-A-Portion (distributor of condiment packets for fast food), Los Angeles Drugs, Peter Carando Inc (Italian-style meats), Sun Aire Airlines and Las Plumas Lumber Co. DiGiorgio also became invested in land development across California. Boston based investment groups and directorship gave the company close ties to Bank of America (then Bank of Italy), Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison.
