In Australia, the Water Accounting Standards Board has released standards for producing general purpose water accounting reports. These standards are designed to complement the SEEA-Water, but to support the preparation of reports for a wider audience than statisticians and economists. The development of these type of standards is continuing. 
In 1870 alone, Perris staged the robberies of the Philadelphia Navy Yard and the Grafton National Bank in Worcester, Massachusetts; he and an accomplice escaped with $180,000 in the latter robbery. Perris was caught by police after the Grafton bank job, however, he escaped custody on April 5, 1872. He broke out of the Worcester jailhouse by forcing open the bars of a fourth story window in the north end of the building, with the help of a jackscrew smuggled in from the outside, and climbed outside using a rope. He remained at large for at least 15 years in spite of a $3,000 reward offered by county commissioners for his capture. One of the reasons he was able to evade arrest was wearing a beard, and regularly changing its style, as the few pictures Perris showed him clean-shaven; he was always "smooth-faced" part of the time. The only identifying marks were a "prominent" dimple on his chin and a scar from a pistol-shot on his right eyebrow.
