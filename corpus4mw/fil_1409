The Australian wood frog (Hylarana daemeli), locally simply known as the wood frog, is the only species from the family Ranidae found in Australia. The species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland, the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and much of New Guinea. Long placed in the "wastebin genus" "Rana", it is now in "Hylarana" together with such species as the common green frog of Southeast Asia.
