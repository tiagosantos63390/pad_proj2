The original tower house has been much extended and modernized, and is now more of a mansion than a castle. 
In reflection seismology, the anelastic attenuation factor, often expressed as seismic quality factor or Q (which is inversely proportional to attenuation factor), quantifies the effects of anelastic attenuation on the seismic wavelet caused by fluid movement and grain boundary friction. As a seismic wave propagates through a medium, the elastic energy associated with the wave is gradually absorbed by the medium, eventually ending up as heat energy. This is known as absorption (or anelastic attenuation) and will eventually cause the total disappearance of the seismic wave.
Glass noted that amenities where limited, but said that he had everything he needed. He found the food at Hi Tide to be "good", and the food at the resorts informal bar "even better."
