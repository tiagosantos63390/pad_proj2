The high rainfall caused many rivers to rise above their banks across Virginia, becoming among the top three highest crests on record along several rivers in the state. The flood set the highest river stage on record along the Roanoke River at Roanoke, Tinker Creek near Daleville, the Calfpasture River at Goshen, the Craig Creek at Parr, and the James River at Buchanan, Holcomb Rock, and Bent Creek. At Holcomb Rock, the James River crested at , the highest in the state, and was about above flood stage; based on the observations and the associated discharge, the return period was estimated as greater than a 1 in 500 year event. River gauges recorded record discharge rates at 34 stations, of which 32 were 100 year events. The rains delayed crops from being planted across the state and caused minor crop damage. Across the state, about 3,500 houses were destroyed. Overall, the storm system caused 22 deaths and $753 million, greater than the devastating hurricanes Camille and Agnes, and making it the costliest flood in the state's history.
