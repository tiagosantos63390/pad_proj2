While claiming a superior method, Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but in 1837 he felt the need to reply to a published letter written in support of Nicholson by fellow engineer Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for Northumberland. Unfortunately the three men became involved in a paper war that, following a number of earlier altercations in which the originality of his writings was questioned, left the 71-year old Nicholson feeling bitter and unappreciated.
A PTO is not the same as Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). They are similar in that both promote parent participation, but PTA takes a more active role in developing programs, advocacy and training. PTA operates at the school building, district, state and national levels and works on policy to better support children. Local PTA units set their own goals and missions, but they also join together to advocate and partner as a larger group. PTA is membership based and uses money from dues to offer staff support and grants, and to develop national programs, such as their Reflections arts in education program and their Standards for Family-School Partnerships implementation guide. A PTO is unaffiliated, local and does not pay dues to a national umbrella organization.

The "Queen Louise League" or Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund, was a German pro-monarchic women's organization. It was established in 1923 during the time of the Weimar Republic and lasted until the first years of the Third Reich. This organization was inspired on the figure of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of Prussia, held in reverence by many Germans of the time. The Bund Königin Luise had also a children branch known as Kinderkreis (Children Circle).
He was first elected in 2008. He was unseated by Republican Pat Mazorol in the 2010 general election. In 2012 he won his seat back against Terry Jacobson.
Predictions.
Critics of Celente have accused him of claiming successful predictions based on vague language and "operating on his hunches." Critics have argued, for example, that while he claims to have correctly predicted everything from the fall of the Soviet Union to impending recessions, an empirical review suggests that overall his predictions are frequently wrong, citing predictions of everything from the resignation of Ronald Reagan to a 2012 "Economic 9/11" that he predicted would be equal to or worse than the Great Depression, marked by "food riots, squatter rebellions, tax revolts and job marches."

1990–91 was the Oberliga Berlin's last season, the German reunion also affected football and the NOFV-Oberliga was established instead. "Hertha" became part of the NOFV-Oberliga Mitte, a league dominated by 1. FC Union Berlin in its short three year existence and Zehlendorf managed only average performances. Nevertheless, it did qualify for the new tier-three Regionalliga Nordost in 1994. In a league full of former East German football powerhouses, the team struggled for four seasons before being relegated in 1998.
