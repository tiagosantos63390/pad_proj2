The piece was commissioned by the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Skempton was to write a piece to be performed between the Prelude from Richard Wagner's "Parsifal" and a Deryck Cooke completion of Gustav Mahler's Tenth Symphony. Skempton initially set out to compose three short pieces to be played in sequence, but afterwards decided on a single large piece. "Lento" was completed in November 1990; it was premiered on 12 March 1991 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican Centre concert hall, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth.
