Gopher is a fictional grey anthropomorphic gopher, character who first appeared in the 1966 Disney animated film "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree", introducing himself as Samuel J. Gopher. He has a habit of whistling out his sibilant consonants, one of various traits he has in common with the beaver in "Lady and the Tramp", by whom he may have been inspired. Gopher was fleshed out a bit further in the television series "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh". He is portrayed as generally hard-working, especially in his tunnels (which he inevitably falls into at least once). He does not appear in the original books by A. A. Milne (a fact that is regularly pointed out in "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree", when he breaks the fourth wall by saying he's "not in the book, y'know", also trying to say that he would not be in a phone book). Gopher's voice was originally done by Howard Morris, who retired from the role and was replaced by Michael Gough.
