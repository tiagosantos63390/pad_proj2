On the other hand, Ghossein stayed in Beirut and graduated from Saint Joseph University (USJ) with a degree in economics. Shortly after graduation, he worked in banking jobs and eventually decided to forsake his corporate attire after he met Mansour outside a famous blues bar 'Bar Louie' in Beirut while the former was embroiled in a fistfight. Having had Ghossein's back, Mansour and Ghossein built a friendship, which eventually culminated into a musical partnership that created The Wanton Bishops.

Weber Company's position against Steinway & Sons further weakened with Weber's relatively early death at the age of only 50. While Weber outlived his rival, his family was smaller and far less prolific than the Steinway family, and due to his tendency toward micro-management, Weber's death was a large loss to the company. Unlike Steinweg, Albert Weber's heir was a poor reflection of the original, and did damage to the Weber name.

In Mozambique, the RNR encountered Lettow-Vorbeck's supply column near Mtarika on 22 May 1918. It wiped it out (capturing two German officers, two German "askaris", 34 Portuguese "askaris" and 252 carriers), but as the supply column had been marching between the main German column and its rearguard, Lettow-Vorbeck was then able to attack the RNR from both sides. The contact lasted until darkness fell, and the RNR held its position. Lettow-Vorbeck then moved further south, with the RNR following. This pursuit continued for the rest of the war, with Lettow-Vorbeck avoiding contacts so far as was possible and constantly resupplying his men by briefly occupying isolated towns. The RNR chased the German column for over around Mozambique and the eastern districts of Northern Rhodesia, but never caught up with him. After Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered at Abercorn on 25 November 1918, the RNR returned to Salisbury, where the men were discharged during 1919. The regiment existed on paper for two more years before it was formally disbanded in February 1921.

Swiss Space Systems (S3) is a company which plans to provide orbital launches of small satellites and manned suborbital spaceflights. The company is based at Payerne Airport in western Switzerland, where it plans to build a spaceport in 2015. Suborbital spaceplanes will be launched from an Airbus A300, giving the spacecraft more initial speed and altitude than if it were launched from the ground. The spacecraft, in turn, will release a disposable third stage.
