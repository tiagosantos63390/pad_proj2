Watson was ordained deacon at Norwich in 1574. It is supposed that he died before 12 June 1581, when the Stationers' Company licensed to Henry Carre "a lamentation for the death of Mr. Christofer Watson, mynister".

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 95% of 21 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.1/10. Metacritic rated it 63/100 based on twelve reviews. Dennis Harvey of "Variety" wrote that the film's "trivial-sounding hook manages to float a funny but complex meditation on identity, ethnicity and cultural expectations". John Anderson of the "Los Angeles Times" called it "a journey of realization for anyone who's ever felt lost in the crowd." Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" described it as a witty autobiography that is "really about cultural assimilation and a stereotype of virtue and subservience that has deep roots on both sides of the Pacific." Noel Murray of "The A.V. Club" wrote of Lee that "her technique is pretty much everything that's wrong with documentary filmmaking today."

In 2004, after failing to secure a deal for a new arena in Newark, New Jersey (eventually a new arena, the Prudential Center, was built in Newark for the New Jersey Devils), the YankeeNets sold the franchise to a group headed by real estate developer Bruce Ratner for $300 million, beating out a group led by Charles Kushner and Jon Corzine. While Kushner and Corzine wanted to keep the Nets in New Jersey, Ratner planned to move the team back to New York. In 2005, the Nets announced plans to locate the team in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. One of the members of the ownership group at the time was rapper and Brooklyn native Jay-Z, who owned less than 0.07% but has been an outspoken face of the ownership team. The new arena, later named Barclays Center, would be the center of an extensive redevelopment project called the Atlantic Yards being constructed by Ratner's real estate development company. The new arena is located across the street from the site that Walter O'Malley wanted to use for a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1950s. That plan was rejected and resulted in the team's relocation to Los Angeles in 1958. The Nets would be the first major professional sports team to play home games in Brooklyn since the departure of the Dodgers.
