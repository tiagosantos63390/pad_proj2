Thor of the Asgard arrives to assist in modifying the Replicator disruptor so that it is once again effective. Although he and Carter successfully modify the disruptor, the Replicators adapt after only a single shot and infest Thor's ship. Meanwhile, Teal'c and Bra'tac are dismayed that, in the face of this unstoppable foe, the Jaffa are re-pledging their loyalty to the Goa'uld en masse and the future of the Jaffa rebellion is in doubt. They decide on an audacious, last-ditch plan: with Ba'al's forces occupied fighting the Replicators, the entire rebel army will capture Dakara, the holiest of Jaffa planets, thus proving once and for all that the Goa'uld are not gods. The rebel Jaffa find the planet lightly guarded and quickly seize its temple. However, at the behest of a robed figure, Ba'al breaks off the battle with the Replicators and sends his entire fleet towards Dakara.

Etymology.
Stapleton is built on part of a long ridge that begins in Barwell to the south, and is followed by the A447 road north, gaining height until it reaches Osbaston, where it descends into a tributary of the River Sence. In terms of rivers, Stapleton's nearest major river is the River Sence, but on a more local level, the River Tweed is the closest waterway, a tributary of which rises in the north of the village. The River Tweed's main source rises from Brick Kiln Hill, just north-east of Hinckley from where it flows north along the eastern edge of Barwell before turning west and continuing to travel in a north-easterly direction.
Ever since the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, Bottle Village has been in dire need of support and funding. The late artist, Joanne Johnson wrote, that the “crumbling Bottle Village is an ironic paradox -- built from castoffs, now cast aside," who was one of the tour guides. This piece of Folk Art is the definition of the saying “one mans treasure is another mans junk,” because of the disrepair the site is in now, there is very little activity. There are very few people who can still give scheduled tours of the village, and because they are volunteers, they do not have very flexible schedules, so personal tours are difficult to book.

Tvind has also been linked to the College for International Co-operation and Development (CICD), located in Hull, East Yorkshire, England. Part of Tvind's "DRH Movement," this residential college advertises widely on the Internet as providing 'training' for young people wishing to volunteer in Africa. However, many former CICD students have complained about poor teaching, low-grade facilities, and being obliged to work long, unpaid hours collecting and sorting used clothes for commercial companies allegedly owned by Tvind. CICD has hundreds of clothes collection boxes across Northern England.
"Appetizing" is used as a noun by itself to refer to these type of foods. Appetizing includes both dairy and "parve" (neither dairy nor meat) food items such as lox (smoked salmon), whitefish, and cream cheese spreads. These foods are typically eaten for breakfast or lunch and, based on Jewish kashrut dietary laws, include no meat products (kosher fish products are not considered meat). The simplest distinction is that an appetizing store is a place that sells fish and dairy products, whereas a delicatessen sells meats (but not dairy products, if it's a kosher deli).
