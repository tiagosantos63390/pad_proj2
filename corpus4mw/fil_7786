In March 2013, the Maccabeats released a music video featuring a medley of songs from Les Misérables performed over reenactments of scenes from the Passover story. This video is unique in that rather than parodying the songs, it contains a capella covers of several of the original songs while drawing attention to how each song's context in the musical is paralleled in Exodus. The video features covers of "Work Song" (over a reenactment of the Jews' lives as slaves in Egypt), "At the End of the Day" (Jochebed putting the baby Moses in a basket in the Nile), "I Dreamed a Dream" (no noteworthy scene from Exodus; an unnamed Jew lamenting the quality of life as a slave), "Who Am I?" (Moses questioning if he is worthy to lead the Jews out of Egypt), the Thénardiers' section and the students' section of "One Day More" (the Ten Plagues and Moses speaking to Pharaoh), and the finale of "Do You Hear the People Sing?" (a song about a freed nation).

Steiner Tor is a-preserved gate in the city of Krems, originally built in the late 15th century but refashioned in the Baroque style. It is considered the symbol of the city. Until the last third of the 19th century, the city of Krems was surrounded by a wall. This was systematically razed, and three gates were also removed. From 2005, celebrating the 700-year anniversary of the city rights, the Steiner Tor was restored as much to its original as possible.
