In "Arizona v. California" (1963), the Court had to determine water rights of tribes along the Colorado River whose reservations were established by both statute and executive order. The Court held that the statute or executive order could not have meant to establish reservations without also reserving the use of water for the productivity of the tribes. Therefore, the Court held the water rights were effectively reserved at the time of the reservation’s creation. Arizona v. California also concerned the quantity of water reserved. The Supreme Court ruled that the tribes were entitled to enough water to irrigate all the “practicable irrigable acreage” on the reservation. 


On 21 October 1537, in Kreuznach, Marie married Frederick of Simmern (b. 1515), later Elector Palatine (1559–1576). The marriage was happy. Marie, who is described as intelligent and religious, influenced her Catholic husband toward Protestantism. In 1546, Frederick finally adopted Lutheranism and assumed the administration of the Franconian territories from his brother-in-law Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Since their family was living in reduced circumstances, Marie repeatedly turned to her uncle Albert of Prussia for financial assistance.

MD 249 begins south of the state highway's intersection with Sheaffer Road on St. George Island. Piney Point Road continues as a county highway toward the southern end of the island. Just north of its terminus, MD 249 begins to closely parallel a riprap along the Potomac River side of the island. The state highway passes along a narrow point of the island where St. George's Creek briefly parallels the northbound side of the highway. MD 249 temporarily leaves the immediate coastline before crossing over a strait between St. George's Creek and the Potomac River on the St. George Island Bridge.
