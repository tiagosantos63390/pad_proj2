Publications from the era testify to shag's popularity throughout the country during the 1930s. They also clue us into the fact that, despite it's enormous popularity, the dance itself wasn't universally known by the name "shag", which only makes tracing its origins more difficult. Arthur Murray's book "Let's Dance" reports that shag was known throughout the United States under various names, like "flea hop". And by the late-1930s there were arguably a hundred or more stylistic variations of the dance.
An interesting form of custom can be found in the west of the country (village of Bucium, Bihor County). Children have a fir tree branch decorated with tinsel, candies and "țingălău" (bell). Whoever does not have a fir tree can go with a stick wrapped in tinsel, on which are held three or four "țingălăi". When they enter the house, those with fir tree sing and those with the stick hit rhythmically the floor after melody. Commonly, every child has his "sorcova". While reciting, "sorcova" is moved in the rhythm of versification, sometimes marked by the sound of the bell.

On "Stories of the Century", authorities send Margaret Jones to pose as the nonexistent "Mrs. Sontag" with the expectation that an outraged Sue Evans will indeed show them the path to the hideout. Howard Negley plays Sheriff Nate Owens, who connects Sontag and Evans to the train robbery at Collis through the discovery of one of the Peruvian coins on Evans' property.
In late June 2013, Moore joined newly promoted Football League Championship side Yeovil Town on trial for their pre-season. On 6 July 2013, Dorchester Town confirmed they had agreed terms with Yeovil Town for the transfer of Moore for an "undisclosed fee", but that Moore had yet to agree personal terms or have a medical with the club. Moore subsequently signed a two-year contract with Yeovil on 10 July 2013. Moore made his debut for Yeovil as an 82nd minute substitute in their Football League Cup first round victory over Southend United, on 6 August 2013. On 14 September 2013, Moore made his Football League Championship debut for Yeovil against Sheffield Wednesday as an injury time substitute. Moore scored his first senior goal for Yeovil, on 4 January 2014, in the FA Cup third round in a 4–0 victory against Leyton Orient. Moore's first season in the Championship ended prematurely with a calf injury meaning he missed Yeovil's final three matches as they failed to avoid relegation back to Football League One. Overall he made 24 appearances for Yeovil in his first season scoring five times making him the club's joint third top goalscorer.
