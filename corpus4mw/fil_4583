On 5 May 1936, Italian troops occupied Addis Ababa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, making it the capital of Italian East Africa. Addis Ababa was governed by the Italian Governors of Addis Ababa from 1936 to 1941. After the Italian army in Ethiopia was defeated by the British army (with the help of "Arbegnoch"), during the Liberation of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa on 5 May 1941—five years to the very day after he had departed—and immediately began the work of re-establishing his capital.

The Electro Gyro-Cator was claimed to be the world's first automated commercially available automotive navigation system. It was co-developed by Honda, Alpine, and Stanley Electric Co.. Unlike most navigation systems of today, it did not use GPS Satellites to maintain its position and discern movement of the vehicle. Rather, it contained helium gas gyroscope that could detect both rotation and movement. A special servo gear was also attached to the transmission housing to feed information to the Gyro-Cator to help maintain position, map speed and distance traveled. Transparent maps were placed inside the unit and it would scroll them past a 6" monochrome CRT illuminated screen as the car traveled along. The monitor would indicate by a series of circles (or cross hairs) on the screen to show your current location or display lines for path of travel. A marking pen was also included to help make personal indicators on the map if needed. Adjustments could made to change the display scale, position, rotation, brightness, and contrast. In its only year of production in 1981, it was announced as an option on that year's Honda Accord and Honda Vigor, but at ¥300,000 ($2,746 USD), it was almost a quarter of the value of the car. It is not clear how many units were actually sold to customers as a "dealer option". A patent for gyroscope design was introduced to the US in design patent D274332. Documented weight for the unit was roughly 20 lb (9 kg). A display unit, with a cutaway of the Gyroscope, is currently shown at the Honda Collection Hall at Twin Ring Motegi, Japan.

After becoming a "heel" in early 1969, he would face the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion in a series of matches throughout the year as well as some of the most popular wrestlers in the territory such as Paul Diamond and Edouard Carpentier. Later that year, he also appeared in the World Wide Wrestling Federation facing "The Canadian Wildman" Gene Dubois, Tony Altimore and Jack Vansky although he was mainly used as a preliminary wrestler and had left the promotion by late 1970. He would however make occasional appearances during the next several years, most notably facing WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Pedro Morales in September 1973 and, the following year, teaming with Baron Mikel Scicluna to defeat WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino & Johnny DeFazio in Hubbard, Ohio on November 1, 1974.

There is some controversy over how connected "Good Old Mountain Dew" ("Good") is to the Irish folk song "The Rare Old Mountain Dew" ("Rare"). "Rare" dates to 1916 or earlier, at least a decade before "Good" was written. The terms "mountain dew" and "moonshine" are thought to have come to the United States from Ireland. Lunsford wrote several parodies and adaptations of other Irish folk songs; based on this, some folklorists claim that the song "Good Old Mountain Dew" was based on "The Rare Old Mountain Dew". Other folklorists disagree, pointing out that the only commonality the songs share is the use of the phrase "mountain dew".
