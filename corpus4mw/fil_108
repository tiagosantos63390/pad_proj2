Along with much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water and ice over the course of millions of years. The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of sandstone and limestone laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural caves to develop, which were expanded into mines when white settlers came to the area. In the time of Prohibition, at least one speakeasy was built into these hidden spaces—eventually refurbished as the Wabasha Street Caves in Saint Paul.

Nîmes became a Roman colony sometime before 28 BC, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation NEM. COL, "Colony of Nemausus". Some years later a sanctuary and other constructions connected with the fountain were raised on the site. Nîmes was already under Roman influence, though it was Augustus who made the city the capital of Narbonne province, and gave it all its glory.

While living in Knoxville, the brothers continued their musical development and first caught the attention of family friend Chet Atkins, who had recently been appointed manager of RCA Victor's recording studio in Nashville. As the brothers transitioned out of the family act and into a duo, they moved to Nashville and Atkins became an early champion of the Everly Brothers. Despite his affiliation with RCA Records, it was Atkins who arranged a chance for the Everly Brothers to record for Columbia Records in early 1956. However, their first and only single for Columbia, "Keep A' Lovin' Me," which Don wrote, was a flop, and they were quickly dropped from the label.

Theories of the phrase's origin include Pliny the Elder's "Naturalis Historia", regarding the discovery of a recipe for an antidote to a poison. In the antidote, one of the ingredients was a grain of salt. Threats involving the poison were thus to be taken "with a grain of salt", and therefore less seriously.

Another important reason for gamers to unite was strength in numbers. What was previously seen as a niche phenomena turned more and more mainstream as the organization gained members. This proved useful in the mid-1990s when claims about role-playing being detrimental to the mental health of youth and links to satanism gained a fair amount of media attention, calling for a ban on tabletop role-playing games or at the very least cut funding for Sverok. Already having gained a large following, Sverok was able to stand as a counterpart to these claims in TV debates and newspaper opinion pages.
Though very small, and surrounded by development, roads and a highway, the park is rich with wildlife. In spring it teams with birds, most noticeable being the many species of Honeyeaters. Australian Fairy Wrens such as the beautiful blue Variegated Wren and the brilliant red and black Red-backed Wren both occur here. In a very large old gum tree Wedge-tailed eagles have made a nest, and the adults are often seen soaring over the park. Calls from White Throated Gerygones, Spangled Drongos and Rainbow Bee-Eaters make a pleasant background sound in the park.
Puckett was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Robert Taylor Homes, a housing project on Chicago's South Side (the escape from which he frequently referred back to during his career). He attended and played baseball for Calumet High School (Chicago). After receiving no scholarship offers following graduation, Puckett at first went to work on an assembly line for Ford Motor Company. However he was given a chance to attend Bradley University and after one year transferred to Triton College. Despite his under-sized 5' 8" frame, the Minnesota Twins selected him in the 1st round (3rd pick) of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft.
