Augusta Jane Wilson, or Augusta Evans Wilson, (May 8, 1835 – May 9, 1909) was an American Southern author and one of the pillars of Southern literature. She wrote nine novels: "Inez" (1850), "Beulah" (1859), "Macaria" (1863), "St. Elmo" (1866), "Vashti" (1869), "Infelice" (1875), "At the Mercy of Tiberius" (1887), "A Speckled Bird" (1902), and "Devota" (1907). Given her support for the Confederate States of America from the perspective of a Southern patriot, and her literary activities during the American Civil War, she can be deemed as having contributed decisively to the literary and cultural development of the Confederacy in particular, and of the South in general, as a civilization. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1977.

On the issue of fair use, the court rejected the parody argument, as Koons could have constructed his parody of that general type of art without copying Rogers' specific work. That is, Koons was not commenting on Rogers' work specifically, and so his copying of that work did not fall under the fair use exception.

If the syndesmosis is torn apart as result of bone fracture, surgeons will sometimes fix the relevant bones together with a syndesmotic screw, temporarily replacing the syndesmosis, or with a tightrope fixation , which is called Syndesmosis Procedure. The screw inhibits normal movement of the bones and, thereby, the corresponding joint(s). When the natural articulation is healed, the screw may be removed. The tightrope fixation with elastic fiberwire suture on the other hand allows physiologic motion of the ankle and may be permanent.
Currently there is no confirmed treatment to prevent or cure allergic reactions to peanuts and strict avoidance of peanuts is the only way to avoid an allergic reaction. The principle treatment for acute allergic reaction is epinephrine, which is generally administered by an epinephrine injector. Antihistamines can be administered in addition to epinephrine. Patients should undergo medical observation following an acute reaction.
