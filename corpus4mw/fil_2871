GDS in the travel industry originated from a traditional legacy business model that existed to inter-operate between airline vendors during the early days of computerised reservations systems of the 1950s. Most airline vendors (including budget and mainstream operators) have now adopted a strategy of 'direct selling' to their wholesale and retail customers (passengers) by investing in their own reservations and direct-distribution systems. Hence significant technology advancements in this space facilitate an easier way to cross-sell to partner airlines and via travel agents, eliminating the dependency on a dedicated global GDS federating between systems. Hence some experts argue that these change in business models will eventually lead to phasing out of GDS in the Airline space by the year 2020.

Taking It All In is the seventh collection of movie reviews by the critic Pauline Kael and contains the 150 film reviews she wrote for "The New Yorker" between June 9, 1980, and June 13, 1983. She writes in the Author's Note at the beginning of the collection that, "it was a shock to discover how many good ones there were", as well as observing that only a very few of the movies she liked were box-office successes - "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", "Tootsie", "". She laments that, "in the '80s, films that aren't immediate box-office successes are instantly branded as losers, flops, bombs. Some of the movies that meant the most to me were in this doomed group - "The Stunt Man", "Pennies from Heaven", "Blow Out", "The Devil's Playground", "Melvin and Howard", "Shoot the Moon", "Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"".
