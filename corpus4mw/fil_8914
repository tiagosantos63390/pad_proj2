Gogulski stated that he renounced his citizenship in order to repudiate the American system, which he felt was the source of many wrongs in the world. Gogulski has stated that he hopes to start a mass movement of Americans giving up citizenship and making themselves stateless "en masse". He receives occasional enquiries from others who are interested in following in his footsteps and becoming stateless themselves; he advises them to "understand all the implications" before they make the leap, pointing out that while he has faced few hardships due to his statelessness, others may find it more difficult due to their personal situations.
On 3 May 2012, Tan Sri Annuar Musa was suspended from taking part in any football activities in Kelantan where he is the President. The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) disciplinary committee found Annuar's negative statement against the national football team on 12 Feb had breached the status of FAM's Article 88 (2010-2014). FAM's Article 88 states that only the president and the secretary-general can comment on the national team's performance.
