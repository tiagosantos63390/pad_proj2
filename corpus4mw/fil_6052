Plot is the core of a play. “Aristotle considered it to be the most important play element of them all." There are two things to remember about the plot – selection and arrangement. Selection pertains to what the playwright decides to actually write about. S/he never decides to tell every facet of the story, but instead chooses important parts that not only progress the story but are also connected to dramatic action.
