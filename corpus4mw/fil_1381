After one of these dating debacles, Pondo frightens Studley by shouting: "I'D SELL MY SOUL FOR A PIECE OF ASS!" A nearby goddess (Suzanne Ashley) – a mysterious woman who has been observing Pondo's struggles for some time – hears his cry and cryptically acknowledges it. Some time afterward, Pondo accidentally creates a chemical compound that makes him irresistible to women. At first he revels in his new "party animal" prowess; later, exhausted and terrified, he takes to barricading himself in his room to escape the mobs of horny women who pursue him everywhere. "I have been greedy," he confesses despairingly to Studley; "I am like King Midas; everything I touch turns to poontang!" He later creeps out, full of fear, to wash his clothes, and is killed by a group of fat middle-aged women who jump him at the laundromat.

The presence of humans in the modern state of Querétaro is estimated at between 1500 and 2500 BCE, with the oldest human remains found at a cave in the San Nicolás community. This site gives no indication that these early humans had either agriculture or pottery. Much later human remains in the same cave indicate the presence of both and perhaps influence from the Las Ranas site to the north. This would put the area within the sphere of influence of this culture, which was Huastec and part of the early Pre Classic period.

The word "opry" is a diminutive form of the word "Opera," coined by broadcaster George D. Hay in 1927 as the new name of Hay's program, the WSM Barn Dance, to demonstrate the realism of folk and country music compared to the theatrics of Grand Opera. At the time, Hay's program followed a program of operatic music. One night Hay began the Barn Dance by stating, "You have just heard opera. Now you are going to hear the Grand Old Opry."

The last part of the novel is devoted to the circumstances of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there ""suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is sitting up in bed, his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognise the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here.""

The Kaurava army consisted of 11 Akshauhinis. Duryodhana requested Bhishma to command the Kaurava army. Bhishma accepted on the condition that, while he would fight the battle sincerely, he would not harm the five Pandava brothers. In addition, Bhishma said that Karna would not fight under him as long as he is in the battlefied. It is believed by many that Bhishma pushed Karna into taking this decision due to his affection towards the Pandavas - the Kauravas would be overwhelmingly powerful if both he and Karna appeared in battle simultaneously. However the excuse he used to prevent their simultaneous fighting was that his guru (Parshurama) was insulted by Karna. He also knew that Karna was a Kaunteya(Son of Kunti) from the day he met him in Ranakshetra when Karna offered Arjuna to fight against him and Bhishma wanted to keep Karna out, so that there will be someone to lead the army once he is unable to continue with the war. Regardless, Duryodhana agreed to Bhishma's conditions and made him the supreme commander of the Kaurava army, while Karna was debarred from fighting. But Karna enters the war later when Bhishma is wounded by Arjuna. Apart from the one hundred Kaurava brothers, headed by Duryodhana himself and his brother Dushasana, the second eldest son of Dhritarashtra, the Kauravas were assisted on the battlefield by Drona and his son Ashwathama, the Kaurava's brother-in-law Jayadratha, the brahmin Kripa, Kritavarma, Shalya, Sudakshina, Bhurisravas, Bahlika, Shakuni, and many more who were bound by their loyalty towards either Hastinapura or Dhritarashtra.
