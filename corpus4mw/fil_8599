The reconciliation between Henry VI and Henry the Lion was held in March 1194 at Tilleda Castle. Agnes and her husband Henry had done their bit to prepare for this major domestic event with their unscheduled marriage at Stahleck Castle. Henry VI wanted to settle the conflict with the House of Welf, so he could have peace in the Holy Roman Empire and enforce the claim on Sicily he had after the death of Tancred of Lecce on 20 February 1194.
He was born as a South Floridan native to Jamaican parents, Loveth and Sylvan Taylor. Along with being a left-handed batsman he was also a wicketkeeper.

Creoch Loch is recorded as being just over 600 metres long. Robert Gordon's map of 1636-52 shows a single loch with an outflow to the River Nith. Blaeu's map of 1654, based on the earlier map by Timothy Pont, also shows a single loch named Loch of the Lowis (sic), however a Black Loch 'section' is recorded at the northern end. Two dwellings named 'Krioch' are shown on this map, an Over and a North Krioch.
He graduated from Holmestrand Teacher's Seminary in 1902, and returned to Kristiania to work as a teacher.

Initially describing "natural places" in the landscape, Semple discusses how the pagan Anglo-Saxons may have understood their surroundings, looking at the manner in which fields and groves were devoted to deities. Proceeding to look at the way in which pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons viewed hilltops, she discusses their association with sites designated as "hearg" in Old English. Semple then looks at the role of fissures, hollows and pits, highlighting how Anglo-Saxons believed them to be inhabited by monsters and goblins, before examining similar ideas regarding water-places, which were believed to be inhabited by "nicor" and which also saw some votive depositions occurring in the Early Mediaeval. Discussing votive offerings to such water-places, she then discusses the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards "ancient remains, monuments and ruins", discussing the re-use of prehistoric burial mounds and Roman-period structures. Rounding off her paper, Semple discusses evidence for pagan temples and shrines in the Anglo-Saxon landscape, as well as sacred beams, poles and totems.
