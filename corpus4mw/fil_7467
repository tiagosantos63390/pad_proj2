Usually at "warm" temperatures the resistivity of a metal varies linearly with temperature. That is, a plot of the resistivity as a function of temperature is a straight line. If this straight line were extrapolated all the way down to absolute zero, a theoretical RRR could be calculated

Setaria pumila is a species of grass known by many common names, including yellow foxtail, yellow bristle grass, pigeon grass, and cattail grass. It is native to Europe, but it is known throughout the world as a common weed. It grows in lawns, sidewalks, roadsides, cultivated fields, and many other places. This annual grass grows 20 centimeters to well over a meter in height, its mostly hairless stems ranging from green to purple-tinged in color. The leaf blades are hairless on the upper surfaces, twisting, and up to 30 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a stiff, cylindrical bundle of spikelets 2 to 15 centimeters long with short, blunt bristles. The panicle may appear yellow or yellow-tinged.
