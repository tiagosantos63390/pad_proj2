The Park is accessible via a one-way long loop road. The main feature is Schoodic Head, the highest point on the peninsula at above sea level. A number of hiking trails ascend the Head.

The lighthouse viewable to the northwest of Schoodic Head, Mark Island's Winter Harbor Light Station, was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
