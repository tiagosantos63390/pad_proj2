"The Freshman" was Lloyd's most successful silent film of the 1920s, and was hugely popular at the time of its release. It sparked a craze for college films that lasted well beyond the 1920s. Exteriors were filmed near the USC campus in Los Angeles. The game sequence was shot on the field at the Rose Bowl, and the crowd scenes were shot at halftime at California Memorial Stadium during the November 1924 Big Game between UC Berkeley and Stanford University. The football game sequence was reused by Lloyd and director Preston Sturges in Lloyd's last film, "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock" (1947).

The action flashes back to a scene two days before Hussein’s attempted robbery, in which Ali comes to tell Hussein that everything has been cleared for Hussein’s marriage to Ali’s sister, The Bride. A con artist, The Man in the Tea House, then joins them and expounds on the profession of pickpocketing. Hussein, naturally sensitive to his social status, is somewhat offended by the con artist’s automatic classification of him and Ali as mere pickpockets. However, the con artist makes one point which can be taken as something of a universal truth: “If you want to arrest a thief, you’ll have to arrest the world.” Later on, Hussein and Ali attempt to enter the jeweler’s shop and are viciously snubbed by The Jeweler, who literally shuts the doors in their faces.
