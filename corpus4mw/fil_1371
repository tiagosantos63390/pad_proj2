The lyrics are, in Harrison's own words, "about the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit". The frustration in the lyrics is reinforced by the song's dissonant atmosphere, a product of numerous elements, including the continuous piano chord in the background and the contrast between Harrison's modest lead vocal and Lennon and McCartney's descant harmonies. Laing writes of the Song's "serene desperation" in its "attempt at real total contact in any interpersonal context"

Records indicate ongoing maintenance included painting in 1887-1889 and saw repainting again in 1890. In 1894, the Conservatory’s surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations in preparations for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition. The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. The grooves in the floor were intended to carry off the surplus water and make a visit to the Conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting and will stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.
The Winning Hand is a double album, released in December 1982, featuring Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Brenda Lee and Kris Kristofferson. The album consisted largely of unreleased tracks from their years with Monument Records (all four of them had recorded for the label during the mid-1960s). Of the four artists, Kristofferson and Lee contributed new vocals, and a number of the original solo recordings were edited together to create "duets". Despite what might have seemed an opportunistic project, designed to capitalize on the later fame of the performers—Parton's and Nelson's careers were at their commercial peaks in 1982—the album was largely well received by critics upon its release and did well on the country charts.

The film has received a negative critical response. Praise was given towards the performances from the cast, but the script, the plot, and the infamous basketball scene received a mixed response and the film was mostly criticized for the lack of character development, unnecessary blood and gore, the nonsensical and ludicrous ending, and scenes that were added or changed because of the demands made by the studio and the producers. AllMovie gave the film a generally negative review, writing, "It's an intriguing combination of elements, but the end result is a schizoid mess", calling Craven's direction "awkward" and opining that it "lacks the intense, sustained atmosphere of his previous horror hits." The film currently has a 0% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was a bomb at the box office, grossing $8,988,731 in the U.S. on an $11 million budget. Although a critical and financial failure, over the years, Deadly Friend was regarded by some as a cult classic and has garnered a fan following.
