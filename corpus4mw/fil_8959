Field Police troopers were distinguished from the rest of the National Police by a black beret made of a single piece of wool attached to a black leather rim-band provided with two tightening-straps at the back. Interestingly, berets were often carefully molded to achieve a pointed shape or ‘Cockscomb crest’, affected by so many South Vietnamese military personnel since it reportedly gave the wearer a more imposing figure and aggressive ‘Choc’ or 'Commando' allure. It was worn French-style pulled to the left, with the National Police cap badge placed above the right eye.

Blues at Carnegie Hall
The opening ceremony was described as a "colourful spectacle" due to the Army's Western Command Band wearing scarlet jackets and white helmets, the Army Guard of Honour in jungle green clothing and the blue uniforms of the mounted escort. The order of the wheelpast was Singapore, India, New Zealand, Rhodesia, Wales, Northern Ireland, England and the host country Australia. Hugh Leslie, the Games Chairman, in his speech said "This event, apart from helping the participants, is designed to prove to the public that the person who is badly handicapped is not a cripple. I hope that this horrible word will eventually be wiped out of use." Senator Shane Paltridge, who was representing the Federal Government, said "This is one fine example of leadership taken by this State in the work to lift the paraplegic from a life of resignation to one of self respect and purpose in the community." At the conclusion of the ceremony, with the crowd of 2,000 still present, there was a basketball match between Australia and England on the outdoor pitch in front of the grandstand. Australia defeated England 20–18. The basketball game had a novel feature, a running commentary by Australian television broadcaster Allan Terry. The ceremony received wide television, radio and newspaper coverage highlighting the importance of the event in rehabilitation.
In April 2001, one of the largest demonstrations by the Chinese community, with around 1,000 people protesting, was held in London against media reports that Chinese restaurants had started the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis by using diseased meat. Within weeks, a Chinese community monitoring group reported that trade at restaurants and takeaways had plummeted because an unsubstantiated rumour had become a scare story labelling an entire community as "dirty". Following the march, the then Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown publicly denied that the rumours had begun in his department and described the controversy as a racist attack on the Chinese community. As of 2001, there were about 12,000 Chinese takeaways and 3,000 Chinese restaurants in the UK.
