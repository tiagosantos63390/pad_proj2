"Digital Spy" gave the song a positive review: "A really good video can make you realise a song's better than you originally thought - a case in point being the new Pink single. Within the context of her Funhouse album, 'Please Don't Leave Me' seemed like a quite good angsty break-up song - one of many quite good angsty break-up songs on there - but after watching the Misery-inspired promo it becomes something far more memorable. "I can be so mean when I wanna be, I am capable of really anything," sings Pink here, one of several lines that resonate harder once you've seen her brandishing a golf club, chucking her invalid boyfriend out of his wheelchair and chasing him round the house with an axe. Still, entertaining as the video is, it's Pink's bruised vocals - which convey the combination of bitterness and regret in her lyrics perfectly - that leave the biggest impression".
