Seton was not able to find a 2006 full-time drive, so he joined Stone Brothers Racing for the two V8 Supercar endurance races, including the Bathurst 1000. Brake issues hampered the #4 SBR Falcon at Sandown where it finished ninth. At Bathurst, the master and apprentice drove smart and finished a hard fought third. Seton moved from Ford and joined his childhood friend and old Nissan Skyline team mate Mark Skaife and for the first time in Seton's career, to drive in a Holden Commodore with the Holden Racing Team as an endurance driver for 2007. He finished 13th in the Sandown 500 with Tony Longhurst and 11th in the Bathurst 1000 with Nathan Pretty. Seton again joined the Holden Racing Team in 2008, driving the #2 car with Craig Baird.
