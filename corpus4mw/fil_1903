In a surprising feat for an underground rock band, the album entered #4 in the UK Rock Charts in its first week, beaten only by high-risers Foo Fighters, Green Day and The Rasmus. It made #87 in the mainstream chart, and one place higher than "Racecar Is Racecar Backwards".


The route was designed to allow a second north-south service, or generally, a Ravenswood-Englewood/Jackson Park through operation with Evanston Express trains also routed into the Franklin Line to a turn-back at Roosevelt Road. Howard-Dan Ryan (Red Line) train operation could have been started as early as January 1, 1984, despite CTA's February 21, 1993 rail system reroute. Lake Street 'L' service was to continue operating over the remaining portion of the Union Loop 'L' until some time later when financial arrangements permitted construction of the Monroe Line, or at least until the Midway Line was built. The Balance of the Project (or the unbuilt segments of the CCATP) would be constructed further into the unforeseeable future.
Evolution.
