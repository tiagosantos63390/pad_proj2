He was a staunch defender of the Church of England, publishing various tracts setting out his strong views. "Of the Heart and its Right Sovereign; and Rome No Mother-Church to England" and "A remembrance of the rights of Jerusalem above, in the great question, where is the true mother-church of Christians?" were both written in 1678. Three years later, he wrote "Some letters and papers from a late chaplain to the duke of York … touching the beginning of this plot and danger to the nation from masquerade protestants". His last work was "Elymas the sorcerer, or, A memorial towards the discovery of the bottom of this Popish-Plot, publish'd upon the occasion of a passage in the late dutchess of York's declaration for changing her religion", written in 1682, and restating his accusations against Morley; Morley replied in various treatises published in the following year.

Description.
In the late 1990s, a national standardization effort known as the Advanced transportation controller (ATC) was undertaken in the United States by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The project attempts to create a single national standard for traffic light controllers. The standardization effort is part of the National Intelligent transportation system program funded by various highway bills, starting with ISTEA in 1991, followed by TEA-21, and subsequent bills. The controllers will communicate using "National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol" (NTCIP), based on Internet Protocol, ISO/OSI, and ASN.1.

In the first episode of the third season, "The Purple Piano Project", Blaine transfers to McKinley High at the beginning of his junior year to be closer to Kurt, who is a senior, and joins New Directions. He later auditions for the role of Bernardo in the school musical "West Side Story", so as not to compete against Kurt who wants to play the male lead, Tony, but is cast as Tony himself. In the episode "The First Time", Blaine is pursued by Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin), a new Dalton Academy Warbler. Kurt and Blaine meet up with Sebastian at a gay bar, Blaine gets drunk, and afterward tries to get Kurt to have sex with him in the car. Kurt refuses, they have a fight, and Blaine decides to walk home. After the "West Side Story" opening night, they apologize to each other, and decide to go to Blaine's house. They are later shown in bed together, apparently having just had sex for the first time. When New Directions and the Warblers informally compete in "Michael" to determine which club can perform Michael Jackson's music at the upcoming show choir Regionals, Sebastian throws a slushie containing rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine interposes himself and is hit in the eye; his cornea is badly scratched and requires surgery. His eye heals, and he is back in time for New Directions to defeat the Warblers at Regionals. Blaine's older brother Cooper (Matt Bomer), a successful actor in commercials, visits Ohio, and the two achieve a rapprochement. Blaine's relationship with Kurt is later strained when Kurt text-flirts with a boy he met while preparing for his NYADA audition, and by Kurt's eagerness to leave for New York after graduation, which would separate the two at least until Blaine graduated the following year. The two patch things up, the glee club wins at Nationals, and the pair is still a couple at the end of the school year, though Blaine is still uneasy about the prolonged physical separation facing them.
