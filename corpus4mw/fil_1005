Nearly every building in the main street was damaged during the Great Siege of Gibraltar when from 1779 to 1783 the town was attacked by a combined French and Spanish fleet. Because main street was near the harbour it was easily bombarded by the ships in the harbour. Col John Drinkwater wrote "that some few, near South-port, continued to be inhabited by soldiers families, but in general the floors and roofs were destroyed and the bare shell only was left standing."

In addition, new employees may be added to an existing unit without the need for either an election or proof of majority support if they share such an overwhelming community of interest with the employees in the existing unit that they could not be represented separately. As an example, a new department in a factory in which a union represents all of the production and maintenance employees in a “wall to wall” unit is likely to be accreted to that unit. The NLRB will not accrete employees to an existing unit, however, if they have been historically excluded from the unit, no matter how strong the community of interest might be; in that case the union must obtain proof of majority support to add them to the unit.

Deir al-Balah is well known for growing date palms, an estimated 20,000 of which covered the landscape south and west of the city in the 1990s. However, some 3,550 trees were uprooted or bulldozed by the Israeli Army in the early years of the Second Intifada beginning in 2000. There were an estimated 16,500 palms in Deir al-Balah in 2003. In addition to being a local delicacy, date cultivation constitutes one of the principal sources of income for many of Deir al-Balah's residents. The particular type of date that is cultivated in the area is known as "Hayani." It has a distinctly red color. Other leading agricultural products cultivated in Deir al-Balah include citrus, almonds, pomegranates and grapes.

The successful series of exhibitions in private galleries begun in 1968 continued (Frankfurt, Geneva, Paris, New York, Milan and Hanover, among others). This year he finally produced "Romeo e Giulietta", using the technique of injection casting, which for the first time enabled him to make 2000 copies of a sculpture. He used similar techniques to make "Goliath" (consisting of 80 pieces) and "Richelieu" (61 pieces). He worked on the book/object "Petite Rapsodie de la main", with text by Loys Masson. Important works produced during this period are "Sainte Agathe II", "Cleopatra" and "Alfa e Romeo", a work specifically studied as an illustration for "Petite Rapsodie de la main". "Mini David" began the series of five mini-sculptures produced in quantities of 10,000 copies, using the automatic injection technique, a subtle procedure hitherto used exclusively in industrial manufacture. The Galería Iolas-Velasco in Madrid presented his sculptures in Spain for the first time. Various well-known dealers created Multicetera, a company for the distribution of his mini-sculptures. He received the Gold Medal from the Presidency of the Italian Republic for “Metal as a pure expression of art” at the V Biennale del Metallo in Gubbio.

Gamesa and Iberdrola are currently making important investments in Juchitán, to create a big wind power eolic park -called Proyecto La Venta II- able to produce at least 88 megawatts of energy. The project will make Juchitán the center of the alternative energies in Mexico becoming an example to the rest of Latin America as the eolic park would be the largest in all the region. This project has been criticized because of the lack of information given by Gamesa, Iberdrola and the Mexican Government about its possible ecological, political and cultural consequences on a region where its culture is based on the property of the land used by the Proyecto La Venta II.
