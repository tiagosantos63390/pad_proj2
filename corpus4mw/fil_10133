In 1975 an exemption was gained from the Development Authority, Lucknow, on the condition that a school should be opened on the premises. The foundation stone of an English-Medium School was blessed by the Archbishop, Dr. Dominic Athaide, and laid by on 13 April 1977. St. Conrad's School was established on 1 July 1977. The school went in for co-education. To begin with, there were only 9 students on the roll. In the beginning there was only one teacher, Mrs. A. Sebastian. It was not in the present building then but in the present chapel which is in the residential block now.

Most of the elven deities (other than Corellon Larethian) are found in the Races of the Wild supplement. They are organized in a pantheon called the "Seldarine" â€” a term which originated in Dragon magazine issue #60, but has been most widely used in the Forgotten Realms setting.
