Grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV) is the fastest growing energy technology in the world, with 50% annual increases in cumulative installed capacity in 2006 and 2007, to an estimated 7.7 GW. This translates into 1.5 million homes with rooftop photovoltaics feeding into the electricity grid worldwide. During 2007, investment in new solar photovoltaic manufacturing facilities was strong in Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States, with many new operations reported. Since October 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario has had vast success with the implementation of their feed-in tariff incentive for grid-connected solar systems. Ontario is currently leading the way in North America with this comprehensive renewable energy incentive.
