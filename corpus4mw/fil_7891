The rule was described in the Mongolian chronicle "Ten Laudable Laws", which describes "two orders", one order based on the religious and one order based on the secular. Religious is based on the Sutras and Dharani, secular on peace and tranquillity. The Sakya Lama is responsible for the religious order, the Yuan Emperor for the secular. The religion and the state became dependent on each other, each with its own functions, but the will of the Emperor, through the d-pon chen, held the "de facto" upper hand.

His school soon became known, and among his pupils were Samuel Sharpe, the Egyptologist and translator of the Bible, Benjamin Disraeli (of whom he used to say, "I don't like Disraeli; I never could get him to understand the subjunctive"), Milner Gibson, Russell Gurney, and Lord Stone. He preached his farewell sermon at Walthamstow on the last Sunday 1816, and in 1828 retired from teaching into private life. His portrait in life-size was painted at the cost of his pupils by Thomas Phillips, R.A., and engraved by Samuel Cousins, and the picture was presented to him at a dinner at the Albion tavern on 20 December 1828.

Seven of the eight leaders of Fianna Fáil have each served as head of government for at least one term of office. In 1932 Éamon de Valera became the first Fianna Fáil leader to become head of government when he was elected President of the Exececutive Council. He remained as leader of Fianna Fáil until 1959 when he retired after serving twenty-one years as head of government and after leading the party to eight general election triumphs. Seán Lemass was the unanimous choice to succeed de Valera as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil that year. He served seven years in both roles before handing over to Jack Lynch in 1966 following the first leadership election in the history of the party. He served as party leader for thirteen years until 1979, nine of which were spent as Taoiseach. Lynch's resignation sparked another leadership election which saw Charles Haughey emerge as Taoiseach and leader of a deeply divided party. His thirteen-year period in charge saw many heaves against his leadership from within the party, with the final challenge hastening his resignation in 1992.


The people of Tojg are mainly dependent upon agriculture; many fields exist around the village. One problem, however, was that for many years the Farah River would be prone to season floods and prevent the local farmers from accessing the main road and their farmlands, so would not be able to transport their goods to market. In order to address this, the US led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) constructed the Tojg Bridge across the Farah River near the village, a project costing $1.7 million, financed by the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). The construction of the 300 metre long, 12 metre high bridge took place between 2007 and 2010 and employed several hundred locals and contractors, built by several companies working together, namely Shir Pir Construction Company, Bradaran Noori, Kheyaban Construction Company, and Meihan Parwar. In December 2009 it was reported to be 80% complete, but construction had been delayed and was ongoing into 2010. The bridge consists of arches.
