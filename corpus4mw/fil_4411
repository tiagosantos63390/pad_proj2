In response to the attack the Sri Lankan military planned and put into motion operation 'Thrivida Pahara' before dawn. The plan called for a relief force to be transported by ship to the sea off the coast of Mullaitivu from Jaffna and to be landed by smaller boats close to the base. Meanwhile the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out attacks on the LTTE. Due to the delay of the transport of troops by sea, initial landings were carried out on the 19th by an all-volunteer force of 275 elite commandos from the 1st Special Forces Regiment led by their CO Lieutenant Colonel A.F. Lafir, who were heli-dropped under heavy LTTE fire and made radio contact with the besieged troops. Although wounded, Lt. Col. Lafir personally lead the attack under direct enemy fire after landing near Alampil until he was killed. He was awarded the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, the highest award for combat bravery in Sri Lanka. The commandos were reinforced on the 19th when troops began to make landings by sea under the protection of Sri Lankan Navy's fast attack crafts. That evening LTTEs Sea Tigers attacked the naval force in suicide boats heavily laden with explosives. The large gunboat SLNS Ranaviru was rammed, causing the Ranaviru to sink instantly with its entire crew of 36. Following this landings were halted.

The art historian Sir Roy Strong has identified a number of inferior copies of Hilliard's portrait miniatures as probably the work of Lockey, pointing out their "weak and laboured brushstrokes" and "smudgy" features.
