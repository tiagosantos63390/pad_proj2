Let A be the adjacency matrix of a network under consideration. Elements formula_8 of A are variables that take a value 1 if a node i is connected to node j and 0 otherwise. The powers of A indicate the presence (or absence) of links between two nodes through intermediaries. For instance, in matrix formula_9, if element formula_10, it indicates that node 2 and node 12 are connected through some first and second degree neighbors of node 2. If formula_11 denotes Katz centrality of a node i, then mathematically:

The Messina tram depot (in Italian: "Deposito tranviario Messina") is the largest tram depot in Milan, Italy, and one of the largest in the world. It is located at street number 14 of Via Messina, close to the Monumentale cemetery. The building of the depot, which dates back to 1912, is a prominent example of early 20th century Milanese industrial architecture, and one of the most important examples of cast-iron architecture in Italy. The depot is still in use by "Azienda Trasporti Milanesi" ("ATM") public transport company. Due to its historical and architectural relevance, ATM occasionally opens the depot to visitors.

Constitutional Assembly elections were held in South Vietnam on 4 March 1956. A total of 431 candidates contested the 123 seats from all five registered pro-government political parties, with 11 elected as pro-government independents.

Two deputies were not permitted to take seats due to electoral violations, making the total number of deputies seated at 121. On 26 October the body was transformed into the National Assembly after the new constitution came into effect.

Although throughout the 1940s and 1950s existentialism was the dominant European intellectual movement, in the 1960s it was starting to lose its influence in the face of growing negative response. During the 1960s, there would be little or no existentialist movement to speak of, and what popularity it had would become far more overshadowed by structuralism, post-structuralism, and postmodernism, intellectual approaches which are today still widely used in academia. However, existentialism, particularly existential phenomenology, would still remain a significant influence on post-structuralism and postmodernism; one commentator has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called "post-phenomenologists." Like existentialism, these approaches reject essentialist or reductionist notions, and are critical of dominant Western philosophy and culture, rejecting previous systems of knowledge based on the human knower. Since the 1980s, therefore, a growing number of anarchist philosophies, represented by the term "post-anarchism," have used post-structuralist and postmodernist approaches.
