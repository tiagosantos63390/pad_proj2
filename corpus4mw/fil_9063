When "Titanic" became a blockbuster in 1997, Peter Miller, Dalessandro's manager, urged him to get a detailed film treatment ready based upon his then-ongoing research. They pitched to directors' production companies, specifically Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks, Barry Levinson's company Baltimore Spring Creek, and Wolfgang Petersen's company. According to Dalessandro, the pitch was "Titanic was a boat in the North Atlantic – this is an entire city, the most beautiful we've ever seen, destroyed in 40 hours." There was an instant bidding war, and within 24 hours they had sold the script to Warner Bros. for six figures. The script then went to Barry Levinson and Paula Weinstein and Spring Creek Productions for production. They settled on this company because producer Len Amato wanted Dalessandro to write at least three drafts, giving the writer more influence. After finishing the drafts, Dalessandro wrote and released his novel "1906" in 2004.

The books were published and printed by John Marshall, one of the most prominent chapbook printers in Newcastle during the early nineteenth century. The books are undated and it is difficult to give an accurate date, but the fact that John Marshall did not move into the Flesh Market premises until 1811, dates them not before that date. Several of the later books can be dated approximately from the events, or dates within the titles. The first volumes appeared around the same time as John Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards, published in 1812. The six volume set of books contain some of the region's traditional songs and generally seem to stick to the same formulae as many other Chapbooks in using the same, or similar, well known songs. There are however a few "different" unusual and rare songs which do not appear in many other similar publications. It is assumed that these books, due to the content, would have been very popular with local population.

When he returned in the late summer of 1909, New York Police captured him on September 20, 1909, while carrying concealed weapons. Immigration officials began efforts to deport him to Italy. However, the courts were unaware of his full criminal background and released him with a suspended sentence. The police believed the killing two months later may have been connected to Gennaro’s black mailing activities. The bakery of the Galluccis had been attacked only a few months before when bullets smashed through the window. Some informants claimed that Giosue Gallucci had been responsible for the killing of his brother in letters that were sent to the police.
