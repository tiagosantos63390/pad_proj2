The plaque showing the main sponsor's logo (the sponsor that provided the bonus money) was added between the contestants' scores on June 7, 2004 (Episode #84). Two weeks later (June 21), an oversized $100 bill was placed underneath the show's sponsor plaque between the contestants. This was changed to a single picture with a wad of money on October 6, 2008.
