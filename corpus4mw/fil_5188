The end of World War Two resulted in a large number of military training gliders being sold as surplus. These included Frankfort TG-1s, Schweizer TG-2s and Schweizer TG-3s. Most of the surplus gliders sold were not ideal trainers for ab initio civilian student flying, as they had high wing loadings and faster stall speeds. This made them suitable for aerotow, but not for winch or auto-tow launches. Furthermore many of these surplus two-place gliders had poor visibility from the rear seat where the instructor sat. Due to restrictions on the use of aluminum in training aircraft, many surplus gliders had wooden wings, making them unsuitable to be kept outdoors on tie-downs.

He was the eldest son and was baptized under the name Vincent. When he was 11 years old, he read about the martyrdom of French Catholic (Lazarist) missionary Jean-Gabriel Perboyre in Wuchang, China in 1840, inspiring him want to become a missionary in China. In 1895, in Paris, Lebbe entered into the Lazarist order. While Lebbe was a seminary student in 1900, the Boxer Rebellion occurred in China, and the Belgian missionary Ferdinand Hamer was martyred in Inner Mongolia. Lebbe nonetheless decided to go to China to promote Catholicism.
