LYM members frequently combine political activity with choral music performance. They sang outside the Democratic Party Convention in Boston in 2004, and in 2007 they performed choral music with lyrics about impeaching Dick Cheney in classrooms at Harvard and Boston University.
The word "robotics" was derived from the word "robot", which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)", which was published in 1920. The word "robot" comes from the Slavic word "robota", which means labour. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called "robots", creatures who can be mistaken for humans – similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the "Oxford English Dictionary" in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.

As early as 1977 there were moves to close the line. But tourist traffic to the Lower Bavarian "spa triangle" ("Niederbayerisches Bäderdreieck" increased its importance again despite the unfavourable routing of the line. There were even through coaches from northern and western Germany to Pocking. On 1 September 1979 the line's centenary was remembered in Pfarrkirchen with special celebrations, not least as a protest against possible plans for closure. Uerdingen railbuses were usually used for scheduled passenger services in the second half of the 20th century.
By studying the conceptual evolution of ideologies, Freeden observes that the relative "political success" of an ideology depends on its ability to impose the belief that its own conceptual definitions are the "correct ones". This thus gives rise to a form of "conceptual competition", in which each ideology performs a continuous "decontestation" of its concepts – that is, it tries to eliminate all possible contestation of its own conceptual definitions, thereby rejecting competing definitions (Marxism will thus reject "private property" as a product of the exploitative nature of capitalism, just as liberalism may view "state intervention" as an infringement of individual freedoms). Not only is this decontestation the product of an "inter"-ideological competition (between ideologies), but it is also the product of an "intra"-ideological competition (within ideologies): hence the success of Hayek's form of neoliberalism during the 1980s, or of the Marxist-Leninist trend in the 1920s.
