After the governorship of Ferencz Ürményi (1780 - 1858, governor from 1823 to 1837) Pál Kiss de Nemskér became new governor while Count Ferenc Zichy (1811–1900) acted as deputy governor and was to become Hungarian secretary of state for commerce in the Széchenyi ministry of 1848. After the death of Adamich, Cimiotti become deputy of Fiume at the royal Hungarian Diet serving in 1836 first as observer, and then taking active part in 1843/4. One of his first task as a deputy, together with Mihály Horhy was to draft a plan for political modernization of Fiume, preserving its autonomy within the Hungarian political system. After the inclusion of the city in the Hungarian system Cimiotti exploited the request (Torvenyjavaslat a Hajdúkerületrol 1843/4) advanced by the Hajdú County (Hajdúság) who constituted a "warrior estate" within Hungarian feudal society and were emancipated by István Bocskay, Lord of Bihar, in 1604-1606 from the jurisdiction of their lords. As the Hajdú, Jász and Cuman districts were freed of feudal obligations providing military service so Fiume had to be exempted by providing maritime service for the Kingdom of Hungary. Cimiotti took also the privileges granted to the Gölnicbánya (German: Göllnitz) miners who, as Bavarian settlers invited by the king of Hungary were granted special privileges.

From archival documents one realises that the enormous columns are not the fragments of a monumental barchessa, like that for the Villa Pisani at Bagnolo, but rather of the façade of a true and proper country residence. The enormous Corinthian colonnade, a direct quotation from the pronaos of the Pantheon, would have reached an overall height of over thirteen metres. Lower porticoes, on a quarter-circle plan and still visible in the 19th century, would have tied the manorial house to agricultural annexes to left and right.
