The story is narrated by a prisoner housed in the back of the haveli, a principal character in this part of the story. Her name is Zaiton Bano (Javeria Abbasi). She has been introduced to Roshi as a prisoner who goes by the name of Mutraba. Another peripheral character who is shown to suffer due to the apparently selfish ways of the family is the driver's beautiful daughter, Jhoomer (Beenish Chauhan), who is married off to Roshi's mentally challenged cousin in a bid to cure him of his illness. Her father is paid a monthly sum to help with his expenses, and Jhoomer is given beautiful clothes and jewels, though she is not considered a member of the family, and treated with disdain and cruelty. Instead of silently suffering her fate, Jhoomer is shown to be feisty and puts up a fight against her oppressors. Initially, she refuses to care for her "husband" and has routine arguments with members of the family, including the patriarch. She is even confined to a desolate cottage in the wild in an effort to mend her ways. Bari is chosen to stay guard there, and it is during his stay that Jhoomer gets attracted to him. His apparent indifference to her beauty and her frustration at her own plight draw her towards him. He is shown to be completely indifferent and somewhat disdainful of her. Roshi, on the other hand, is initially very friendly towards Jhoomer and treats her as a sister-in-law, though her affection is tempered once she notices Jhoomer's obvious infatuation with Bari.
