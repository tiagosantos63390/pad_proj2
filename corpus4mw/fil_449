Aylesbury Grammar School was founded in 1598 by Sir Henry Lee, the Champion of Queen Elizabeth I. It developed as a Grammar School in the centre of Aylesbury until 1907, when it moved to its present site. For many years the school was independent and its intake was co-educational. In 1952 it became voluntary controlled and in 1959 the girls moved to a separate site to become Aylesbury High School. Links with the girlsâ€™ school are retained through joint activities such as school plays, orchestral concerts, dances and theatre visits. The school now has some 1260 boys, of whom 350 are in the Sixth Form.) which destroyed part of the old school buildings. The girls' school became Aylesbury High School and is across the road from Aylesbury Grammar School. The current headmaster is Mark Sturgeon who took over from Stephen Lehec at the start of the 2014-15 academic year.
