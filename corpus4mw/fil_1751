Background.
Ramps are made by building up a mound of sand next to a tree stump. The mound is shaped to give a smooth transition from the slope to the top of the tree stump. The transition slope is then layered with pine needles. Shove-its are performed on the top of tree stump before dropping off the other edge. Cutbacks are performed on the edge of the stump or on the transition slope.
Viscount Hudson, of Pewsey in the County of Wiltshire, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1952 for the Conservative politician Robert Hudson. He was the son of Robert William Hudson and the grandson of soap-flake manufacturer Robert Spear Hudson. The title became extinct on the early death of the first Viscount's son, the second Viscount, in 1963.

At first, the facility was a meeting place for Kraków students. It was a club for creative youth (Klub Młodzieży Twórczej), part of the Old Town Community Centre in the Palace under Arieses. The stage was formed by young artists of many different genres: writers, musicians, visual artists and actors, as well as their friends and faithful audiences. After nearly fifty years Piwnica became a legend of local eccentricity, and the style of the Piwnica cabaret entered the colloquial language as the "underground (piwnica) style" of performance. An account of the cabaret performance at Piwnica is given in a 2010 book "A Long, Long Time Ago & Essentially True" by Brigid Pasulka.
