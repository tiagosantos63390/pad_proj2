Sometime after moving to Philadelphia Godfrey was commissioned to survey the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry's facility. The original intent of the survey was possibly to see if the Institute would be appropriate for the "training city employees." As a result of his survey he recommended that the institute be restructured internally. He was then offered the presidency of the Institute by the Board of Trustees and assumed office on December 1, 1913. During his presidency, per his survey, Godfrey reorganized the Institute by consolidating departments, creating three schools, and standardizing the programs of study into two- and four-year programs. In January 1919 Godfrey developed the cooperative educational system in the School of Engineering. Godfrey resigned on October 1, 1921.
