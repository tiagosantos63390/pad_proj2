Desulfovirgula is a genus of sulfate reducing aerobic endospore-forming Gram-positive thermophilic motile rod-shaped bacteria, isolated from a geothermally active underground mine. "Desulfovirgula thermocuniculi" is the sole species in the genus. Electron acceptors that this organism can utilize include sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur, while H2 (in the presence of CO2) and carboxylic acids can be utilized as electron donors.

Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" called Noble the series' "secret weapon" for his ability to "move with lightning speed between surreal goofiness and touching insecurity, often within a single scene." "Paste" magazine named Noble as the 23rd best performance of 2010, calling him "excellent right out of the gate" and Walter as the "show's best character". "TV Squad" named Walter one of 2010's best television characters. The "Los Angeles Times" called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi."

"Orthalicus reses reses" no longer occupies the Key West Botanical Forest and Garden. In contrast, many populations exist on Key Largo, well beyond "Orthalicus reses reses" historic range, as a result of relocations by shell collectors. The majority of relocations had occurred by the late 1990s. These were largely carried out by private hobbyists, who sought to thwart extinction. However, these actions were poorly documented, and were subsequently poorly monitored. One clear trend is that Key Largo has accumulated more populations than the Lower Keys.
Jane, Joel and Alan were brought together when they were on the staff of a Jewish educational camp. All of them are successful products of individually diverse Jewish educations, yet all of them felt ambivalent about their Jewish educational experiences. That ambivalence motivated them to further their Jewish learning, to work in Jewish education, and to ultimately come to produce Jewish educational materials.
