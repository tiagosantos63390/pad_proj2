There was to be a fourth, unnamed anchor store located at the north side of the mall (facing the Atlantic City Race Track) but the space was never occupied until construction began in 2012 for the addition of two "Junior Anchors" Forever 21 and H&M. Prior to the construction the footprint of this spot was marked by a large grass patch in the parking lot, as well as an underused area across from the food court where the mall entrance would've been. It was rumored that either a movie theater or Steinbach would reside there. With the Steinbach going out of business and a Regal Cinemas that opened at the nearby Hamilton Commons shopping center nothing happened with the space until the mall began its expansion.

The Franciscans, unlike the Dominicans, Carmelites and other orders, have never had a peculiar rite properly so called, but conformably to the mind of St. Francis of Assisi always followed the Roman Rite for the celebration of Mass. However, the Friars Minor and the Capuchins wear the amice, instead of the biretta, over the head, and are accustomed to say Mass with their feet uncovered, save only by sandals. They also enjoy certain privileges in regard to the time and place of celebrating Mass, and the Missale Romano-Seraphicum contains many proper Masses not found in the Roman Missal. These are mostly feasts of Franciscan saints and blessed, which are not celebrated throughout the Church, or other feasts having a peculiar connexion with the order, e.g. the Feast of the Mysteries of the Way of the Cross (Friday before Septuagesima), and that of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin (First Sunday after the octave of the Assumption). The same is true in regard to the "Breviarium Romano-Seraphicum" and "Martyrologium Romano-Seraphicum".
