Maria obtained the title of Lord of Biscay as she was next in line after her father, Lope Díaz III de Haro, died in 1288 and her elder brother, Diego López IV de Haro, died after just one year of holding the title in 1289.
Critical acclaim and wide recognition as an important voice in literature brought him the collections of poetry "Rozmowa z ojczyzną" ("A Conversation with the Fatherland"; 1935; 2nd ed., corr. & enl., 1936), much appreciated by Zuzanna Ginczanka, and "Demonom nocy" ("To the Demons of the Night"; 1936), which won him a coveted prize of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1937 but in private was sharply criticized by Ginczanka. The general adulation showered on him by both the reading public and the critics was tempered by the dissenting voice of Ignacy Fik who wrote of Łobodowski "ad personam" as "a character most alien to the Polish psyche, a pagan Scythian, a Romantic shot through with anarchism and nihilism, an expansive Russian nature whose longings for his Marzanna are inspired by boredom. And where Łobodowski ends, takes over...". Another carping critic, Ludwik Fryde, for his part, accused Łobodowski of "actorship, playacting". However, by 1937 such barbs served as a confirmation of Łobodowski's presence in the public spotlight with his firmly established fame. It has been observed that the latter works for the first time sound a note from now on to be the characteristic theme of Łobodowski's "oeuvre" of tragic pessimism which has been seen by scholars to have its source in the dramatic confrontation between the powers of "élan vital" and biology on the one hand, and those of culture and ideology on the other. Tymon Terlecki (19052000), one of the most astute Polish critics, wrote in 1937 that inasmuch as Łobodowski was difficult of classification in general he did not fit easily within the cultural parameters of "any" known literary tradition.

In early August 1942, when the US Navy expedition arrived at Guadalcanal, it contained 48 LCM (2)s; almost the Navy's entire inventory of LCMs. The force also had a small assortment of earlier designs of barges and ponts, plus 116 Landing Craft Vehicle (LCV)s, each able to hold 10,000-pounds of cargo, such as a 75mm pack howitzer, a 105mm howitzer, or 1-ton truck, but heavier equipment (90mm and 5 inch guns, heavy trucks, and the Marine’s tanks) would have to be carried in the LCM (2)s.
