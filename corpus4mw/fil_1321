Other programs that are being implemented to help the wild population include the regular mowing of meadows by private home owners, and especially habitat restoration for properties owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One of the most essential components of the "Speyeria zerene" habitat is the blue violet, or "Viola adunca"; it is used for the food and shelter of the early stages of a larva's life. However, the blue violet is also threatened by invasive species and the overgrowth of shrubs and trees in meadows. The facilities that have established breeding programs for the butterflies have also set up nurseries for the blue violets. These nurseries are mainly used to provide food for the larvae reared in these facilities, but some violets are also transported and planted in restoration sites.

First it is also necessary to use roots of unity, though Hilbert may have implicitly meant to include these. More seriously, while values of elliptic modular functions generate the Hilbert class field, for more general abelian extensions one also needs to use values of elliptic functions. For example, the abelian extension formula_1 is not generated by singular moduli and roots of unity.

At Lanier H.S., Ellis scored a career-best 72 points in a game against Greenwood High School. As a junior, he scored 42 points in an 80–75 loss against renowned high school basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, then the #1-ranked prep-basketball team in the country by USA Today, and their future NBA duo that consisted of point guard Rajon Rondo and forward Josh Smith, in front of a capacity crowd at the Marshall County Hoopfest in Benton, KY. His 42 points set a new record for the most points anyone had ever scored against Oak Hill. In his senior season he scored 42 points in a game against South Gwinnett High School in which he was guarded by Louis Williams, at the Coliseum. He led Lanier to a 129–16 record in his four seasons as a starter (2002–2005), winning the 4A state championship in 2002 (33–5) and 2005 (35–2, ranked #12 nationally by USA Today) and runner-up finishes in 2003 (31–4) and 2004 (30–5). He scored a total of 4,167 points in his prep career, making him second all-time in Mississippi history. He received first-team all-state recognition from the Clarion-Ledger in all four of his high school seasons and was named Mississippi's "Mr. Basketball" by the paper in 2005.
