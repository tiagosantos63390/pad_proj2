Gomez agreed with Senator Marco Rubio's position that a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants should only become available after the U.S.-Mexico border was certified as secure. Although opposed to high-capacity assault rifle bans, Gomez supported extended background checks on gunowners. Gomez indicated that he is personally pro-life, but acknowledged that because he considers abortion to be a difficult, personal choice, he would not seek to change existing laws allowing abortions.

After graduating from high school, Plotnikov joined Seneca College and traveled to other countries with the school's international tourism program. He also began reflecting about human existence, searching for an answer in holy books of the three Abrahamic religions. He took interest in Islam around 2008 and in 2009 he visited an unknown Toronto mosque, where his father said his son came into contact with "a mullah who had very radical views." Soon, Plotnikov adapted and observed strict Muslim customs, isolated himself from his friends and cut off most communication with his family. In September 2010, Plotnikov disappeared, leaving a note that he was going to France for Ramadan. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been looking for William as a missing person for almost two years by then.

The MARS International Registry, with data from more than 500 patients (although sponsored by the manufacturer), shows that the adverse effects observed are similar to the control group. However, in these severely ill patients it is difficult to distinguish between complications of the disease itself and side effects attributable to the technique.
On May 9, 1988 a pond located at a nearby residence near the site suffered a fish and bird kill. Numerous dead fish (shad and catfish) and ten dead birds (Snowy Egrets) were found around the perimeter of the pond. Upon necropsy, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) determined the fish tissue was contaminated by high levels of several different pesticides. The CDFG analyzed the pond and concluded that high winds blew pesticides from the Stoker airplane cleaning activities into the pond. After the discovery of dead birds and fish, the pond was closed to public activities due to the belief of contamination. Later in 1988, an on-site warehouse that contained pesticide supplies caught fire and burned to the ground. The fire started in the east end of the warehouse where sulfur and diatomaceous clays were stored. To avoid health risks, businesses and residences within a 2-mile radius were evacuated. During the fire, approximately 300 tons of soil were contaminated and later disposed of in a landfill regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
The derivation starts with Fick's first law using a uniform distance axis, y, as the coordinate system and having the origin fixed to the location of the markers. It is assumed that the markers move relative to the diffusion of one component and into one of the two initial rods, as was chosen in Kirkendall's experiment. In the following equation, which represents Fick's first law for one of the two components, D1 is the diffusion coefficient of component one and C1 is the concentration of component one.
