The cluster-expansion approach is a technique in quantum mechanics that systematically truncates the BBGKY hierarchy problem that arises when quantum dynamics of interacting systems is solved. This method is well suited for producing a closed set of numerically computable equations that can be applied to analyze a great variety of many-body and/or quantum-optical problems. For example, it is widely applied in semiconductor quantum optics and it can be applied to generalize the semiconductor Bloch equations and semiconductor luminescence equations.

The "Blitz" class avisos were the first step toward creating the modern, steel-hulled light cruiser, which would ultimately come to fruition in the , built a decade later. The "Blitz"-class ships were also the first steel-hulled ships of any type built by the German Navy. At the time of their completion, they were among the earliest torpedo cruisers in the world.
