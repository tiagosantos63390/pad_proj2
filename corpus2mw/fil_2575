The authorship of Ambrose of Milan, for which Pimont contends, is not admitted by the Benedictine editors or by Luigi Biraghi. The hymn is found in a hymnary in Irish script (described by Clemens Blume in his "Cursus", etc.) of the eighth or early ninth century; but the classical prosody of its two stanzas ("solita" in the third line of the original text is the only exception) suggests a much earlier origin.

In the end of the 19th century a new type of antisemitism had begun to develop in Europe- the racial antisemitism which developed as part of the development of the nationalism and the effects of the industrial revolution. The main idea of the racial antisemitism, as presented by racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, is that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to the European nations.
