"What the Water Gave Me" is five and half minutes long and contains ethereal vocals, harps, and British folk rock. A gospel organ and choir along with "trilling" guitars provide instrumentation in "What the Water Gave Me". According to Bill Lamb of About.com, "the song breaks down into a near a capella chorus three minutes into the song in gorgeous fashion, but it is only a foreshadowing of what is to come". A writer for "Los Angeles Times" wrote that the song consisted of "soaring gospel-rooted harmonies and tribal chants on top of ethereal harp strings and intense lyrics". Another writer for "NME" stated that the song starts as a gothic track from the '80s and compared it with songs by The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

On the human racer's side this system allows up to four players to simultaneously compete in the same race using the same PC.
