During the Complex Off-design calculation, the operating point on the compressor map is constantly being guessed (in terms of formula_92 and formula_93) to obtain an estimate of the compressor mass flow, pressure ratio and efficiency. After the combustion calculation is completed, the implied compressor mechanical shaft speed is used to estimate the turbine corrected speed (i.e. formula_103). Typically, the turbine load (power demanded) and entry flow and temperature are used to estimate the turbine enthalpy drop/inlet temperature (i.e. formula_104). The estimated turbine corrected speed and enthalpy drop/inlet temperature parameters are used to obtain, from the turbine map, an estimate of the turbine corrected flow (formula_100)

The mitigation initiatives that a community develops must have their basis in the community’s guiding principles on hazard mitigation. The initiatives must also actively reduce a community’s vulnerability to hazards. This can be justified through the vulnerability assessment section of the strategy. Finally, mitigation initiatives must accurately reflect the community’s needs. The working group assigned to develop the strategy can help assure that local needs are incorporated in the mitigation initiatives. These steps prevent projects that have no basis in a community’s overall vision of hazard mitigation, or in its vulnerability to hazards on the vulnerability assessment, from being proposed.

The Capitol State Forest is managed by Washington Department of Natural Resources. It is a multi-use forest with active logging operations and is open for off-road motorcycles, mountain biking, horseback riding, and hiking. It is approximately bounded by U.S. Route 12 to the southwest, Interstate 5 to the east and State Route 8 to the north. It roughly contains the Black Hills.

In 1913 the DSS&A's freight operations peaked at almost 1 million short tons (900,000 metric tons), of which more than half were forest products. In the late 1910s, timber yields began to decline all over the Upper Peninsula. This was a blow from which the DSS&A could not recover as an independent nameplate. Its story from 1920 onwards was that of the American railway industry as a whole, with negative factors intensified by unfavorable local business conditions in northern Michigan.

Kahn's second magazine was "Dynamite". Created for Scholastic Inc., it changed the fortunes of the company, becoming the most successful publication in its history and inspiring two similar periodicals for Scholastic, "WOW" and "Bananas". Kahn followed with another magazine, "Smash", for Xerox Education Publications and hired designer Milton Glaser as its art director.

After the end of the Persian Gulf War, Rowaished returned to Kuwait and continued with his music career In 1995, he signed a contract with the Saudi record company Rotana, since they offered him a better contract to which Farasan Music Production Company was paying, so he opted for the money, which is the logical thing to do. Rowaishid's first album for Rotana was "Lummi Bishouq," which was released in 1996. His latest album, entitled "Ma Fee Ahad Mertah," was released in June 2005.

There are at least twelve pairs of dorsal ribs; some displaced elements might represent a thirteen pair. The third and fourth rib have expanded lower ends that in life probably were attached to cartilaginous sternal ribs, themselves connected to sterna that in the holotype specimen have not (yet) ossified. The lower rump is covered by a basket of eighteen pairs of gastralia or belly ribs. Mysterious shaft parts present near the forelimbs are by Dal Sasso & Maganuco interpreted as the remains of a nineteenth frontmost element consisting of two completely fused shafts homologous to the normal medial elements of a pair of gastralia; such a chevron-like bone has also been reported with "Juravenator". The gastralia form a herringbone pattern, the left and right medial elements overlapping each other at their forked ends in order that the basket can expand and contract to accommodate the breathing movements of the abdomen.

The Prussian ships were led by privateers Vincent Stolle and Matthew Kolmener, of Gdańsk; and Jacob Vochs of Elbląg; with support from troops of the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. Initially the Gdańsk sailors, facing the incoming Teutonic flotilla alone, had only ten "szniks" (light sail boats common in the Baltic in the 15th century) which were staffed with five hundred men armed with crossbows and arquebuses. To delay the enemy, they sank a galley at a narrow part of the Vistula, which blocked the entrance from the lagoon to the river. Coming upon the obstacle, von Erlichshausen stalled long enough for the Elbląg ships to join up with those of Gdańsk. Together, the two cities had around 30 ships of various types, 600 to 700 armed men, and a similar number of sailors manning the ships themselves. Von Erlichshausen ordered a withdrawal into the lagoon where his ships bunched up close to the shore. The cities' ships on the other hand, came out of the river into the lagoon and formed themselves into a crescent formation.
He invented the microphone.
