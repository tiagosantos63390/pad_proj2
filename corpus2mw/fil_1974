England began day five looking as though they were looking to drag the day out for a draw, but Jones and Border had other ideas. Resuming their free-scoring from the previous evening, the pair moved rapidly onwards, Jones scoring at better than a run-a-ball for a well made 40 not out off 34 balls. Although not quite as rapid, Border's 60 not out off 76 was still quite pacey, and the captain clearly had a plan in mind when he soon declared the Australian innings closed at 230 for 3, leaving England an unlikely 401 for victory off two sessions.

2009 Air Conditioner Controversy.
The paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division "Screaming Eagles" jumped between 0048 and 0140 British Double Summer Time on June 6. The first wave, inbound to Drop Zone A (the northernmost), was not surprised by the cloud bank and maintained formation, but navigating errors and a lack of Eureka signal caused the first error. Although the 2nd Battalion 502nd PIR was dropped as a compact unit, it jumped on the wrong drop zone, while its commander, Lt Col. Steve A. Chappuis, came down virtually alone on the correct drop zone. Chappuis and this stick captured the coastal battery soon after assembling, and found that it had already been dismantled after an air raid.

Off of the strength of his 2008 season, the Dominican Republic national baseball team offered Ramírez the opportunity to pitch for his country in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. However, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi indicated that Ramírez was in competition for a middle-relief job, and Ramírez focused on his chances of making the Yankees' roster, declining the invitation and remaining in camp with the Yankees. In February, Ramírez suffered shoulder bursitis, which was initially considered mild. Ramírez underwent an MRI on his right shoulder during spring training. He made the Yankees' Opening Day roster, but disappointed with poor results. Ramírez pitched to a 5.19 ERA in 15 games, allowing 15 walks in innings. On May 19, 2009, Ramírez was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room on the roster for pitcher Brian Bruney, who was activated off of the disabled list.
