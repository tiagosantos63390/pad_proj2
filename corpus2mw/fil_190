Omura's whale (henceforth "B. omurai") has several unique skeletal features that distinguish it from its congeners, namely "B. brydei" and "B. edeni". In "B. omurai" and "B. brydei", the posterior end of the ascending process of the maxilla widens to become squarish, whereas in "B. edeni" it is slender and round throughout its length. In "B. omurai", this widened posterior portion conceals the premaxilla, which disappears below the maxilla and nasal and does not reach the frontal, whereas in both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni" the premaxilla reaches the frontal. The parietals flare laterally in dorsal view in "B. omurai" and the Indo-Pacific form of "B. brydei", but are invisible in dorsal view in "B. edeni" and the North Pacific form of "B. brydei". "B. omurai" has two small foramina "along the suture between the parietal and squamosal in the posterior wall of the temporal fossa", which both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni" lack. "B. omurai" has an oblique ridge on the dorsal side of the maxilla near the base of the rostrum, which is absent in both "B. brydei" and "B. edeni". Unlike "B. edeni", the alisphenoid is separate from the squamosal in "B. omurai". The head of the first rib is not bifurcated in "B. omurai", unlike "B. brydei" and "B. edeni".
