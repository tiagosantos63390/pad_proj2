Other early steam locomotives such as Murray's "Salamanca" (1812) and George Stephenson's "Blücher" (1815) and "Locomotion" (1825) also used return connecting rod engines. These all had heavy vertical cylinders set in tandem within the boiler barrel, driving through transverse crossheads above the locomotive, supported by swinging links. The complexity of this motion led to it being named " 'the knitting' " by drivers. The swinging link was simpler than Watt's earlier parallel motion and did not constrain the crosshead to move in such an accurate straight line. However the additional length of the connecting rods for a return connecting rod engine, relative to the piston stroke, made this angulation effect less serious. The "Steam Elephant" used a rudimentary set of slidebars to support the crosshead instead.
