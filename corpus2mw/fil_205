Some say that its name comes from that of a female cacique, called Loaíza or Yuíza, that governed the region formerly called Jaymanío, in the shores of the Río Grande de Loíza. It is said that this cacique might have married a mulatto conquistador called Pedro Mejías, but there is no evidence of this. Other sources point to a Spanish landlord called Iñigo López de Cervantes y Loayza, who owned a lot of the territory, and was renowned among governors and colonists from the time.
Digital philosophy (DP) is one type of digital physics and pancomputationalism. The school of philosophy called pancomputationalism claims that all the physical processes of nature are forms of computation or information processing at the most fundamental level of reality. Pancomputationalism is related to several larger schools of philosophy: atomism, determinism, mechanism, monism, naturalism, philosophical realism, reductionism, and scientific empiricism. Pancomputationalists believe that biology reduces to chemistry reduces to physics reduces to computation of information. Fredkin's career and achievements have much of their motivation in "Digital Philosophy", a particular type of pancomputationalism described in Fredkin's papers: "Introduction to Digital Philosophy", "On the Soul", "Finite Nature", "A New Cosmogony", and "Digital Mechanics".

The first patriotic song of Quebec (then known as "le Canada") was written by a soldier, François Mariauchau d'Esgly. Entitled "C'est le Général de Flip", it paid tribute to the resistance of the French at Quebec during the siege of General William Phips in 1690.
Macroscopically the hemispheres are roughly mirror images of each other, with only subtle differences, such as the Yakovlevian torque seen in the human brain, which is a slight warping of the right side, bringing it just forward of the left side . On a microscopic level, the cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex, shows the types of cells, types of neurotransmitters and receptor subtypes to be markedly asymmetrical between the hemispheres. However, while some of these hemispheric distribution differences are consistent across human beings, or even across some species, many observable distribution differences vary from individual to individual within a given species.

In the 5th grade, he began studying viola and voice. He never completed his formal training, though, since he never became comfortable with reading musical notation. He began looking for ways to generate sounds similar to those he heard in his mind. He started improvising on his parent's piano to hear the sound of the sustained strings droning in tonal combinations, à la Charlemagne Palestine. He began building his own synthesizer in 1976, when he was 13 years old. In the years that followed, he adopted several musical influences ranging from John Cage and Terry Riley to Cluster and Klaus Schulze.
Zhang and Ganfu (as well as Zhang's Xiongnu wife and son) were eventually able to escape and, passing Lop Nor and following the northern edge of the Tarim Basin, around the Kunlun Mountains and through small fortified areas in the middle of oases in what is now Xinjiang until they made their way to Dayuan and eventually to the land of the Yuezhi. The Yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including alfalfa for animal fodder. However, the Yuezhi were too settled to desire war against the Xiongnu. Zhang spent a year in Yuezhi and the adjacent Bactrian territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before beginning his return trip to China, this time following the southern edge of the Tarim Basin.
