The unit not only included motorized infantry, armoured cars and artillery but also various logistics and medical support units. In March 1944, an artillery battery of four 25 pounder guns operated by troops from Luxembourg was added to the brigade's artillery unit. 80 Luxembourgers were serving with the "Brigade Piron" by August 1944 when the Brigade landed in Normandy.

Mao criticized Stalin for having no faith in the peasantry and the masses of people, being mechanical in his understanding of the development of socialism, and not actively engaging the masses in the struggle for socialism. "'Politics in command' and the 'mass line' are not stressed. There is no discussion of 'walking on two legs,' and individual material interest is onesidedly emphasized. Material incentives are proclaimed and individualism is far too prominent," Mao wrote of Stalin in 1961. The Mass Line is a method of leadership that seeks ostensibly to "learn from the peasants."

A Quality Protocol sets out criteria for the production of a product from a specific waste type. Compliance with these criteria is considered sufficient to ensure that the fully recovered product may be used without harm to human health or the environment and therefore without the need for waste management controls. In addition, the Quality Protocol indicates how compliance may be demonstrated and points to best practice for the use of the fully recovered product. The Quality Protocol further aims to provide increased market confidence in the quality of products made from waste and so encourage greater recovery and recycling.

Eggleston and his first officer, Ken Reynolds — who was also a qualified ship's master — disagreed regarding the best course of action. The captain wanted to refloat "Koolama", using the high tide, and head back to the small port of Wyndham; he believed that the ship could pump out enough water to survive 48 hours at sea, and could be steered with its engines. However, Reynolds believed that "Koolama" should be abandoned. The crew split into two factions along these lines. Because of this, some people would later accuse Reynolds of mutiny.
