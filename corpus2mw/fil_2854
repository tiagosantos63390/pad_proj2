However, English authors were still given far more attention than American, and William Wordsworth was the most reviewed of all. Essays were written about the new Romantic movement. In general, the "Eclectic" preferred Wordsworth to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, particularly after the publication of "Kubla Khan", calling on him "to break off his desultory and luxurious habits, and to brace his mind to intellectual exertion". Percy Bysshe Shelley was criticized for his profanity and atheism, however John Keats was judged to have "promise". After Wordsworth, it was Byron's poetry which was reviewed most often. The "Eclectic" criticized it, but heralded works such as "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage", writing that the reader would "be dazzled even to tears". The major novelists of the time were not neglected. For example, Sir Walter Scott's novels were reviewed, due to their popularity, "but his works were regarded with a certain ambivalence". In reviewing "Ivanhoe", for example, the reviewer wrote that it was "one of the cleverest of all our Author's productions" but that it was "a failure" as a romance. Almost all of Charles Dickens's novels were reviewed in the "Eclectic", as were novels by the Brontës, William Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Victor Hugo, and George Eliot. According to Basker, "the "Eclectic"'s treatment of the novel was balanced, insightful, and sophisticated". The "Eclectic" also reviewed the works of important literary figures such as George Crabbe, Robert Burns, James Hogg, William Hazlitt, Stendhal, and Goethe. It did not shy away from reviewing the works of controversial figures, however, such as Thomas de Quincey. It reviewed the works of both Brownings, calling Elizabeth Barrett Browning "the Schiller of our higher nature" and compared Robert Browning to Tennyson. The "Eclectic" also claimed to be the first journal to "discover" and "to notice at any length" Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market and Other Poems".
In 1929 Hecht became a founding member of the group, "La Jeune Gravure Contemporaine", which staged annual group shows and was influential in keeping the spirit of printmaking alive. Hecht also associated with members of "Les Peintres-Graveurs Indépendants", founded in 1923 by J. E. Laboureur and Raoul Dufy. It is doubtful that Hecht knew each member of these groups, but it is probable that he was familiar with their work and they with his, and that this provided an opportunity for the exchange of techniques, subjects, and ideas. Hecht was an intermediary between the avant-garde artists of Atelier 17 and more traditional printmakers.

Skeptics argue that health care as an unregulated commodity invokes market failures not present with government regulation and that selling health care as a commodity leads to both unfair and inefficient systems with poorer individuals being unable to afford preventive care.

"Orthalicus reses reses" no longer occupies the Key West Botanical Forest and Garden. In contrast, many populations exist on Key Largo, well beyond "Orthalicus reses reses" historic range, as a result of relocations by shell collectors. The majority of relocations had occurred by the late 1990s. These were largely carried out by private hobbyists, who sought to thwart extinction. However, these actions were poorly documented, and were subsequently poorly monitored. One clear trend is that Key Largo has accumulated more populations than the Lower Keys.
