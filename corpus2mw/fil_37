Marcus Aurelius, in his "Meditations", says nothing of Fronto's rhetorical teaching; nor, although writing in Greek, does he so much as mention his teacher of Greek rhetoric and longtime friend Herodes Atticus.

The carambola is known under different names in different countries. It should not be confused with the closely related bilimbi, with which it shares some common names. It is also called "starfruit" in English (including Jamaican English and Philippine English) and literally translated into "Stjernefrugt" in Danish, "Sternfrucht" in German, and "Stjärnfrukt" in Swedish. In Spanish, it is known as "carambola", "carambolo", "tamarindo chino", "tamarindo culí", "balimbín" (Philippine Spanish, from Tagalog "balimbing", plural is "balimbines"), and "fruta china" (Ecuador).

In Spenser's allegory, Britomart connotes the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I of England.
