The age links him to Edward’s Death certificate and the degree to the 1851 Census entry, both found in London, England. So, the three references refer to the same man. In the Admission Papers to King's Inn, Dublin is an entry "Twycross, Edward, 3rd son of John, Dublin jeweller and Sarah Clarke. Ed. York Street, Dublin".
