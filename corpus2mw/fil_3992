Description.

This tree, growing to 8 m tall, is found in dense, humid forest. Whorls of five or six leaves, up to 40 cm long, are borne at the end of branchlets. It is very similar to "Actinodaphne obovata" but can be distinguished by the glabrous branchlets, leaves and buds; and smaller fruits with more slender pedicels.
