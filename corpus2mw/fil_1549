October 20, Ukrainian Parliament voted to amend Ukraine's Constitution (390 out of 438 in favor) to remove provision related to Parliamentary immunity that prevents a member of parliament from being criminally liable, detained or arrested without the consent of the Verkhovna Rada. An earlier proposal to only remove immunity from the Parliament was defeated. The proposed new provisions also limits presidential immunity. The president can not be detained or arrested without the consent of the parliament however on conviction of an offense the President automatically loses office. The proposed amendments have been forwarded to Ukraine's Constitutional Court for review and will need to be reaffirmed by the parliament in February 2010

While his reputation is somewhat overshadowed by that of his brilliant, pious and short-lived pupil Honinbo Shusaku, it is undecided and to an extent imponderable who was the stronger, the typical playing conditions of the time meaning that they did not test this in matches played purely as competition. Shusaku's games having been published soon after his death, they became a training manual, adding to the impression of the pupil's level. Shusaku possessed an unusual modesty, and would always take black against out of respect for his teacher, even upon reaching 7-dan. Shuwa played a famous 17 game series with Shusaku between 1846 and 1847, which contained some of the best Go of the classical era. Taking white in all games, Shuwa lost the series 4-13, and his overall results against Shusaku were 6-17-1, but in light of the handicaps and Shusaku's natural brilliance at the Go board, it is virtually impossible to compare the two players.
