Book.
Fricke later wrote of his experience in a book, "Reflections of a Rock Lobster: A Story about Growing Up Gay". He later collaborated with his father, Walter, on "Sudden Strangers: the Story of a Gay Son and his Father", a book about their relationship and of the elder Fricke's coming to terms with his son's homosexuality.
