In addition to her original studio songs, Lavigne has also covered songs by other artists, both in live performances and on studio releases. Her first was "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" by Bob Dylan, which she first performed in 2003. She has also covered several songs on each of her four world tours, including Green Day's "Basket Case", Blink-182's "All the Small Things", and Coldplay's "Fix You".

Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities.

World War II is often cited along with air conditioning as the genesis of the region’s population boom. With three military pilot training fields in the East Valley, military personnel along with mechanics and office workers flocked to the region. Some never left and others came back after the war.

Census numbers tell the story.
