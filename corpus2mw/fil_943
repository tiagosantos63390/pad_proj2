DeVitto started her career by working in commercials, which she described to be a "stepping stone to get to TV and film jobs." She was signed to "Ford" and "Avenue One" modeling agencies, but in 2002, she realized her future wasn't in modeling and chose to pursue a career in acting. Staying true to her love of music, in 2002 she played violin with the Tommy Davidson Band at the Sunset Room in Hollywood. She also played violin on Raphael Saadiq's 2004 album, "Ray Ray," as well as Stevie Nicks's 2011 album "In Your Dreams".
