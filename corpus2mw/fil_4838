The Simon's Town Museum was established in 1977 by a group of enthusiastic volunteers, the MOTHS (War veterans of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats) of the “Snoekie Shellhole” and the Simon’s Town Historical Society. At first, the Simon's Town Museum was located in the old Headmaster’s house, but its rapid expansion led the Board of Trustees to look for new premises. They bought and renovated The Residency, an historical building erected by Governor Joachim van Plettenberg in 1777, to serve as the winter residence of the Dutch East India Company Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, when on official business at Simon’s Bay. To date, it remains the home of the Simon’s Town Museum.

Since 1992, the CNUE has been constantly evolving, in terms of both its internal structure and its functions. Over the years the CNUE has become progressively larger, first with the addition of Spain, Portugal, and Austria. Nine additional notariats became members in 2004 in parallel with the enlargement of the EU, enabling the organisation to make a significant leap from 10 to 19 members. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, bringing the number of member notariats to 21 of the 27 EU Member States. On July 1, 2013, the Croatian notariat also joined the CNUE.

It was for that elite population that several private schools were established in the area, such as Scotch College (1897) and Presbyterian Ladies' College (1915).

The French game of Tarot, also Jeu de Tarot, is one which uses the full 78-card Tarot deck. A typical type of Tarot playing card deck is that of the standard French design, the so-called "Tarot Nouveau", which is French-suited and has face and number layouts similar to the common 52-card deck. The "Tarot Nouveau" deck has trumps which depict scenes of traditional French social activities, in increasing levels of wealth; this differs from the character and ideological cards of the standard Italian-suited Tarot decks such as the Tarocco Piedmontese, the Tarocco Bolognese, the Rider-Waite or even the Tarot de Marseille well known in cartomancy.
Another source states that the railway was built with cast-iron fish-bellied rails from the start after Robert Cunninghame visited the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway. The line had reached the coal quay by 1827 following an agreement with the Earl. This waggonway continued in use until 1852 when the export of coal from Saltcoats ceased and the line was lifted for scrap. It had been extended eastward towards the Bowbridge Pit near the Ardeer Stone Quarry, employing twenty men and horses. The canal may have largely fallen out use due to the railways construction.

Pomptinus was made one of Crassus' commanders following his order by the senate to defeat Spartacus and his army of slaves. When Gannicus and Castus, two of Spartacus' former commanders, split from the main force with around 12,300 rebels, Pomptinus and another commander: Quintus Marcius Rufus, were dispatched to defeat them. Two legions were placed under his and Pomptinus' command, and they succeeded in defeating both Gannicus and Castus somewhere in Cantenna, during the decisive battle in 71 BC. 
Career.
The year of 1954 was to be HMAS "Australia"'s last in service, with the ship conducting Royal and Vice Regal tasks as some of its final duties. In February and March, HMAS "Australia" served as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht "Gothic" during the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation tour. The cruiser was presented with the Gloucester Cup on 25 March as the ship "considered to be foremost in general efficiency, cleanliness, seamanship and technical training" during the year of 1953. As one of the ship's final duties with the Navy, "Australia" was tasked with transporting Field Marshal Sir William Slim, the Governor-General of Australia, along with his wife and their staff on a cruise around the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and the Whitsunday Passage. The voyage embarked on 4 May, and two days later "Australia" fired its 8-inch guns for the final time. While in the Coral Sea, a Dutch naval ship was discovered to be incapacitated off the coast of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, and was consequently towed by "Australia" to Cairns. McNicoll was later appointed a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch government for his rescue of the ship.
