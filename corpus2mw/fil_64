A new emphasis on the arts, culture and local history has emerged, culminating in the Townscape project to beautify the Courthouse Square Historic District. However, a great deal of effort has also been expended in securing the town a reputation as a retirement center. To that end, many retirement homes and assisted-living facilities have been refurbished or newly constructed. An example of this is the former Continental Hotel, located on the Centerville square.

Golda Meir, who had been Israel's prime minister until the previous year, finished second.

However, the Hellenic stereotype of barbarians was not a universal feature of Hellenic culture. Xenophon, for example, wrote the "Cyropaedia", a laudatory fictionalised account of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian empire, effectively a utopian text.
