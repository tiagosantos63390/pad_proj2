In September 2006 the DMTF launched the CDM Health Management Initiative to, for the first time, unify the computer industry on a single interoperable, secure, and functionally rich interface to diagnostics programs on multi-vendor computer systems. CDM is based on the Common Information Model (CIM) and Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) standards as pioneered by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). The CDM Health Management Initiative brings together the vast resources of the DMTF including: Education, Development Tools, Interoperability, Technical Work Groups, and Marketing, to fundamentally improve the efficiency of the computer industry in delivering more advanced software solutions as well as to directly decrease the cost of datacenter management. Via CDM technology, hardware suppliers will no longer need to develop unique diagnostic solutions for their various customers, IHVs will trim diagnostic development investment, independent software vendors will benefit by having a single vehicle to deliver adaptive software systems, and original equipment manufacturers will benefit by having an improved level of support from their vendors.

Young sharks can be found in shallow inshore environments such as bays until at least three years of age, suggesting this species uses these sheltered habitats as nurseries. As the sharks grow older, they venture farther from land into deeper water, more and more often, until they eventually disperse. This is a long-lived, slow-growing species; males grow faster and reach a smaller ultimate size than females. Sexual maturity is attained at around long and 12 years of age for males, and long and 13 years of age for females. The maximum lifespan is at least 26 years for males and 30 years for females.
