On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from locals. Michael Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being “neutral from the conflicts of others". He called on border residents to “stand beside their army and assist its members.” Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.
Sometimes this company also does post-production for some Bollywood or other films made in another region of India that are already shot in the same language during the acting stage that this studio is dubbing, but for some reasons. Sometimes certain actors can't convey their voices to certain tones, accents or dialects well enough due to either temporal health issues, certain conditions that prevents actors to transmit through their roles, or by all means of disusing their voices. That is why dubbing artists are hired by being called-in to dub for corresponding actors to resolve the solution, depending on how the director wants it to be, whenever that film needs to be into the process of ADR or not.

Greg Hassell of the "Houston Chronicle" said "Westbury Square wasn't his only accomplishment, and it certainly wasn't his most profitable." Gerry Berne said "building Westbury Square was the most creative thing he was ever involved in. It was personal. It was a romantic thing for him." In 1999 Hassell said "many newcomers to Houston are unaware that it's even there" but that "the very mention of Westbury Square is enough to elicit a smile from longtime Houstonians." According to Gray, as of 2012, Westbury Square "provokes fits of nostalgia in old-time Houstonians."
