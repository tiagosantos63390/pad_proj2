Two theories explain the origin of the name "Rivière à la lime":

The law was named after two Flemish deputies, Juliaan De Vriendt and Edward Coremans, who proposed the law. The law decreed equal validity for legal texts written in both French and Flemish, as well as decreeing bilingual signage in Flanders. As a result, the passing of the law meant that henceforth all laws were voted, passed and published in legally equivalent French and Flemish versions. The law followed a period of greater official acceptance of Flemish, starting in around 1886 when coins became bilingual. The law's passing, along with the introduction of universal (but plural) manhood suffrage in 1893, caused the Flemish Movement to enter a "third stage" of mass-membership.
