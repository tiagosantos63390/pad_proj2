Whereas "hypokrisis" applied to any sort of public performance (including the art of rhetoric), "hypokrites" was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure.

This negative view of the "hypokrites," perhaps combined with the Roman disdain for actors, later shaded into the originally neutral "hypokrisis." It is this later sense of "hypokrisis" as "play-acting", i.e., the assumption of a counterfeit persona, that gives the modern word "hypocrisy" its negative connotation.
