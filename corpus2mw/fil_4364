During the early 1900s, reconstructions of subfossil lemurs were poor interpretation due to misattributions of postcranial bones. Although other paleontologists had begun correcting misattributed bones and issues of synonymy, Lamberton fixed more misattributions and poor interpretations of subfossil lemur remains than any other paleontologist. In 1947, he correctly identified the postcranial remains of the sloth lemur, "Palaeopropithecus", which Guillaume Grandidier had mistakenly attributed to a giant tree sloth he called "Bradytherium". Ten years later, in 1957, he wrote a crushing rebuttal to Italian paleontologist Giuseppe Sera by pointing out many skeletal misattributions and tactfully refuting his misinterpretation of the koala lemur ("Megaladapis") as a ray-like swimmer and his fancifully creative "arboreal-aquatic acrobat" theory for "Palaeopropithecus". Both Lamberton and British paleontologist Alice Carleton showed that "Palaeopropithecus" was suspensory; however, Carleton proposed that "Palaeopropithecus" was sloth-like, while Lamberton predicted locomotion more similar to that of an orangutan. It wasn't until the late 1900s that subfossil discoveries demonstrated that "Palaeopropithecus" was more sloth-like.
