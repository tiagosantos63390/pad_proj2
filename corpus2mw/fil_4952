Background.
The Washington Boulevard route received a significant boost when, on January 27, 1933, Arlington County, the NCPC, and the United States Department of War reached an agreement on rights-of-way along the route. The agreement gave the county a right-of-way across Fort Meyer and the southwestern tip of Arlington National Cemetery and another right-of-way from the cemetery to Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway across War Department land. The agreement absolved the War Department from expending any funds on the road construction project, and committed the NCPC to seek a $35,000 appropriation to construct the road from the cemetery to the parkway.
