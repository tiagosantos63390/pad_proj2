John Meldrum was in poor health when he resigned his post at Yellowstone in 1935. In October 1935 he left the park to visit relatives in Wyoming and Denver, CO. He arrived in Denver in January 1936 to spend time with his niece, Miss Susie A. Meldrum. On February 24, 1936 he learned of the death of Yellowstone superintendent and personal friend, Roger W. Toll, in a New Mexico traffic accident. He did not take the news well, became very depressed and died the morning of February 27, 1936. John W.

Although the original forty shilling freehold suffrage of 1432 applied to freehold rather than leasehold, it had been widened gradually over the centuries, increasing the number of loopholes by which faggot voters might register. Edward Porritt found the earliest instances of faggot voting in the 1620s under Charles I. The Parliamentary Elections Act 1695 (7 & 8 Will. III c.25) prohibited subdivision of tenements for this purpose. In the eighteenth century, a freehold would be conveyed to the faggot just before the election, and back again straight after the vote.

The ballet was later introduced to London in 1906 with choreography by François Ambroisiny and a shortened score by Messager himself. He used this shortened version when the piece was revived at the Paris Opéra in 1912, and it was published as a final version. A one-act version was choreographed by Albert Aveline at the Opera in 1919 and it was not until 1942 that the role of Pépio was finally danced by a man.

Dr. Philip "Phil" Myman (Jonathan Slavin) is an emotionally sensitive man who is also one of the laboratory scientists in Veridian's Research Department. He is usually working or hanging out with Lem, who works with him on almost every project. He generally does whatever he can to be accepted and avoid conflicts. He is married, and makes frequent references to his unseen wife (similarly to Maris Crane from "Frasier"), who, based on Phil's comments about her, appears to despise him. In season 2's episode 6, "Beating a Dead Workforce", we learn she was a member of Mossad. Despite having a spouse, he seems to harbor a hopeless crush on Veronica. In "The Lawyer, the Lemur, and the Little Listener", he reveals to Linda that, long ago (presumably before he was married), during a summer job he had driving a meals on wheels van, he met a "sexually adventurous" 73 year-old woman, who "roughly" took his virginity.

The fuselage was a monocoque wooden structure, flat sided but with a rounded top running from above the cabin to the tail. The cabin seated four in two rows; the two forward seats had dual control and behind them was a carrier for food and a folding table on the starboard side. There was also a refrigerator. Behind the rear seats was a panel with sliding door access to a starbord side toilet The corresponding port-side space was a baggage compartment accessible only from outside. Entry to the cabin was via an over-wing port side door. The tail unit was a cantilever structure with the tailplane an integral part of the upper fuselage, carrying endplate fins with straight swept leading edges above the tailplane and rounded below. The fixed surfaces were plywood skinned, but rudders and the elevator were fabric covered. These control surfaces had in-flight adjustable trim tabs.

A Fade spirit of Justice who accidentally possessed the body of the dead Grey Warden, Kristoff, after being forced from the fade with the rest of the party by a Pride demon and taking hold of the nearest vessel.. During the course of the game Justice undergoes arguably the most evolution as a character. He begins as a benevolent spirit that aspires to Justice as its only attribute, knowing and caring little for the world outside the fade beyond viewing everyone who does inhabit it with condescending pity. As the player journeys with him, he begins to experience the Kristoff's memories, and after a particularly distressing visit from the late Kristoff's wife he starts questioning his identity. If the player chooses to help Justice track down Kristoff's wife he will resolve that whatever time he has left will be spent fighting to protect the love and beauty he has discovered in the material world.

Halle-Neustadt (popularly known as HaNeu, pronounced Ha-Noi) was a city in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) . It was established as a new town on May 12, 1967, as an independent and autonomous city. The population in 1972 was 51,600 and in 1981 was more than 93,000.
