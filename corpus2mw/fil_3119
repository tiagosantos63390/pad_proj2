Within only two years, via the theatres in Zittau, Kamenz and Freiberg, Saxony, and the "Lobe-Theater" in Breslau, he obtained an engagement at the "Burgtheater", and arrived in Vienna in 1874 to take it up. A week before his 20th birthday he gave his first performance there as Didier in Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer's "Die Grille".
