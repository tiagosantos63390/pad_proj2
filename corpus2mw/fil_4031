Just as Montauk Highway was realigned along the north side of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road between East Patchogue and Brookhaven to divert through traffic away from Historic Bellport, Frowein Road was transformed into the Moriches Bypass, partially to divert truck traffic and through traffic away from historic sections of Moriches, Center Moriches, and East Moriches, New York, as well as the low railroad bridges in Moriches and East Moriches. Since the road runs along the north side of the LIRR tracks, it served as a more convenient route to Center Moriches Station until the Long Island Rail Road closed that station on March 16, 1998. East Moriches Station was also closer to Frowein Road, but that station was closed by the LIRR two years before Suffolk County upgraded the road.
