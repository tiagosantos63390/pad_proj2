Bappa Mazumder brought up in a musical family. As both of his parents were musicians, he did not need to go outside to learn music. He got his early learning from his family. Later he took a five-years course in classical music at Monihar Sangeet Academy, a music school established by Ustad Barin Mazumder. 'However, I don't feel my training in classical music is adequate and that's why I haven't pursued that genre of music' as he mentioned. He started his career as a Guitarist in LRB. He played with almost all the famous musicians in his early career. He came up as a singer for the first time in 1996 with his debut album named "Tokhon Bhor Bela". After that he has released nine studio albums and produced more than 200 albums, so far.
