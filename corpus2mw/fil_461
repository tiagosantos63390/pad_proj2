One of the best known portrayals of Jersey on the small screen was the BBC's crime drama - "Bergerac", featuring John Nettles as Jim Bergerac as a policeman in "Le Bureau des Étrangers" (a fictional department, based on the real "Bureau des Étrangers", for dealing with non-Jersey residents). This was filmed mainly in Jersey, but storylines increasingly moved further afield to England and France.
Akins's first single was "What They're Talkin' About", a No. 35 on the "Billboard" country charts in late 1994, followed by the No. 36 "I Brake for Brunettes". After these first two singles came his signature song, "That Ain't My Truck". This was his breakthrough hit, peaking at No. 3 on the country charts in mid-1995. All three of these songs were included on his 1995 debut album "A Thousand Memories", which also produced the No. 17 "She Said Yes". Also in 1995 and 1996, Akins toured with Reba McEntire.
