In adult literature, Donnelly has written two detective books for Piper Verlag: "Kein einziges Wort" and "Wen der Tod entlässt". Both books star a German-Austrian female funeral parlor owner with a fondness for tango. For unknown reasons, critics have mainly ignored these books. ORF is planning a TV series based on the books. "Für Paare verboten", published by Hoffmann und Campe, is a caricature of the tantra therapy scene. Donnelly has also written an amusing travel guide "Gebrauchsweisung für Mallorca" (2002). "Das Glasauge" (Donnelly's autobiography), "Wendelburgs Komplott" and "Die Hühnerleiter ins Nirvana" are books-on-demand also available as e-book.

The language border separating the Germanic and Romance "Sprachräume" moved over the centuries which preceded the establishment of the Belgian state over an area between the Ardennes and the more or less straight line going from Aachen to Calais on the one hand and the much less populated frontier from Aachen to Arlon via Malmedy. However, this frontier has not much changed since the 18th century. For example, in the communes of Mouscron-Comines-Warneton, French seems to be dominant at least since 1761. The frontier splitting the older province of Brabant and the Hesbaye moved regularly during the 17th and 18th centuries. Some communes, such as Hélécine, switched from Dutch to French and others, such as Herstappe, switched from French to Dutch. The Voeren have a long Flemish tradition and, in the Land of Herve, several communes which used to use Germanic dialects switched to French during the 18th century, as for example, Berneau and Warsage, both now part of Dalhem and Saint-Jean-Sart, a hamlet of Aubel.
The 1864 Camden Expedition was part of a two-pronged strategy by the Union Army to drive Confederate resistance out of southwestern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, and pentetrated into Confederate Texas. Union Major General Frederick Steele led a Union force from Little Rock on March 23, 1864, with the objective of joining forces with Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks at Shreveport, Louisiana. Confederate forces in Arkansas were directed from Washington, where the Confederate government of the state relocated after the fall of Little Rock. Confederate Major General Sterling Price ordered Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke to harry the Union column and to prevent it from crossing the Little Missouri River as it moved toward Washington. Advance Union forces established a beachhead on the south side of the Little Missori on April 3, and clashed with Confederate defenders in the Battle of Elkin's Ferry. The outnumbered Confederates were forced to withdraw, and General Price established a defensive position, lightly fortified by earthworks, on the road between Elkin's Ferry and Washington at the western edge of the sparsely-populated Prairie d'Ane, a roughly circular area of prairie surrounded by woodlands. General Steele delayed his advance toward Washington until April 9, awaiting the arrival of addition troops from Fort Smith.

The Short Creek Community (known as the Woolley Group before 1935) was one of the original expressions of Mormon fundamentalism, having its origins in the teachings of Lorin C. Woolley, a dairy farmer excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1924. Woolley taught that, shortly after having received the 1886 Revelation on plural marriage, LDS Church President John Taylor had set apart five men, including himself and his father John W. Woolley, to ensure that the practice of polygamy would continue into perpetuity even if abandoned by the Church. To that end, Woolley extended the same apostolic authority to a seven-man "Council of Friends" between 1929 and 1933.
Janae is characterised as not being "very good at rational thinking" so she attempts to end her relationship with Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh), in order to protect him. Taylor-Cotter revealed that she was thankful that Boyd "sees straight through it" and agrees to support her. Janae also confides in her younger sister Bree but is reluctant to tell anyone else. Janae "approaches it the best way she knows how and that's by pushing everyone that cares about her away." Taylor-Cotter told "Inside Soap" that Janae cannot tell Janelle about her situation because "she fears she'll judge her". The truth is revealed during an argument between the pair. Taylor-Cotter and Feeney got on so well off-screen, that they purposely avoided each other while on set to add to the "intensity" of the scenes. Janae is "so afraid of taking after her mother" that she blames Janelle for her predicament, telling her that she is at fault if she is HIV positive. Janelle is upset that Janae could not confide in her about an "important matter". Taylor-Cotter said that Janae ends up receiving support from her family because "the Timmins clan always reunite in the end".
