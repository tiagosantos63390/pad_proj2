The Vortixx are a species from the island of Xia, where females dominate males. They have little moral regard for life, having turned their island into an industrial nightmare through the production weapons and military supplies to sell to anyone who pays them well, resulting in acid grass and sky raining fire. When the Vortixx began to charge excessive prices, the Brotherhood of Makuta was forced to step in, and Makuta Mutran and Icarax were dispatched to the island. The Vortixx's refusal to comply eventually resulted in Icarax destroying a portion of the island, after which the Vortixx became more willing to negotiate. Meanwhile, Mutran left behind a sentient rock on the island by accident, which eventually grew to be intregal in Vortixx society after it consumed enough victims to become a mountain. At some point in their lives, Vortixx were offered the chance to complete the trial of climbing the Mountain. Vortixx will attempt to climb in pairs, and will be rewarded a higher station by returning together. However, those who return from the Mountain after abandoning their partner are given an even higher status for displaying ruthlessness, and are allowed to leave the island if they wish. Only one Vortixx has been named in the series, Roodaka, former Viceroy of the Visorak horde, now a prisoner of the Order of Mata Nui after she double-crossed both the Brotherhood of Makuta and the Dark Hunters.

In 1819 the Metropolita of Ioannina Gabriel visited the communities which suffered from the disease, and in the town he met 160 inhabitants. In a letter of Ath. Psalidis dated 12-2-1823, sent to Movrokordatos, he described the situation of the Epirus and Tessally, under the Turkish occupation, showing an armed struggle for liberation. It reports that in the town of Dobrinovo where people live, they were able to carry weapons. The town of Dobrinovo in that period used the school separated for the boys and the girls and was constructed using the aqueduct that brought water to the town and bridges that opened new roads. The inhabitants of Dobrinovo travelled a lot and became traders, but they did not forget their town and they contributed for its development. The Greek newspaper published in Constantinopolis, speaks about 1200 inhabitants in the town of Dobrinovo. Unfortunately for the town, there followed a period of economic decadence. The Balkan wars in 1912, then the First World War, blocked the trade activities that the Iliochorites had created with the countries like Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, until Russia. Later with the arrival of the Spanish flu pulled down on all the towns including Dobrinovo (Iliochori) with numerous victims.
