In the foreword, Gygax writes about the genesis of the rules:
Chimnaji was magnanimous in victory, and surviving Portuguese were given a safe passage from the city. Legends also speak of his emulating Shivaji by returning with honor a woman of Portuguese governor’s household who was presented to him as a spoil of war. Portuguese were given eight days to take all their movable property and move out. Accordingly the last remnants of Portuguese army and administration pulled out of Vasai by 23 May 1739.
He joined the Bradford Bulls in the European Super League from the 2009 season.

In quantum computing, the Gottesman–Knill theorem is a theoretical result by Daniel Gottesman and Emanuel Knill that states that an important subclass of quantum circuits, called stabilizer circuits, can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Stabilizer circuits are circuits that only use gates from the normalizer of the qubit Pauli group; this is referred to as the Clifford group, though this has nothing to do with the Clifford algebra.

After the British government's plans to implement a three-strikes policy for file sharing copyright infringement, Allen came out in support for disconnecting repeat offenders. Creating a blog titled ""It's Not Alright"" against file sharing, it subsequently came to light that she had copied text directly from the Techdirt website of an interview with 50 Cent, without attribution. This led to an exchange on the World Wide Web, which culminated in accusations being made that Allen had infringed on other artists' copyrights by creating mix tapes early in her career, that she then made available via her website. A group of supporters of filesharing launched a denial of service attack dubbed Operation Payback that shut down Allen's website and targeted other critics.

According to Buddhist theory, it is the intention (motivation) behind an action, rather than the outward appearance, that determines the effect. For example, if the outward appearance of an action is benevolent, yet the intention behind the action is based in greed, anger or hatred, then the fruit of those actions will bear testimony to the fundamental intention that lay behind them and will be a cause for future unhappiness.
