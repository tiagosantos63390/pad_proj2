The candidacy of radical trade union organizer Eugene V. Debs for President of the United States in 1900 on the ticket of the Social Democratic Party of America inspired Titus and brought him to the next chapter of his diverse life story. After becoming the State Organizer of the Social Democratic Party of Washington in the summer of 1900, Titus launched Seattle's first explicitly socialist weekly newspaper on August 12 under the simple and direct title "The Socialist." A total of 500 tabloid-sized copies were printed at a cost of $13. The first editorial office of the publication was the basement of Social Democratic Party headquarters, located at 220 Union Street in Seattle.

The Broad Mountain Wind Energy Center was a proposed wind farm planned for construction on the slopes of Broad Mountain in West Mahanoy and Butler townships in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The first phase of the project was blocked by legal action in the Courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, though initial funding was allocated, and would have included 8 Gamesa 2MW Wind Turbines that were planned to have been operational in late 2011. Phase two of the project will include 27 additional 2MW wind turbines. 
Already on the second day of the convention it was speculated that the "band of four", four libertarian-leaning members of Parliament, considered leaving the party. The four were Oscar D. Hillgaar, Roy Wetterstad, Ellen Christine Christiansen and Stephen Bråthen. The alternative to leaving the party was to mark themselves as dissenting party members. On the third day, news surfaced that the four had talked together. In the news program "Dagsrevyen" on 17 April, the band of four stated a desire to follow the 1993 party platform and not later resolutions. They were met by a demand from Carl I. Hagen that they continue on the "terms laid down by the national convention or find something else to do". He later added that if the band of four left the parliamentary group, they should "scram". To sum up, he said that the libertarians, which were known to be a minority, had gained too much influence, and was set back by the national convention. Øystein Hedstrøm demanded that the four leave the party. Because of the fierce personal antagonism at the convention, it was dubbed as the "national convention at Dolkesjø"—derived from "dolk", the Norwegian word for dagger.
"Her bow with its concave waterlines and the greatest breadth at a point considerably further aft than had hitherto been regarded as practicable, was a radical departure, differing not merely in degree but in kind from any ship that preceded her. One critical observer declared that her bow had been turned " outside in," and that her whole form was contrary to the laws of nature."
