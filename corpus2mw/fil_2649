Background.
Andrew was a seminal member of U.S. Thugs, where he gained the name 'Champion' when he had rushed to get a tattoo for the crews' original name (The 'East Bay Champions'). He was the only one to get the tattoo prior to the final selection of U.S. Thugs as the crew's name (Lars went to the tattoo shop in San Francisco but didn't have enough money to get the tattoo by Daniel Higgs of Lungfish fame). He was also one of the first four to get the original U.S. Thugs tattoo from Eric Hogan in Sacramento. Eric and Andrew had been friends from when Eric had lived in Alameda and Oakland years before. The name Champion however stuck as Andrew's stage name from then on and to this day people still use it. He later had a falling out with one of the members of U.S. Thugs and had his tattoo covered but stands by his friends who are still involved.

Vibro gained superhuman powers due to his nuclear-powered seismic energy-absorbing apparatus being grafted to his body; this apparatus has been transformed into a vibrational energy generator. Vibro has the ability to generate high-level seismic vibrations and fire them from his hands as vibratory or concussive force, causing shockwaves, opening chasms, and/or generating earthquakes. He also has the ability to harness the thrust of his vibratory force emissions for flight at subsonic speeds, and he has the ability to generate shields of vibratory force around himself. Vibro has immunity to the effects of his own powers.

A study of the Mali Empire’s military is really a study of Mandinka military culture. The Mandinka were early adopters of iron in West Africa, and the role of blacksmiths was one of great religious and military prestige among them. Manipulation of iron had allowed the Mandinka to spread out over the borders of modern-day Mali and Guinea by the 11th century. During this time, the Mandinka came into contact with the Soninke of the formidable Wagadou Empire. The Soninke formed the first major organized fighting force in West Africa, and the Mandekalu became a major source of slaves for the empire. To combat Wagadou’s slave raids, the Mandekalu took refuge in the mountains between Kri and Kri-Koro around Niagassala. There they used the high ground that

The office was abolished on the conquest of Athens by the Peloponnesians in 404 BC. The Hellenotamiae were not reappointed after the restoration of the democracy; for which reason the grammarians give us little information regarding their responsibilities and duties. The German classical scholar Philipp August Boeckh, however, concluded from inscriptions that they were probably ten in number, chosen by lot (like the treasurers of the gods) out of the "Pentacosiomedimni", and that they did not enter upon their office at the beginning of the year, but after the Panathenaea and the first "Prytaneia". With regard to their duties, Böckh supposes that they remained treasurers of the monies collected from the allies, and that payments for certain objects were assigned to them. In the first place they would of course pay the expenses of wars in the common cause, as the contributions were originally designed for that purpose; but as the Athenians in course of time considered the money as their own property, the Hellenotamiai had to pay the "Theorica" and military expenses not connected with wars on behalf of the common cause.

The edit of 1783 invited persons of either gender and of the Roman Catholic faith to Trinidad who would swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown to receive land allotments in sizes depending on their race and heritage. Specifically, it granted of land to each Roman Catholic who settled in Trinidad and half as much for each slave that they brought. 16 acres (65,000 m²) was offered to each free person of color, or "gens de couleur libre", as they were later known, and half as much for each slave they brought. The effect of the cedula was immediate, as what had once been a small colony of 1000 in 1773 had boomed to 18,627 inhabitants by 1797.The Cedula of Population of 1783 laid the foundation and growth of the population of Trinidad.
