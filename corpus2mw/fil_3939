Deadalus requests Gabriam’s presence to display the nanobot’s immense potential, enhancing NEW-GEN’s landscape and revitalizing the world’s plant life. Gabriam expresses his gratitude and commends his apprentice’s vision, and Deadalus retorts that if he is truly appreciative, he will allow him to use their discoveries to heal his sick wife, Kallius. Gabriam refuses, claiming the nanobots aren’t stable enough for human trials, and past experimentation on Kallius have progressed her condition. As they quarrel, Deadalus is alerted that his wife has taken a turn for the worse. He rushes to Kallius’ side where she bids him farewell and asks him to look after their infant daughter, Carmen. Once again, Deadalus begs his mentor to intervene, but it’s too late. Mourning his loss, Deadalus becomes consumed with grief and resentment toward Gabriam.

Though the JMC had been unwilling to sell its land in 2004, by December 2009 the entire mountain was put up for sale, for $500,000. Before 2009, the assessed value of the property was only about $50,000. In early March 2011, the Open Space Institute (OSI) offered to purchase the propertywhich had, by that time, been reassessed at $240,000for $185,000, and sell it to the town for $85,000. The deal would create an easement with the town, allowing only noncommercial use of the mountain while preserving the municipal parking lot at its base. While some government officials viewed such an acquisition as a permanent solution to the hamlet's parking problems, other officials viewed the loss of tax revenue from the privately owned property to be undesirable.

Prizes are promotional items—small toys, games, trading cards, collectables, and other small items of nominal value—found in packages of brand-name retail products (or available from the retailer at the time of purchase) that are included in the price of the product (at no extra cost) with the intent to boost sales. Collectable prizes produced (and sometimes numbered) in series are used extensively—as a loyalty marketing program—in food, drink, and other retail products to increase sales through repeat purchases from collectors. Prizes have been distributed through bread, candy, cereal, chips, crackers, laundry detergent, margarine, popcorn, and soft drinks. The types of prizes have included comics, fortunes, jokes, key rings, magic tricks, models (made of paper or plastic), pin-back buttons, plastic mini-spoons, puzzles, riddles, stickers, temporary tattoos, tazos, trade cards, trading cards, and small toys (made from injection molded plastic, paper, cardboard, tin litho, ceramics, or pot metal). Prizes are sometimes referred to as "in-pack" premiums, although historically the word "premium" has been used to denote (as opposed to a prize) an item that is not packaged with the product and requires a proof of purchase and/or a small additional payment to cover shipping and/or handling charges.

At the front of the DB-10 the thick aerofoil centre section stretched unbroken between the engines, which were mounted upon it. Beyond the engines outer wings of normal thickness and constant chord, significantly thinner and narrower than the inboard section, were each supported by a pair of parallel struts to the lower edge of the centre section. Wing spars and struts were made of steel tubing, with duralumin ribs. A conventional, rectangular section, fuselage with duralumin longerons emerged from the centre section as the thick aerofoil thinned, carrying a tailplane on its upper surface, braced from below. It also carried a single fin and a deep rudder, which moved in a cut-out between the elevators. All surfaces, except those housing the uncowled Gnome-built Bristol Jupiter radial engines, were fabric. The DB-10 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with each single, partly cowled, mainwheel mounted on a parallel pair of V-shaped struts behind the engines. The outer pair of struts was fixed close to the lower ends of the wing struts, at the edge of the thick aerofoil. A tailwheel was mounted at the rear of the fuselage, just in front of the rudder.
In fall 2007, the city of Huntsville tried to destroy the playground to increase the area for more tombes and graves. This was done over the night, the following morning the playground had been torn away and the area destroyed. But a public outcry made the plans to stop and new equipment were installed. The disturbance had no effect on the hauntings on the playground. In 2012, The Alabama Paranormal Association inspected the area of the playground and obtained Electronic Voice Phenomena recordings of children's voices, as well as, video of the swings in motion. In 2008, the Alabama Paranormal Society inspected the area of Dead Children's Playground. One of the investigators managed to capture either a female or a female child on photo.
As Vale slipped down the table, they were denied permission by the Ministry of Labour to sign USA international Willy Roy as he did not meet the two-year residential requirement. More trouble came when Bo'ness United reported the club to the Scottish Junior Football Association for an alleged breach of the rules in the transfer of Roddy Georgeson. On the pitch results continued to go against the Vale, as they found themselves in a re-election struggle by January. Vale then went on a club-record six consecutive away games without scoring a goal in a run lasting from 8 January to 9 March. In came left-back John Ritchie from Whitley Bay, though free agent Graham Barnett did not return to the club, despite protestations from supporters – the management stated that Barnett's wage demands were too great. For the clash with bottom-placed Bradford City on 12 January, Vale assembled the youngest ever Football League forward line: Alex Donald (17), Roddy Georgeson (17), Mick Cullerton (17), Paul Bannister (18), and Paul Ogden (19). Of the five forwards only Bannister had played competitively before. Bradford won 2–0. A 2–1 win over Rochdale was then followed by four straight defeats. Cummings and Morrison were judged not to have made the grade and so were released form their contracts, signing with Ayr United and Sligo Rovers respectively.
