The bridge remained unchanged until 1901 during the American Colonial Era when the bridge was widened to accommodate more pedestrians and vehicles, even with the construction of nearby Santa Cruz Bridge that was started in 1900. With the addition of additional lanes of traffic, as a result, the street lamps on the bridge were removed. In 1905, tracks were laid on the bridge to accommodate the "tranvias", a streetcar system that ran throughout Manila.
