Nielsen moved to Auckland for the 2013 New Zealand Warriors season, also the first for the club's new Australian coach Matthew Elliott.
In 1967, following the Six-Day War, the association inaugurated the Givatayim Observatory in the city of Giv'atayim in the center of Israel. Giv'atayim was the choice of preference due to the height of the place allocated for the observatory, far above the sea level and in distance from its humidity (relative to the surroundings at the time). The observatory was established with the funds of the municipality of Giv'atayim, the association and donations from abroad raised by the observatory manager at the time, Eng. Yossi Fooks. For 25 years the observatory was solely managed by the association. Dince 1994 it had co-management with the municipality of Giv'atayim. The chairmen of the association were sometimes the managers of the observatory at the same time. Among them: Haim Levi, Dr. Noah Brosch (presently the director of the Wise Observatory of Tel Aviv University), Dr. Isaac Shlosman (presently Astrophysics Professor at the University of Kentucky), Ilan Manulis (presently the director of the Technoda Observatory) and Dr. Igal Patel who is the chairman of the association as well as manager of the observatory for over 20 years (ever since 1987).
