Sammy the Frog - James Rankin (Seasons 1-5). Sammy is a laid-back frog who has a love for playing the saxophone. Sammy is typically on the sidelines, commenting on the adventures of Dudley's and the others. However, Sammy also frequently acts as a mentor to Dudley and the kids. Sammy is typically the first one to feel that something bad is going to happen, and often warns Dudley (whom he often refers to as "Big Green") about getting into trouble. In "Have Yourself a Crabby Little Chrstimas", it is revealed that Sammy is Jewish. Sammy has a Spanish-speaking cousin named Yammi, who appeared occasionally, though never in any scenes with his cousin (most likely due to the fact that James Rankin performed both characters). Sammy's debut was in the series premiere, and his last appearance was in the second-to-last episode "Lullaby Dragon". In the short-lived French version of the series, he was renamed "Ti-Louis".
In 2004, the election was conducted by majority vote.
