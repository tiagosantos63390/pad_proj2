At the beginning of 2004, Milito moved to Italian second division club Genoa. After two very successful seasons, where he scored 33 goals in 59 matches in Italy, Genoa were relegated down to Serie C1 as a punishment for an alleged match-fixing case in the final match of the 2004–05 season. Due to this, Milito was forced to leave Genoa and would ultimately join his brother Gabriel at Real Zaragoza in the Spanish La Liga.
One of his masterpieces, and not reflective of the style of his canvases, is the airy fresco in Palazzo Pitti, where on order of Ferdinando II de' Medici, between 1639–1642, Furini frescoed two large lunettes depicting the "Platonic Academy of Careggi" and the "Allegory of the Death of Lorenzo the Magnificent". The frescoes can be seen as a response to Pietro da Cortona, who was at work in the palazzo during these years (Cantelli 1972). 
As with most of Blake's poetry, there are several critical interpretations of "London". The most common interpretation, favored by critics such as Camille Paglia and E. P. Thompson, holds that "London" is primarily a social protest. A less frequently held view is that of Harold Bloom; that "London" primarily is Blake's response to the tradition of Biblical prophecy.

From 1990 to 2000, Bavetta regularly refereed playoff games and was ranked at the top among referees in terms of performance evaluation. In 2000, he was one of the highest-paid referees in the NBA, earning over $200,000 a year. Among those playoff games included Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, in which Bavetta ruled that a three-point basket made by Howard Eisley of the Utah Jazz was released after the shot clock buzzer sounded and thus would not count. However, television replays on NBC showed otherwise. Bavetta's career was threatened when he was accidentally hit in the nose by Pacers forward Jalen Rose, who was trying to punch Knicks center Patrick Ewing during a 1999 game between the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks. Bavetta did not leave the game immediately, opting to wait until later in the day to have surgery. He returned the next day to officiate a New Jersey Nets game.

CR 577 begins at an intersection with Route 124 in Springfield Township near the western terminus of Route 82. The highway originally started further south, at the intersection of Broad Street and Springfield Avenue in Westfield; Broad Street and eastbound Springfield Avenue are CR 509, while CR 577 went west and north on Springfield Avenue, which becomes Meisel Avenue as it enters Springfield. This route was changed in the past from CR 577 to CR 509 Spur (although the old signage was often left intact) but may have been changed back. In downtown Springfield, where most of the major streets are one-way, Maple Avenue carries the nominal route northbound to the official southern terminus, while Meisel Avenue carries the southbound traffic.
