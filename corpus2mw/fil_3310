Stieglitz retained his title with a hard-fought unanimous decision over his Mexican challenger Enrique Ornelas, Andrade's younger brother, at the Freiberger Arena in Dresden. It was a slow start of both fights and little less action but Stieglitz started this fight in style in the second round. The German champion progressed the fight with his sharp jab to give Ornelas some trouble but the Mexican also landed some precise and dangerous shots towards Stieglitz.
