In "", Apocalypse was first mentioned in a single episode of the second season of the animated series. The last half of the third season focused on the battle to stop Apocalypse from rising, and he became the main antagonist for the fourth and final season of the series. He was voiced by David Kaye. In the series, Apocalypse possessed vast powers that were never well defined. However, he is consistently depicted as having unmatched telepathic and telekinetic prowess, easily overcoming the combined forces of the X-Men and Magneto's Acolytes with no visible effort. Even drained he is able to defeat Xavier through his puppet Mesmero.
