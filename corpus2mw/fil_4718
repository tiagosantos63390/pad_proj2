On December 15, 2011 Meckler was arrested at New York's LaGuardia Airport and charged with criminal possession of a weapon, a felony under the gun laws in New York. While checking baggage for a flight to Detroit, Meckler presented a Delta Airlines agent with a locked case containing ammunition and an unloaded Glock 27 pistol. He had a permit to carry the weapon in California. Meckler was unaware that his gun license was not valid in New York, which has strict gun laws. Meckler was released following arraignment. A spokesman for the Port Authority Police said Meckler "had a misunderstanding of the law. He had a permit to carry in California." An attorney for Meckler said Meckler was "in temporary transit" through New York and the gun was "lawful" and in a safe approved by the Transportation Security Administration. After the incident, Meckler said he believed his constitutional rights had been violated. He subsequently plead guilty to an infraction of disorderly conduct, in order to avoid trial on charges which carried up to a fifteen year prison sentence. He was sentenced to a $250 fine, and the pistol was destroyed.
