After a year or so as a garage band named Episode Four, the Kelly brothers were joined by Johnny Wood (guitar/vocals) in 1984 and Spencer Smith (drums) in 1985, during 1986 they recorded the "Strike Up Matches" EP released as a 500 only pressing on the Lenin and McCarthy imprint that year . By 1987, the band had renamed themselves East Village and relocated to London where they recorded two EPs for Jeff Barrett's Sub Aqua label, before it folded in 1989. They also toured extensively, playing a support tour with The House of Love in 1988 and two tours with McCarthy. The collapse of Sub Aqua left the band without a deal, and they recorded their debut album using money donated by Bob Stanley, a friend of the band and an admirer of their work. The record was label-less for some time until Jeff Barrett (who was setting up the fledgling Heavenly Recordings) picked up on it and paid for its completion. A series of Heavenly label based gigs with The Manic Street Preachers, Saint Etienne and Flowered Up ensued, followed by a new single, "Circles", in 1991. The band played a sold out show at the New Cross Venue in South London but ended the set by splitting up on stage. The album, "Drop Out" (1993), was mixed and released posthumously on Heavenly. A collection of all the band's early singles (along with unreleased demos), "Hot Rod Hotel", was released on the Australian label Summershine in 1994, giving the band a radio hit with "Silver Train".

Sutcliffe retired from the Met Office in 1965, but did not end his career. Noting the lack of university-level education in meteorology in the UK, he founded a new meteorological department at the University of Reading, offering Britain's first undergraduate course with meteorology as its principal subject. He retired from academic life in 1970, and died at Cadmore End in 1991.
