"GATE" was ported to the Macintosh in 1994 by Jörg Kienzle with graphics designed by Valérie Kienzle. The game requires at least 4MB of RAM and runs on 68k or PowerPC Macs running an operating system between OS 6.0.7 and OS 9.2.2. Besides playing the game in either English or French, players can also choose German or Kanji in this version. It is hard drive installable and requires 4.5 MB of disk space. Although it was initially released by Seven Hills Software, Jörg Kienzle made it available as shareware in 1996.
The 1946-47 team had won 19 games, and all five of its starters returned this year, including forward Andy Kostecka, a star of the 1942-43 team and – after World War II military service – of the 1946-47 team. Hopes were high that the 1947-48 squad would take the Hoyas back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1943, when Ripley had coached them to the national final in their only tournament appearance thus far. The team won its first six games, with Kostecka averaging 22 points per game during the first four, one of which was an overtime win over St. John's at Madison Square Garden in New York City - Georgetowns only win over the Redmen in 17 games played between 1931 and 1973. Kostecka suffered a leg injury in the fifth game, against Virginia Tech, and missed the sixth and seventh games of the season.
