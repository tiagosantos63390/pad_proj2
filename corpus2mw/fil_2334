A GRD (rasGAP-related domain) follows the IQ domain. This domain is highly similar to the functional subunit of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and was thus thought to have GAP function. IQGAP1 does bind Rho GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, however, IQGAP1 is unusual in that it actually has no GAP function, and instead stabilizes the GTP-bound proteins in their active state.

Slaves in America had many musical traditions that became important to the music of the country, particularly jazz. The work song was one of these traditions, an improvised system of singing based on the idea of call and response, a central aspect of African music. There were also several instrumental improvisation techniques that were used: after work was done, these people would hold musical performances in which they played on pseudo-instruments made of washtubs and other objects newly used for musical purposes, and also played rhythms on their bodies, called "pattin' juba". The only area that slaves were allowed to perform their music, other than private locations, was a place in New Orleans called Congo Square.
