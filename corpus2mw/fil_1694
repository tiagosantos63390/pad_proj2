The most important task that faced the Radoslavov government in its foreign policy following the Treaty of Bucharest was to secure a loan that could provide the funds needed to pay the financial coast of the Balkan Wars, develop the new territories and continue paying a government debt of over 700 million golden leva. The difficult task was entrusted to the Foreign Minister Nikola Genadiev and the Finance Minister Dimitar Tonchev who were first dispatched to France, which held a considerable chunk of the Bulgarian public debt and from which Bulgaria had usually obtained loans before the Balkan Wars. The French refused due to Russian pressure, despite that the Bulgarian representatives were ready to accept certain unfavorable conditions and that French banks were simultaneously granting loans to Serbia, Greece, Romania and the Ottoman Empire. In October Tonchev managed to secure a short-term loan of 30 million leva from Austrian banks but the sum was far from sufficient. In February the Bulgarians again turned to France and were met with unacceptable conditions.
