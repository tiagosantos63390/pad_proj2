On the Nagara River where Japanese cormorants ("Phalacrocorax capillatus") are used by the fishermen, the fishing season draws visitors from all over the world. The Japanese cormorants, known in Japanese as "umi-u" (ウミウ, "sea-cormorant"), are domesticated birds trained for this purpose.

Melody of Oblivion has a very distinctive soundtrack featuring prominent virtuoso violin by Hijiri Kuwano and acoustic guitar solos and other classical-style music. The music was composed and arranged by Yoshikazu Suo and Hijiri Kuwano. The theme music is titled "The Spirit of Flamenco". There are also more disturbing synth and amplified guitar pieces during scenes of creeping horror. The show itself is also full of musical references, from the Melos Warriors' given names (Kurofune Ballad being the most obvious) to the Italian musical vocabulary which flashes on the Melos Warrior 'targeting interface' during battle ("animato", "con fuoco", "passionato", "energico", etc.).

Many male Holsteiners have names beginning in the letters "C" or "L" due to the dominance of male lines perpetuated by Cor de la Bryére, Cottage Son xx, and Ladykiller xx.

A positive working capital cycle balances incoming and outgoing payments to minimize net working capital and maximize free cash flow. For example, a company that pays its suppliers in 30 days but takes 60 days to collect its receivables has a working capital cycle of 30 days. This 30 day cycle usually needs to be funded through a bank operating line, and the interest on this financing is a carrying cost that reduces the company's profitability. Growing businesses require cash, and being able to free up cash by shortening the working capital cycle is the most inexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target's working capital cycle because it provides them with an idea of the management's effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flow.
