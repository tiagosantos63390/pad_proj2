William has sudden shooting pains in his legs, indicating kidney failure. House, rubbing his leg and taking more Ibuprofen, irritably orders them to check William's apartment, despite the fact that William has not been there in weeks. Foreman and Taub confirm that William's liver is filled with what appear to be tumors but when they magnify them on the scanner, they cannot identify it, but it does not appear to be cancer. Thirteen and Chase check out William's apartment, they find a sanctum dedicated to the black arts in a locked room. They bring his books and potions back to the hospital but confirm that the potions are not a poison. House notices that the figures from the model are lead and proposes lead poisoning as a diagnosis.
