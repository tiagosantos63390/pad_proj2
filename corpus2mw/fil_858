The four biggest production studios produced most of the notable films of Philippine cinema during this era. In 1951, the movie "Roberta" of Sampaguita Pictures which featured leading child stars was the hit. LVN Pictures, under the leadership of the Doña Sisang de León, not only specialized in super productions, rural comedies and musicals, but also produced socially-relevant films such as Avellana's "Anak Dalita" (1956), Tony Santos's "Badjao" (1957) and Manuel Silos's "Biyaya ng Lupa" (1959).
