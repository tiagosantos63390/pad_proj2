After graduating from university Norbury entered the legal profession and was called to the Irish Bar in 1770. In 1781 he was appointed a King's Counsel. Norbury was returned to the Irish Parliament for Tralee in 1773, a seat he held until 1780, and later represented Philipstown between 1783 and 1790 and Gorey from 1790 until the Act of Union in 1801. In 1789 he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, which he remained until 1798 when he was promoted to Attorney-General for Ireland and sworn of the Irish Privy Council. In his role as Attorney-General he was responsible for the prosecution of those involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. According to The Dictionary of National Biography "his indifference to human suffering … disgusted even those who thought the occasion called for firmness on the part of government". In 1799, he brought forward a law which gave the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland power to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act and to install martial law.

The origins of Chilean cinema can be traced back to the start of the twentieth century in the port city of Valparaíso, when the first film ever fully produced in Chile was launched at the Teatro ODEON on 26 May 1902. The film, "Ejercicio General del Cuerpo de Bomberos" (General Practice of the Fire Department), was only three minutes long and showed the annual public show performed by the Valparaíso Fire Department in the city's Aníbal Plaza. Nothing is known of the film's director, cinematographer or production team, and only 27 seconds of footage remain today, held by the Catholic University of Valparaíso.
