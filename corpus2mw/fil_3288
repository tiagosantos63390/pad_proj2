The tall earthfill embankment dam was completed by the Talent Division of the Rogue River Basin Project, impounding Dry Creek. Two canals were also built, diverting water from nearby Antelope Creek and Little Butte Creek. A boat ramp, four pit toilets, a picnic area, and a parking lot were also built.
