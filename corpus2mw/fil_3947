Possibly the best evidence of Treasure’s intense focus and competitive nature came from golf. He took up the game at the age of 50, becoming an active member of Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club – and within five years, with RMS professional David Talbot, he had become good enough to compete in the State Express 555 National Pro-Am Championship at Penina in Portugal. He holed a 40-footer on the 18th green to draw level with the leaders, and the pair went on to win the play-off; at the winners' press conference, Treasure revealed that he had dreamed the night before that he would win with just such a putt, provoking the Daily Mail headline "Prophetic Prof Sinks Dream Putt". Good publicity was in his nature.
