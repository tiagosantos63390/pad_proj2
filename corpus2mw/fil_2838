Combat Medics must put themselves in greater harm than many other roles on the battlefield. In the type of asymmetric warfare which typifies modern conflicts, the enemy often has no respect for the laws of war and may in fact actively target medics (in addition to officers and radio operators), for the significant value they have in keeping the unit combat-effective.

A rifle or carbine is standard, often augmented with a sidearm because the medic may have to pass his rifle off to his patient or fellow warfighter in order to treat the wounded.
