The Pikes Peak Ringers is a community handbell choir based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The group was established in 1991 by its director, Kevin McChesney, to provide an outlet for advanced ringers and to create performances that showcase the instrument of handbells with the highest quality presentation and musicianship. The group has performed a variety of styles of music – classical, traditional, pop, jazz, new age, contemporary and original – and has developed a unique and influential style of visual as well as musical presentation. In addition to performances throughout the state of Colorado and the western United States, the Pikes Peak Ringers have been the featured group at several national handbell choir events, have been involved with publishers in providing promotional recordings of new releases, and have recorded five studio CDs and produced two performance DVDs.

Top 10 is 100 percent traceable to the item level and exceeds the Case level traceability recommended by the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI). The brand makes items sold under the label traceable by assigning each produce item with a unique 14-digit number issued by GS1. When that produce item goes in a case, that case is also assigned a 14-digit number. The brand shares those 14-digit numbers with all of the grower's trading partners. Both the items and the cases have barcodes with the 14-digit numbers and other more specific information encoded into them. These barcodes can be scanned and tracked using the same system that is endorsed by the Produce Traceability Initiative, using software available from numerous specialized software vendors.

The EP was dubbed as a 'bonus album' by the singer herself. It spawned one single, "Sooner or Later" which became a minor commercial hit, peaking at #93 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and #46 on the US "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart. "Everything Comes and Goes" was intended to be released as a full album consisting of 13 tracks, including a duet with Dwight Yoakam on a song titled "Long Goodbye". However, due to changes at Warner Bros. Records, the album's release date was pushed back multiple times and ultimately was released as an EP. Several intended album tracks from the original record, including "Long Goodbye", "Texas In The Mirror" and "Take a Chance On Me", were later released individually as free downloads for a limited amount of time. On a live webchat to fans on May 26, 2011, Branch revealed a previously unreleased track from "Everything Comes and Goes", "Through the Radio" would be included on her new studio album "West Coast Time" as a hidden track.
