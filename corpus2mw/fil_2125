Early life.
Walter Addiego of the "San Francisco Chronicle" said, "this love letter to man's best friend will make dog fanciers roll over and do tricks. It's so warmhearted, you'll want to run out and hug the nearest big, sloppy mutt." The praise continued with Carrie Rickey of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" awarding the film three out of four stars and saying, ""Marley and Me" operates on the assumption that happiness is a warm tongue bath. And those who endorse this belief will enjoy this shaggy dog story . . . The anecdotal structure does not make for a gripping movie. For one thing, there's no conflict, unless you count the tension between a guy and his untrainable pooch. Yet "Marley" boasts animal magnetism . . . Mawkish? Sometimes. But often very funny and occasionally very moving."
