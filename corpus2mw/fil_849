Hapoel (Hebrew: הפועל, lit. "the worker") is an Israeli sport association. It was established in 1926 as a union of the Histadrut, and represented the workers class. During the British Mandate of Palestine period it had a bitter rivalry with Maccabi and organized its own competitions, with the exception of football, the only sport in which all the organizations played each other.
A particular "Stern & Gerlach" experimental pattern run in a precise configuration (i.e. with a specific relative orientation between the "green" apparatus and the "red" one) generates a flux of discrete information whose distribution function over a given set of values (e.g. "high", "low") is stable, reproducible at will, valid for any experimentator. The distribution function is a property of the experimental pattern. Running the experimental pattern results in a measurement of the distribution function. It creates knowledge about a property of the experimental pattern. It adds value if considered within the framework of a theory about experience, about "what it means to be the Actor of an experiment in the world".

At the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of Salonica (Thessaloniki) to Marseille and later to Paris, where Edgar was born. He first became tied to socialism in connection with the Popular Front and the Spanish Republican Government during the Spanish Civil War. When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Edgar fled to Toulouse, where he assisted refugees and committed himself to Marxist socialism. As a member of the French Resistance he adopted the pseudonym "Morin", which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the French Communist Party in 1941. In 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in Landau, where he served as a Lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

Judge John Cleves Symmes, a land speculator from New Jersey, initiated much of southwestern Ohio's settlement and in late 1795, he sold Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory, General James Wilkinson, Israel Ludlow and New Jersey Congressman Jonathan Dayton the land that became known as the "Dayton Purchase." The four men paid $0.83 an acre for 60,000 acres (240 km²) at the confluence of the Great Miami and Mad rivers. Israel Ludlow named the village after his friend Jonathan Dayton, who ironically never set foot in the town. Ludlow also laid out the streets, which at four poles (66 ft) were wide enough to "turn a coach and four." Daniel Cooper headed the team that surveyed the land and laid out the town site in 1795.

Kabbabish ("goatherds": James Bruce derives the name from "Kabsh", sheep, Arabic : كبش ), a tribe of African nomads of Semitic origin. It is perhaps the largest "Arab" tribe in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and its many clans are scattered over the country extending SW from the province of Dongola to the confines of Darfur. The Kabbabish speak Arabic, but their pronunciation differs much from that of the true Arabs. The Kabbabish have a tradition that they came from Tunisia and are of Mogrebin or western descent; but while the chiefs look like Arabs, the tribesmen resemble the Beja family. They themselves declare that one of their clans, Kawahla, is not of Kabbabish blood, but was affiliated to them long ago. Kawahla is a name of Arab formation, and J. L. Burckhardt spoke of the clan as a distinct one living about Abu Haraz and on the Atbara. The Kabbabish probably received Arab rulers, as did the Ababda. They are chiefly employed in cattle, camel and sheep breeding, and before the Sudan wars of 1883-1899 they had a monopoly of all transport from the Nile, north of Abu Gussi, to Kordofan. They also cultivate the lowlands which border the Nile, where they have permanent villages. They are of fine physique, dark with black wiry hair, carefully arranged in tightly rolled curls which cling to the head, with regular features and rather thick aquiline noses. Some of the tribes wear large hats like those of the Kabyles of Algeria and Tunisia.

In the early Middle Ages the Diocese of Cambrai was included in that part of Lotharingia which at first had been allocated to the West Frankish king Charles the Bald by the Treaty of Meerssen of 870 but, after various vicissitudes, came under the rule of the German king Henry the Fowler in 925. After the revolt by Duke Gilbert of Lorraine collapsed at the Battle of Andernach of 939, Louis IV of France renounced the Lotharingian lands, and in 941 Henry's son and successor King Otto I of Germany ratified all the privileges that had been accorded to the Bishops of Cambrai by the Frankish rulers. 
McFly and Bedouin Soundclash have also covered the song on Radio 1's Live Lounge. More unusual cover versions have included a choral version from The Cheshire Chord all female choir and a salsa version (Predigo un alboroto) from The Swanvesta Social Club. The song was also covered by Girls Aloud on their 2006 "Chemistry" arena tour. They changed the lyric "borrow a pound for a condom" to "borrow a pound for the bus home", which the band appeared to take offence to. Furthermore, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band covered the song on their 2007 reunion album "Pour l'Amour des Chiens". In 2006, New Zealand radio broadcaster "The Joint" mixed excerpts from financial analysts Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert's radio programs to produce a version of the song reflecting the trillions of dollars of derivatives in the shadow banking system which they correctly predicted would cause a financial meltdown. In 2011, Irish pop group Westlife performed the song as part of their medley for their Gravity Tour.
