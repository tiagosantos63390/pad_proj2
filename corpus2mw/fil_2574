Following Night of Champions, the Raw brand did not have a top-tier championship belt, as Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand and took the WWE title to the program. On the June 30 episode of "Raw", Edge made an appearance, causing Batista to show up and beat him down. Shortly afterwards, Edge lost the World Heavyweight title to CM Punk, after Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract, making the World title exclusive to the Raw brand, once more. Punk would lose the title at Unforgiven, after he was unable to compete in the title match at the event, following an attack backstage by Randy Orton. The match was won by Chris Jericho, who was named as his replacement. The ECW Championship was made exclusive to the ECW brand, following Mark Henry's win at the event. Henry, however, lost the title to Matt Hardy at Unforgiven in September. Triple H dropped the WWE title at Survivor Series.
