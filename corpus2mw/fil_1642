At home, Cassie berates herself for wasting her team's time, but then realizes the significance of the Andalite toilet; it's proof that sentient life exists beyond Earth, and that Visser Three needed humanity to know as little as possible in order for the invasion to continue to run smoothly. Cassie then remembers a pin-up board for 'Gondor Industries'; a dummy corporation employee's day out. Cassie takes the Animorphs to The Gardens amusement park. Cassie figures that Visser Three plans to kidnap captain Torelli and other Air Force staff at Zone Ninety-One. The Animorphs, chased by Captain Torelli, end up in the horror house, where the Hork-Bajir wait. The children morph, and a battle ensues. They wound the Hork-Bajir and rescue the captain from Visser Three. The Yeerks escape in their vessels, in front of totally oblivious humans at a night parade.

Prior to the album's release, Randy Lewis of the "Los Angeles Times" predicted that it could give T.S.O.L. their shot at radio airplay: "Even more than its predecessor—1984's "Change Today?" LP—"Revenge" is a driving, often provocative work that shows the group's musical base extending beyond mere punk thrash. Although a couple of up-tempo tunes prove that the band can still muster blasts of raw punk power, blazing guitar work and the raging, Jim Morrison-like intensity of Wood's vocals on 'No Time' and 'Memories' would fit comfortably alongside hard rock and heavy metal on album rock stations." Bradley Torreano of Allmusic remarked that with "Revenge", "a general poppiness began to creep into [T.S.O.L.'s] sound that was more along the lines of the hard rock scene that was growing around them. Still, excellent tracks such as 'Nothin' for You' still displayed an edgy obsession with dark sounds and moods."
