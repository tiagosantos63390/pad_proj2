In 2001 WGSM was sold to K Communications for $2.5 million. The format was changed to Korean language programming. Over the next few years, WGSM spent a lot of time on and off the air. In 2004, a Korean group was contacted by two local radio broadcasters, to lease the station. The two met in his Flushing broadcast center, and presented a proposal to Kwon and two associates to lease the station---then still known as WGSM, to flip it to country, with a secret formattics (A blend of Country-Rock) to be confidential until the station was announced operational again. The station was playing Korean language and music. The station was then sold to Win Radio Broadcasting Corporation and changed call letters to WNYH on 1 September 2005.

These codon changes which can occur due to A to I editing at these sites can lead to a maximum of 32 different mRNA variants leading to 24 different protein isoforms. The number of protein isoforms is less than 32 since some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. Another editing site, site F has also been located in the exon complementary sequence (ECS) of intron 5. The ECS required for formation of double stranded RNA structure is found within intron 5.


Landslide dams are responsible for two types of flooding: backflooding (upstream flooding) upon creation and downstream flooding upon failure. Compared with catastrophic downflooding, relative slow backflooding typically presents little life hazard, but property damage can be substantial.

But after struggling with record labels for years Stevie Rachelle decided to form his own for the band in 1994. Tuff was first signed in 1990 by Atlantic Records. The band was then picked up by IRS Grand Slamm Records in early 1993. The label folded in less than a year with the end of the mother label IRS Records which distributed Grand Slamm. Tuff were without a label again. In early 1994, Rachelle officially started RLS Records. The initials had a dual meaning. The first was "Record Labels Suck" & the second was "Rachelle's Lyrics & Songs". The offshoot Cheezee Records was formed in 1996 to be the home for the singer's side project Cheeseheads With Attitude.

In the 1950s the Framingham heart study led by Dawber revealed the correlation between high blood cholesterol levels and coronary heart diseases. Following up from that study the researchers explored a novel way to lower blood cholesterol levels without modifying the diet and lifestyle of subjects suffering with elevated blood cholesterol levels. The primary goal was to inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis in the body. Hence HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) became a natural target. HMGR was found to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. There is no build-up of potentially toxic precursors when HMGR is inhibited, because hydroxymethylglutarate is water soluble and there are alternative metabolic pathways for its breakdown.

Cullin 1, also known as CUL1, is a human protein and gene from cullin family.

By this time, the defensive works that had protected the Confederate capital had crumbled. The First Lady—after being indisposed during much of her visit to City Point—had returned to Washington; and her husband had joined Porter in the Admiral's flagship, "Malvern". About mid morning on the 4th, "Bat" got underway to follow "Malvern" and "River Queen" up the James toward Richmond, as those ships threaded their way along a channel cleared of mines and obstructions. When "Malvern" ran aground a short distance below the Confederate capital, Porter invited the President into his barge, in which they were rowed ashore. Barnes followed in a boat from "Bat" and accompanied Lincoln when he visited the Southern executive mansion—from which President Jefferson Davis had just fled—and during much of his subsequent tour of the burning city. That evening, Lincoln and Porter reembarked in "Malvern" and Barnes in "Bat". The next day, Mrs. Lincoln returned from Washington to the James; and, after she had visited Richmond on the 7th, plans were laid for the First Family's voyage back to Washington.

At that date he is found back in Scotland as a full bishop attending a church council at Linlithgow. His activities and whereabouts as Bishop of Dunblane are not well attested. In 1404 the Pope mandated Fionnlagh as well as Henry de Wardlaw, Bishop of St Andrews, and Robert de Cardeny, the Bishop of Dunkeld, to preach a crusade against the Turks. He was at Dunblane on 29 November 1406, witnessing a charter of the Duke of Albany; he is next found on 18 July 1408, at a church council of the church held at Perth, and then again on 28 October that year witnessing another charter of the Duke of Albany.
