At the end of the 2007–08 season, which saw Tottenham finish 11th in the Premier League, the club announced the signing of Croatian playmaker Luka Modrić and reiterated that any club wishing to sign their Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov would need to offer more than £30 million. Tottenham's transfer movement began immediately with Czech goalkeeper Radek Černý moving on a free transfer to QPR following the end of the season; Černý's loan deal had expired and was not offered a contract extension by Tottenham nor his parent club Slavia Prague. Little under a month later, Tottenham agreed a deal with Barcelona for 19-year-old Mexican forward Giovani Dos Santos for an initial fee of £4.7 million. Not long afterwards, Tottenham reached a deal with Dutch club PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, valued at around £8 million.
