Candlestick Lane is the name for a neighborhood in eastern Urbana. This neighborhood consists of Grant Place and adjacent properties on Fairlawn and Eastern Drives. It is called Candlestick Lane because every year the residents decorate their yards for Christmas with a lot of lights and figures. The tradition began in 1961 (maybe 1960) as a house-decorating contest sponsored by the Illinois Power Company. The neighborhood used its prize money to purchase electric candlesticks for each home. The City of Urbana installs special red and green street signs, reading "Candlestick Lane" and "Grant Place" during the Holiday season. The lights are turned on from around 5:00 to 10:00 p.m. from the third Saturday in December through New Years Day.

Paxton is the home of the "Illinois Central Historical Society", a railroad depot historic preservation group that centers on the history of the Illinois Central Railroad. Due to Paxton having the highest elevation points in the area, the Illinois Central dug out ground so that the railroad could move at the same elevation, but underneath the city of Paxton. When the railroad was cut (around the 1920s), several bridges were built across the railroad to connect the east and west sides of Paxton. Presently, there are three vehicular bridges, which are located at Holmes Street, Pells Street and Patton Street. There is also a pedestrian bridge at Orleans Street. The vehicular bridges at Pine Street and Center Street and the long-abandoned pedestrian bridge at Franklin Street were removed in the spring of 2010.

Brooks was also the first postmaster and the first grain dealer. Early growth of the town was very rapid and by 1870 Chatsworth had 1,493 people. The first hotel was the Cottage House built by Samuel Patton. Soon a newspaper, the "Plaindealer", was being published. In 1879 a second railroad, the "Kankakee and Southwestern," passed through the town and was given a right of way down Second Street. In 1887 the town rendered aid in the train accident known as the Great Chatsworth Train Wreck. Telephone service came in 1883 and an electric light plant was built in 1894. In March 1924 seventy to one hundred men arrived in town to work on a paved highway, at first known as the Corn Belt Trail, which soon became Route 24 and formed an important east-west route across Illinois.
