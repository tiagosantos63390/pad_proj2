The Brain is a 1962 film directed by Freddie Francis. It stars Anne Heywood and Peter van Eyck. A UK-West German production (also released as "Ein Toter sucht seinen MÃ¶rder") "The Brain" differs from earlier film versions of the Curt Siodmak novel "Donovan's Brain": in this remake, the dead man seeks his own murderer, through contact with the doctor keeping his brain alive.
