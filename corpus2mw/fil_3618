"A. parthenope" is smaller and less colourful than the "Anax imperator". In general appearance, especially when seen on the wing, "A. parthenope" is similar to "A. imperator" but "A. parthenope" tends to hold its abdomen straighter than "A. imperator". A large dragonfly seen in flight with a bent abdomen is most likely to be "A. imperator" rather than "A. parthenope". "A. parthenope" has a blue saddle at S2 and S3 which can be seen in flight which is in contrast to the rest of the abdomen which is brown. There is a yellow rin at the base of S2. The eyes are green. It is similar to "A. ephippiger" although "A. ephippiger" is slightly smaller and slenderer and its blue saddle does not wrap around S2 but is mostly blue on top. "A. ephippiger" has brown eyes.
