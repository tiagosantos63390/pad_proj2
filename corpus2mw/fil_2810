From then on Chambers trained more regularly and enjoyed quite a lot of success at O.T.F.A. (Ontario Track and Field Association) meets. At the beginning of the '93 high school track season Chambers was preparing himself with Guthrie for the first of three possible senior boys 100's, as he was only in grade 11 at this time. But the Catholic separate school board had a "work to rule" strike and as a result Chambers' school did not send athletes to O.F.S.A.A.

James Christopher's alcoholism began when he was a teenager. He had originally sought help in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but was uncomfortable with the emphasis on God and religion and he began looking for direction in the writings of secular humanists. Christopher wrote about his frustrations with AA and his own developing program for recovery. In 1985, "Free Inquiry" published an article "Sobriety Without Superstition" written by Christopher. He received hundreds of letters in response and decided to organize secular, self-help, alcoholism recovery group meetings. The first such meeting was held in November 1986 in North Hollywood, California, and meetings continue to this day at the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles and at other locations. Christopher has been continuously sober since 1978.

Catherine Cadière was born to a merchant, whose health was ruined by the plague in 1720, and lived under the guardianship of her mother and brothers. She was interested in mysticism and religion, and became deeply influenced by the Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Girard (1680-1733), whom she met in 1728. She was encouraged to the belief that she suffered from holy convulsions and saintly stigmata and spiritual visions by Girard, who presented it to be the symptoms of a saint. He visited her often, and possibly abused her sexually. Her emotional state during these experiences was described as hysterical.

Long term effects of this displacement and repurposing linger in the refugees, their families and subsequent generations, effectively reshaping the cultural and economic dynamic of an entire society. This has a ripple effect on their culture and people for generations to come. The use and conservation of a resource is a direct link to conflicts in Africa According to Abiodun Alao, author of “Natural Resources and Conflict in Africa”, natural resources can be linked to conflicts in three different ways: either a direct or remote conflict is caused by the resource, or a natural resource can fuel or sustain conflicts, and lastly when resources have been used to resolve conflicts. Often, the conservation efforts that commandeer indigenous people’s land remove the natives from a familiar social environment and transplant them into unknown quarters and customs. By doing so, traditional values such as “songs, rituals, …and stories” could be entirely lost in little more than one generation’s progression (Dowie, 2005). Economically, relocation and displacement can be devastating on a personal and communal level. Indigenous peoples of all intra-culture class types are forced to the boundaries of the new parks, stripped of their homes and status, and sometimes made to live in “shabby squatter camps…without running water or sanitation” (Dowie, 2005). This leads to even more added tension between conservation administrators and the new conservation refugees.

The Digital Quran is the electronic version of the Qur'an, introduced as early as 1993. There is a strict code of conduct for handling the written Qur'an, which limits its accessibility, especially in situations such as traveling or everyday reading on the move. The invention of the Digital Qu'ran addressed these limitations, in particular due to the on-screen text feature. While some limitations still apply, the portability of the device meant that people could read and listen to the Qur'an in places and situations where it had previously been impossible to do so.
