"Stone Cross Windmill" was built in 1876 by Stephen Neve, the Warbleton millwright. The towe was built by Thomas Honeysett, a local bricklayer and fitted out by Neve with machinery supplied by the Phoenix Iron Foundry, Lewes. Two sails were blown off in 1925. It was working by wind until 1937. The mill was used as an observation post during the Second World War. In January 1962, planning permission was granted to convert the mill into a house. Mr Ron Hall, the owner of the Mill House, bought the mill and outbuildings, and decided to restore the mill instead of converting it to residential use.
