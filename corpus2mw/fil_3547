Particularly for high-priced, advising-intensive products such as cars or insurance, there are often queries via telephone. The calls happen relatively far along the click chain and, in some cases, they even speed up the purchasing process. Telephone tracking plays an important role in assigning these calls and the profit generated by them to an advertising channel. In addition, the significance of the call can be mapped in the purchasing chain and its position can be determined. If one takes conversion chains, to use an example, that contain a call, it becomes evident that usually this call occurs immediately preceding the profit. At the same time, it can be determined whether the shopping basket content tends to be greater when a customer has called in previously, or if the conversion chain is shorter in cases of caller participation, as the purchasing security of the customer is increased. These and other analyses are possible by means of telephone tracking and lead to a new assessment of the telephone as a channel and thus the marketing measures in this area.

After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny added more land mass by accretion that occurred from the south. A few hundred million years later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.

The week after the "NXT" season finale, Tarver and the rest of the season one "NXT" rookies interfered in the main event match between John Cena and CM Punk on "Raw", attacking Cena, Punk, the announce team, and the ring announcer Justin Roberts, before dismantling the ring area and surrounding equipment turning heel in the process. On the June 14 edition of "Raw" the rookies (excluding Daniel Bryan) attacked General Manager Bret Hart, when he refused to give them contracts. The following week on "Raw", Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced the hiring of a new General Manager, who had signed the seven season one "NXT" rookies to contracts. The following week the group was named The Nexus. On the July 12 episode of "Raw", The Nexus competed in their first match together, without Darren Young, defeating John Cena in a six–on–one handicap match. The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam which saw the return of former Nexus member Daniel Bryan, who aligned himself with team WWE. Tarver was the second person eliminated from the match when he was pinned by John Morrison, and The Nexus went on to lose the match. On the October 4 episode of "Raw", Tarver was attacked by Cena, with Barrett later stating that he would have thrown Tarver out of The Nexus anyway. This storyline was put in place due to Tarver sustaining a groin injury.
