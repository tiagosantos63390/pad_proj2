The introduction of Lib Tech’s Banana Technology marked yet another departure from orthodox snowboard design. Traditionally, snowboards are built with camber—the gentle arch formed in between the board’s contact points when placed on a flat surface. Camber geometry was first introduced for skis, which each have only one central area of pressure input (i.e., under the skier’s boot). Snowboards, however, have two areas of pressure input (i.e., one under the front boot, and one under the back boot), leaving the rider unable to efficiently depress the center of the snowboard, an effect which Lib Tech’s Pete Saari calls the “dead zone.”

Thom Merrick is known for creating formally challenging works in different media with a keen awareness of art history. Making a name for himself early in his career, he created works, paintings, sculpture and installations, by reacting to the immediate environment with industrial materials and simplified forms, or whatever material was at-hand. From the late 1980s to the late 1990s he created his works on-site, in situ to the exhibition hall. These works aim to break down the boundary of artistic identity, production and requisite classifications. In short, Thom Merrick’s art is uncanny—he creates spare and non-repetitive works that are abbreviated; each part reveals a complex code of a contemporary art practice, that is self-critical, adjudicating what is and is not.
East Morton has a Public House called the Busfeild Arms named after the local Busfeild family who lived in the area in the 19th Century, hence the apparent misspelling of the name.

Adud then returned to Baghdad, where he built and restored several buildings in the city. He also stopped the quarrel between the Dailamites and Turks of the Buyid army. In 982, a Byzantine envoy arrived to the court of Adud al-Dawla, where they negotiated peace with him, and also agreed to make mention his name in the Friday prayer in Constantinople. The vizier of Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, Sahib ibn Abbad, is known to have said the following thing about this event: "he al-Dawla has done what no kings of the Arabs nor any Chosroes of the Persians could - he has Syria and the two Iraqs, and he is close to the Despot of Byzantium and the Maghribi by his continuous correspondence."

Liturgical drama or religious drama, in its various Christian contexts, originates from the Mass itself, and usually presents a relatively complex ritual that includes theatrical elements. Until the Late Middle Ages it is the best recorded tradition of religious drama, and is assumed to have been the root from which other forms such as the civic mystery plays, as well as poorly recorded travelling companies, grew. The number of surviving scripts is small, and many performances are only known about from entries in payment records and the like.

Both rode on a pair of three-axle trucks with all three axles on each truck powered; this is a C-C wheel arrangement. These trucks have an unequal axle spacing due to traction motor positioning; the outer two axles on each truck are closer together than the inner two. The RSD-7 used the GE 752 traction motor. The six-motor design allowed better tractive effort at lower speeds.
