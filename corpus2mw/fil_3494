By July 1801, Dale's force had begun to run low on water. In order to replenish his supplies, Dale dispatched the schooner USS "Enterprise", commanded by Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, to provision at the British naval base on Malta, while the commodore himself remained off Tripoli with the frigate to maintain the blockade. Soon after leaving the blockade, "Enterprise" came upon what appeared to be a Tripolitan cruiser sailing near her. Flying British colors as a ruse, the "Enterprise" approached the Tripolitan vessel and hailed her. The Tripolitan answered that she was seeking American vessels. At this the "Enterprise" struck the British colors, raised the American flag, and prepared for action.
