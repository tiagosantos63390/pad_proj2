"Anna Karoline" is marked by various repairs and changes which makes it possible to study how the vessel has developed. She was originally clinker built and without a deck covering her cargo hold. In 1890 "Anna Karoline" ran aground at Kirangrunnen and subsequently towed to Trondheim where the outer hull was planed and smooth cravel skin was added. Thus one can today see that the vessel has both clinker hull and cravel hull. "Anna Karoline" got new owners in 1903, they installed a 16 hp engine.
