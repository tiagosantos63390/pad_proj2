The Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland remained in power from 1972 to 1989, first under the leadership of Frank Moores then from 1979 to 1989 under Brian Peckford. Peckford's agenda was characterized by battles with the federal government under Primer Ministers Pierre Trudeau and then Brian Mulroney. Peckford's later career became mired in a subsidized farming scandal, he retired from politics in 1989 and was succeeded by Tom Rideout. A month after becoming Premier Rideout's Progressive Conservative Party was defeated in the 1989 election by the Liberal Party under Clyde Wells, though the Tory's won a higher percentage of votes the Liberals won a majority of the seats in the House of Assembly. Wells' administration oversaw a tumultuous time in Newfoundland's recent history. Wells was involved in some confrontation with the federal government and the other provinces over the issue of the Meech Lake Accord which provided for distinct society status for the province of Quebec. He was also the premier when the federal government brought in a moratorium on year round cod fishing, a pivotal moment in Newfoundland and Labrador's recent history, ever since which outmigration and depopulation have been a perpetual problem. Furthermore, Wells ushered in a period of economic liberalization as he privatized government services.
