Let "B" be a ring and "A" a subring of "B" such that "B" is integral over "A". Then the annihilator of the "A"-module "B"/"A" is called the "conductor" of "A" in "B". Because the notion has origin in algebraic number theory, the conductor is denoted by formula_83. Explicitly, formula_84 consists of elements "a" in "A" such that formula_85. (cf. idealizer in abstract algebra.) It is the largest ideal of "A" that is also an ideal of "B". If "S" is a multiplicatively closed subset of "A", then
