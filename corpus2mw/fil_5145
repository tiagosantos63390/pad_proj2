The Vejjavatapada is derived from four passages from the Pāḷi Canon dating from between circa 5th and the 3rd centuries BCE, each of them attributed to the Buddha. The preamble contains two quotes from the Pali Canon, the first line of verse 204 of the Dhammapada, and from the Vinaya where the Buddha, after having attended to a sick monk neglected by his fellows, instructed his monks to care for each other when they are sick. Of the following articles the first five are based closely on a discourse in which the Buddha lays down the attitudes and skills which would make "one who would wait on the sick qualified to nurse the sick.". The final article is taken from the discourse in which the Buddha describes three types of patients according to their response to treatment; i.e. one who dies whether he gets proper treatment or not, one who recovers whether he gets proper treatment or not and one who recovers only if he gets proper treatment. In the case of this first type, he or she should still be treated and nursed out of compassion and just in case there is a chance, no matter how slim, of recovery.

History.
During the 1960s, the Parks Department intended to rebuild Crocheron Park, Bayside: this included the repair or construction of new tennis courts. The day before this answer was made, the Crocheron Park Tennis Committee issued a complaint that the courts were in a "deplorable state". According to a department spokesman, plans were in motion to renovated the park, claiming it would be unwise to renovate the park, claiming it would be unwise to resurface the courts, when they intended to rebuilt them. Israel Kaufman, a member of the Tennis Committee, said a 500-name petition was sent to Newbold Morris, asking for reapirs of the courts.
