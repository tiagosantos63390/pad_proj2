Some opponents of net neutrality argue that prioritization of bandwidth is necessary for future innovation on the Internet. Telecommunications providers such as telephone and cable companies, and some technology companies that supply networking gear, argue telecom providers should have the ability to provide preferential treatment in the form of tiered services, for example by giving online companies willing to pay the ability to transfer their data packets faster than other Internet traffic. The added revenue from such services could be used to pay for the building of increased broadband access to more consumers. Opponents to net neutrality have also argued that net neutrality regulation would have adverse consequences for innovation and competition in the market for broadband access by making it more difficult for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other network operators to recoup their investments in broadband networks. John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of Verizon, a broadband and telecommunications company, has argued that they will have no incentive to make large investments to develop advanced fibre-optic networks if they are prohibited from charging higher preferred access fees to companies that wish to take advantage of the expanded capabilities of such networks. Thorne and other ISPs have accused Google and Skype of freeloading or free riding for using a network of lines and cables the phone company spent billions of dollars to build.

Each round or race uses a standing start, as opposed to a rolling start as seen in other sports car racing series (except for a number of TC, TCA and TCB 2014 races, that will start with a rolling start). Each race has a maximum 50 minute time limit. In 2014, GT and GTS teams will begin the season at St. Petersburg (March 28–30) and compete across nine event weekends and 16 total races or rounds. TC, TCA and TCB teams will begin the season at Barber Motorsports Park and compete across seven event weekends and 14 total races or rounds.
