The Library's early years in the new building were characterized by disputes between the Library Commissioners and the city council. The Library's books and other materials provoked controversy, and candidates for public office made "political capital" of the fact that works such as The Decameron were available to borrow. Although the Library Commissioners refused to remove the criticized works, they were moved to a shelf in the librarian's office. On the other hand, the Commissioners refused to allow religious newspapers (such as "The Christian Science Monitor") on the shelves. (This policy was reversed around 1914.)

Schur said that this was due to state budget cuts and because the school was "trying to shift to more 21st-century jobs." Schur suggested that students in the program instead enroll in Advanced Placement courses in art history and studio art. According to Mr. Gonzales, the teacher of the auto-collision program, if the program is eliminated, there will be no schools in HISD that will offer it. Gayle Fallon, the president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, said that HISD was trying to push the vocational programs into the domain of Houston Community College. Gonzales and some of his students attended an HISD board meeting, asking the board to make the steps to have the program saved. As of 2011 the school continues to offer automobile collision/repair courses.
