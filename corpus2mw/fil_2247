Severe crop losses were reported. The primary agricultural damages were to plantain, banana, tomato and red onion crops. In some locations, production of such fruits was completely lost. Crop damage in the country totaled $77.7 million (2007 USD). Livestock losses were also reported. There was severe damage to 40% of water distribution, and 60% of 122 aqueducts. Due to health concerns and the onslaught of disease, some medical centers reached maximum capacity. In all, the storm caused at least 87 fatalities in the country, and 42 others were reported missing. Over 65,000 people were left homeless, and over 46 bridges were in some way affected by the floods. However, because many villages were isolated, these totals may not reflect the actual damage.
Brachydiastematherium transylvanicum (literally "short Diastema Beast of Transylvania") is the westernmost species of brontothere, with the first fossils of it being found in Transylvania, Romania. In comparison with other brontothere fossils, it is suggested that "B. transylvanicum" would have had an elongated head, not unlike "Dolichorhinus", and be about 2 meters at the withers (anatomically speaking, the highest part of the back at the base of the neck).
