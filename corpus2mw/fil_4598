According to some historical accounts, the conspiracy of Chao Pulai was instigated by Chaopang Banduk Borgohain, while others say that it was him, who had poisoned the king’s mind against Chao Pulai. But all agree that Chaopang Banduk Borgohain was the one to suffer, as he was dismissed from his office. His ultimate fate differ in different account, as some stated that Sukhrangpha had him executed for his crime while another account stated that Chaopang Banduk Borgohain escaped being put to death under the king’s orders by concealing himself until the affair had blown over and later he was subsequently forgiven and taken back into favour.
