After 1945 the new publisher removed "Nesthäkchen and the World War" from the Nesthäkachen series, because it was on the censorship list of the allied control boards. Ury was, like most German Jews, fiercely patriotic, and her descriptions of the events in and around the First World War were classified as glorifying war. Since 1945 the Nesthäkchen series has consisted of only 9 volumes. Steven Lehrer translated "Nesthäkchen and the World War" into English in 2006 and "Nesthäkchen in the Children's Sanitorium" in 2014. Ury also wrote other books and stories, primarily for girls and young women. German women still buy and read Ury's books, almost all of which are in print.

Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery (NFH) was constructed in 1975, making it one of the most recently constructed hatcheries in the federal system. With 70 hatcheries nationwide, Wolf Creek NFH is one of 14 hatcheries in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Southeast Region. The station currently produces approximately 1,000,000 rainbow, brown and brook trout annually. In cooperation with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, fish are stocked into over 100 different public fishing waters in the state. No private waters are stocked. Wolf Creek NFH is also working toward the recovery of several threatened or endangered species, including the Relict darter (endangered), Spotfin chub (threatened), and the Blackside dace (threatened). Visitation to the hatchery is over 100,000 annually.
