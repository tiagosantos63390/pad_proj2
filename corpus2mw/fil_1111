At the summit of Kippure is a 127m television and radio transmitter mast, the oldest television transmitter site in the Republic of Ireland. It was first identified as a transmitter site as part of a Radio Éireann survey into potential FM broadcast band radio transmitter sites in the mid-1950s. The Irish Board of Works built an access road to the site in 1959, and by the summer of 1961 the mast was erected. Television trade test transmissions followed, consisting of slide views of Ireland, a testcard, and the music of Count John McCormack.

Eight "chiburi" were then incorporated into the system. The basic "chiburi" used in both Toyama-ryū iaidō and Nakamura-ryū "battōdō" is actually an "en garde" position: the sword is snapped down, its point slightly elevated at knee level; from this position, one can maintain "zanshin" as well as convert easily to a thrust, should the need arise. Nakamura added seven more "chiburi", notably from Omori-ryū and Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū "kenjutsu".

Chile also maintains its own aviation industry, ENAER. The design of the T-35 Pillán trainer, based on the Piper PA-28 Dakota, is the best known example, seeing some export success as well. Furthermore, the assembly of the A-36/T-36 Halcón (CASA C-101) was achieved as well. Performing maintenance on most types in the current inventory, such as minor modifications on F-5E aircraft for example, the industry is of significant importance to the air force. ENAER is reported to be in talks with Embraer of Brazil to codesign the first indigenous South American military transport plane. Also, under the Pacer Amstel programme, with initial Dutch support, and later locally ENAER upgraded an F-16 combat jet, which for the Chilean Air Force is an advance for their maintenance of the F-16 fleet (becoming the 5th country to modify under authorization their jets).
Rae Alexandra of "Kerrang!" magazine, awarded the album an "excellent" four K! score. He wrote, "Make no mistake that Simpson and co are very serious about this. "Build an Army" lurches and rolls on enormous, sweeping riffs that the Deftones would be proud of. "Here Again (Last Conversation)" spins, splits, and stabs and wouldn't sound out of place on a Glassjaw album. The gargantuan sprawl of six-minute epic "Mono" showcases an awesome display of tunesmithery as it breathes and shifts from crescendo to crescendo. It really is difficult to find fault the Fightstar's music on any level. Unless, of course, your hell-bent on hating them for their frontman's former job." The magazines editor, Paul Brannigan would late commend the album as "one of the best British rock albums of the past decade". Andrew Kelham of "Rock Sound" magazine gave a score of 9/10 and described the album as, "a shockingly impressive debut that makes the naysayers look utterly foolish." He praised the band for maintaining a "fresh ground", despite wearing their influences on their sleeves. "After a delicate, Mogwai-tinged start, the album thrusts to life, unveiling anthem after anthem- "Waste a Moment" and "Build an Army" are feindish and addictive, while "Sleep Well Tonight" is an immediate classic. Soon you realise that there isn't going to be a dip in quality, and that's that: the past is rendered irrelevant and stupid, and Charlie's a bloody hero."
