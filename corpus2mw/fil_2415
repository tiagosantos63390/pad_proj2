Bacteria can be detected with a urine dipstick test for urinary nitrite or by urinary microscopy, although bacterial culture remains the most specific and formal test (the gold standard). Bacteriuria can be confirmed if a single bacterial species is isolated in a concentration greater than 100,000 colony forming units per millilitre of urine in clean-catch midstream urine specimens (one for men, two consecutive specimens with the same bacterium for women). For urine collected via bladder catheterisation, the threshold is 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre. The threshold is also 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre for women displaying UTI symptoms.
