Despite being part of the squad that travelled to Italy for pre season, Holt had to wait until the last day of the 2010–11 season to make his First team debut on 15 May 2011 as a substitute against Dundee United. His performance for the under 19 squad in the early part of the 2011–12 season earned him a new three-year contract extending his stay with the club until 2014. With Hearts in financial difficulty and wanting to bring through members of their under 19 squad into the first team, Holt was sent on loan to Raith Rovers to gain first team experience. He scored on his first start for Hearts away to St Johnstone in March 2012.
During Summer 2012 the first phase of the University Library redevelopment project was completed. In recent years the floors of the Library were upgraded to create a modern and vibrant learning space which is flexible, comfortable and accessible. During June 2012 the Jordanhill Library was closed and stock and services were integrated into this Library on the John Anderson campus. This project brought all Library and information services into a single location, delivering a one-stop shop to the users. There is a greater variety of learning environments offered, with more group study areas and improved silent study spaces. Relevant technology is now available throughout the building. Digital collections are continually being enhanced, opening hours are being increased and environmental conditions such as heating, lighting and ventilation have all been upgraded.

Cordovero, in his comprehensive systemisation of Medieval Kabbalah, had reconciled previous Kabbalists' opinions of the sephirot by describing each as Divine ohr ("light") invested in 10 spiritual keilim ("vessels"). This overcame the philosophical difficulty of Divine attributes, as in the Infinite Ein Sof prior to Creation, the sephirot were entirely nullified into non-existence in the simple unity of endless Divinity. They emerge as Divine attributes only from the perspective of creation, by combining two aspects of lights and vessels. The spiritual vitality, denoted as "light", similarly manifests in two levels of Ohr Sovev (transcendent) and Ohr Mimalei (immanent). First the light creates the vessels, then animates (fills) them. Only the vessels differ in each of their natures, while the light remains unified.
