The 1931 Michigan Wolverines football team compiled a record of 8–1–1. The only first-team All-Americans from the 1931 squad, center Maynard Morrison and end Bill Hewitt, did not return to the team in 1932. In September 1932, Kenneth Conn, the sports editor of "The Toledo News-Bee", wrote that Coach Harry Kipke had "sufficient reason to weep on every shoulder" as he faced the "stupendous task" of replacing his entire line from left tackle to right tackle. Conn wrote that Kipke's challenges were made worse by a "suicide schedule" and added:"No one can accuse the Wolverines of gaining a synthetic title if they can clamor triumphantly thru that list. In fact, it looks like Michigan athletic fathers had their eyes on the financial possibilities of such a schedule rather than a victorious season for their famed 'champions of the west.'" In mid-September 1932, the Associated Press published a feature story on the prospects of the 1932 Michigan team. The article focused on the "natural apprehension" of Coach Kipke in facing eight major opponents on eight consecutive Saturdays.

The Myth of Skanderbeg is one of the main constitutive myths of Albanian nationalism. Albanian nationalist writers transformed Skanderbeg's figure and deeds into a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions, and folklore. The Myth of Skanderbeg is the only myth of Albanian nationalism that is based on a person; the other myths are based on ideas, abstract concepts, and collectivism. There are two different Skanderbegs today: the historic Skanderbeg, and a mythic national hero as presented in Albanian schools and nationalist intellectuals in Tirana and Pristina.
