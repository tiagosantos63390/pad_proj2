After the defeat of the French Army in 1940 many regiments were disbanded, including the 8th Engineer Regiment (many of whose personnel entered the French Resistance). The number “8” reappears on 1 April 1946 at Fort Mont-Valérien with the formation of the 8th Signal Battalion. Exactly a year later, 1 April 1947, the battalion is transformed into the 8th Signal Regiment, inheriting the honors and traditions of the 24th Telegraph Sapper Battalion and 8th Engineer Regiment.
History.
Cusack is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:
In 1910, a revolution installed a Republican government that took over all State Orders except the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa; as a result, King Manuel II of Portugal in exile and, after his death, the Dukes of Braganza continued to use the order's insignia and to bestow it as they considered the Order to belong to their dynasty rather than the state. Just after the Second World War, it was bestowed on Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar by Queen Amelia when she visited Portugal for the last time.
