As the group's passage through the forest continues, they encounter an elf named Damara and her mistress Freyja, a mysterious necromancer. Freyja cryptically forewarns that not all of Alora's companions shall survive their trek, but one is destined to slay the dragon. Declaring that she shall render them aid, Freyja and Damara join the Princess as well. The necromancer easily takes measure of the group's character, noting the budding romance between Cador and Alora.
James "Jaimy" Emerson Fletcher: He is Jacky's true love and betrothed. Driven mad by her death, he becomes the famous Highway Man. The book heavily alludes to the poem "The Highwayman", including similar descriptions, characters, themes, and settings. He starts dating a girl named Bess (just as in "The Highwayman") and she helps him plan robberies and find information on Flashby and Biffil. The ending is closely related to the poem as well.
