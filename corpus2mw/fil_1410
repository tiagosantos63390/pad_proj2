After 7 years in the Premier Division the Club prepared for its first experience in the First Division. The committee decided that it was important to focus on the financial aspect and not on the team. This made the team weak and by the end of the season, the team only took 2 draws. One has to remember a fine 3-0 win against league winners Balzan Youths which was overturned by the protest board, where the board never found the Club guilty of anything. Although it was a very difficult season, three important things were achieved. First the club started to see the end of the dark tunnel when it comes to financial difficulties, and slowly but surely the club started to get on better financial footing. The second important thing was that due to the financial difficulties a lot of youngsters from the Club’s Nursery started joining the first squad and made their debuts during this season. It was a really good experience for these players for the seasons to come. The third and most important thing that the Club managed to achieve was to sell its old premises, and acquire a lease on a new premises which were going to be converted into the new Club House and Bar in the most central part of Msida, that is exactly side to the Church.
