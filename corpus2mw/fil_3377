Yorke's eclectic mind and contacts have allowed him to place artistic opposites together on the same stage. He conceptualised and organised the union of classically influenced British rockers Procol Harum with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, introducing the live gig and earning the band their first gold album in 1972. Yorke also discovered the ‘Song of Joy’ by Spanish singer, composer Miguel Ríos. Yorke introduced it to the English speaking world where it reached the top of the charts in 1970. Yorke later went to Spain after writing the lyrics for the New World Symphony, originally composed by Antonín Dvořák. Miguel Ríos sang the New World Symphony song whilst Yorke oversaw the recording of it by the Madrid Symphony Choir in Spain.

There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary "spicing", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort ("Hypericum perforatum") or of kava ("Piper methysticum") can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress. However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution.
