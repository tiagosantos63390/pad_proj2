If there are more than two contestants in the Singles Area after all couples have chosen, the single contestants (in the order of their arrival in the Singles Area) may attempt again to create a partnership with one of the other singles. If all the single contestants continue to decline any partnerships with each other, they will all be eliminated. This feature resulted in the double elimination of Season 1, Episode 6, when the four remaining Singles Area competitors were unable to form any couples.

Curiously, though it has been perceived as anti-war, Hamilton’s novel is actually an ardent and patriotic defense of the British war effort, with its most devastating critiques being against the home pacifist movement. Ridiculing English pacifists as being “self-centered,” Hamilton accuses them of walking “the pathways of the paradise of fools,” and of being unwilling and unable to recognize the necessity of war when it came. William Tully, the hapless protagonist of the story, goes through three distinct phases in his attitude toward war: 1.) naïve pacifism before the War; 2.) martial patriotism after the Germans kill his new bride; 3.) weary disillusion with his unappreciated role in the war effort. Though Tully does end up embittered against war in general, Hamilton never swerves from her dominant thesis that this disillusionment does not contradict the absolute rightness of the Allied war effort, a rightness justified by the implacable, inhuman menace of the German Empire. Just when the reader expects the story to turn against war in general, Hamilton assures us that Tully has not “drifted” back toward his “former” pacifism: “He hated the war as it affected himself, was weary of the war in general; all he longed for was its ending, which meant his release from imprisonment; but neither hatred nor weariness had blinded his eyes to the folly of that other blindness which had denied that war could be.”
