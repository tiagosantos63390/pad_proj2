Origin.
The 16H and the Model 18 were also the first civilian models built by Norton after ending of the hostilities. In 1947 the machine received its final modification with telescopic forks, improving handling and giving the bike a more modern look, despite its age. The basic engine configuration proved popular with customers so Norton continued production until the mid-1950s when the fashion for twin cylinder motorcycles was prevalent. The 16H has a strong following of enthusiasts to this day.

As with all Paralympic powerlifting events, lifters competed in the bench press. Each athlete was allowed three attempts to bench press as much weight as possible. Athletes attempting to break a record were allowed a fourth attempt. For the attempt to be valid, the competitor must have lowered the weighted bar to his chest, held it motionless for a moment, then pressed the bar upwards until his arms were fully extended. If the competitor failed to meet these requirements or any other rule infraction was committed, the attempt was declared invalid by a team of three referees and the result struck from the record.
