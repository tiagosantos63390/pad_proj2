On 21 August 1837 the Company received a concession from the Prussian government to build the railway line from Cologne via Düren and Aachen to the Belgian border, a distance of 86 kilometres. The first seven kilometres of track from Cologne to Müngersdorf was opened in 1839. Two further sections to Lövenich and from Düren to Aachen were completed in 1840 and 1841. This included the 1,632 m long Königsdorfer Tunnel, which has now been opened to create a cutting. The last section to the Belgian border at Herbesthal was opened to traffic on 15 October 1843. There was a grade of 1:38 between Aachen and Ronheide (the Ronheide ramp). Until 1855, cable-haulage powered by a stationary steam engine assisted trains up the slope. The line was the first line linking Germany with a non-German country.
Elements of pre-Han Dynasty mythologies such as those in Shan Hai Jing were adapted into these belief systems as they developed (in the case of Taoism), or were assimilated into Chinese culture (in the case of Buddhism).

For example, the Taoist belief of a spiritual paradise became incorporated into mythology, as the place where immortals and deities dwell.

Born in Taylorville, Illinois, he was known by his middle name, Eugene, or as "Gene." In the 1870s, thirteen-year-old Leigh became involved in Quarter Horse racing on bush tracks in his native Illinois. After learning to condition Thoroughbreds for flat racing he set himself up as a trainer in a partnership with jockey Tom Kiley. Leigh was successful enough that in 1884 he was hired as the trainer of a major racing stable in St. Louis, Missouri owned by Col. Robert C. Pate.
Soon after his death, a compilation of interviews with Jean Aurenche was published. Named "La Suite à l'écran" ("To be continued on the screen"), this book co-wrote by French journalist Alain Riou contained insights andinformations about most of Jean Aurenche's screenplays and collaborators. Later, almost ten years after his death, Bertrand Tavernier co-wrote and directed a film about the life of Jean Aurenche and Jean Devaivre (a French assistant director) during World War II. The film, named Laissez Passer was starring Jacques Gamblin (as Jean Devaivre) and Denis Podalydès (as Jean Aurenche).
