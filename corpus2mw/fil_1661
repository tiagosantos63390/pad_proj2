He wrote songs and poems in several newspapers and journals, of which several were put to music by Willem De Mol, such as "Lentelied", "Ik ken een lied", "Droeve tijden", and "Bethlehem". They were published in one volume in 1873. In 1874, he was awarded for a minnelied (E: romantic song) by the Antwerp Chamber of rhetoric, "De Olijftak" (E: Olive branch). In addition he wrote "Uit het hart"', "Liederen en gedichten" (Dendermonde and Leiden, 1875); "Liederkrans uit de Loverkens" van Hoffmann von Fallersleben, with his own music (Ghent, 1877); "Leven, lieven en zingen" (Ghent, 1879), "Naar wijd en zijd" (1905, put on music by François-Auguste Gevaert). A now relatively unknown song of him is "Mijn Vlaanderen heb ik hart'lijk lief", on lyrics by Theofiel Coopman. He was buried in Oudenaarde, where the "Gentiel Antheunisplein" is named after him.
