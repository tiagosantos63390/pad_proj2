Just months into his first term, a family in Lampson's district suffered a widely publicized tragedy. A 12-year-old girl from Friendswood was abducted on April 3, 1997 and found murdered two weeks later on April 20. Lampson established the first-ever Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, which now numbers more than 120 members from both parties. Bob Smither, the father of the murdered girl, would become Lampson's Libertarian opponent in the 2006 election. The Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus is credited with nationalizing the successful AMBER Alert system. Lampson sponsored legislation to fund law enforcement efforts to stop child pornography and exploitation on the Internet.

Toril was the name of Jeff Grubb's campaign world, and it was adopted as the name of the planet upon which the continent of Faer√ªn existed when he and Ed Greenwood were designing the original "Forgotten Realms Boxed Set" in 1987. Abeir- was added as a prefix to the planet's name so that it would be the first entry in the alphabetical encyclopedia of terms included in the set. The setting's entire planet underwent a major change during the 1989 "Avatar" trilogy, which detailed a series of events called the Time of Troubles, during which gods walked the earth and magic became unpredictable. These events caused permanent changes in gameplay that were outlined in the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" 2nd edition campaign setting books.
