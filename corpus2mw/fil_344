The controls for several actions has been modified from previous "Alpha" games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously.

While the films were used as a means of better capitalising on the bands success than long strings of small concert venues, both McGlashan and Sinclair began to move away from the band to writing songs and directing respectively. McGlashan in particular was keen to return to the live circuit, though he was also doing film composition such as An Angel At My Table.
The acronym is analogous to the ABC islands, which comprise Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, also part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. All six island territories were formerly part of the Netherlands Antilles.
So in order to increase the complexity of the machines, the modules would have to grow. In theory, this could slow the machine down due to signalling delays. Cray aimed to solve these contradictory problems by doing both; making each module larger and crammed with many more components, while at the same time making the computer as a whole smaller by packing the modules closer together inside the machine. In the case of the 8600, this led to modules containing eight four-layer circuit boards about 8" by 6", resulting in a stack the size of a large textbook and using up about 3 kilowatts of power.
Maximillion J. Pegasus, known in Japanese versions as , is the eccentric American Chairman of Industrial Illusions (shortened to I²) and the creator of the game Duel Monsters ( in the Japanese manga). He is the wielder of the . In the original manga, it's his story about meeting Shadi and the supposed "evil intelligence" of the Millennium Items that prompts Dark Yugi's search for the answer of who he is and where he came from. During his final Shadow Game with Yugi/Dark Yugi, he tells them of his discovery of an ancient Egyptian Shadow Game during his travels in the Valley of the Kings, which inspired his creation of Duel Monsters and the creation of card games in general, such as tarot cards. In the anime, as the creator of the card game Duel Monsters and the discoverer of their ancient Egyptian roots, Pegasus often plays a key role due to his extensive knowledge of the game and its mysterious origins. He has a habit of calling Yugi Mutou "Yugi-boy" and Seto Kaiba "Kaiba-boy" in the Japanese and edited English versions of the anime and manga. This trend continues in the "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX" anime, calling Jaden Yuki "Jaden-boy." Interestingly, in Japanese versions of the manga and anime, Pegasus often uses English words interspliced with Japanese, including English words like "goodness gracious!" and "snap!" and using the English pronoun "you" instead of Japanese second-person words. His speech is also unique in terms of pronunciation. In both English and Japanese he tends to elongate vowel sounds, especially near the end of a sentence.
The character of Sondra did not appear in The Cosby Show's original pilot. The family at that point consisted of four children, with Denise Huxtable, played by Lisa Bonet, as the eldest. The producers decided to add Sondra because Bill Cosby also had five children and also because they wanted to show an offspring in college as a result of a strong family upbringing. With the addition of Sondra, Theo became the middle child. The character's first appearance was in the Season 1 episode "Bonjour, Sondra." Sondra was known for her philosophical statements and intelligence, traits she displayed as an undergraduate at Princeton University.

The United Kingdom's navigable water network grew as the demand for industrial transport increased. The canals were key to the pace of the Industrial Revolution: roads at the time were unsuitable for large volumes of traffic. A system of very large pack horse trains had developed, but few roads were suitable for wheeled vehicles able to transport large amounts of materials (especially fragile manufactured goods such as pottery) quickly. Canal boats were very much quicker, could carry large volumes, and were much safer for fragile items. Following the success of the Bridgewater Canal, other canals were constructed between industrial centres, cities and ports, and were soon transporting raw materials (particularly coal and lumber) and manufactured goods. There were immediate benefits to households, as well as to commerce: in Manchester, the cost of coal fell by 75% when the Bridgewater Canal arrived.
ACORN was a political issue in the 2008 presidential election over allegations of voter registration fraud and conflict of interest. During the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary ACORN's national political action committee, ACORN Votes, endorsed Barack Obama. Obama, with several other attorneys, had served as local counsel for ACORN in a 1995 voting rights lawsuit joined by the Justice Department and the League of Women Voters. Obama's campaign hired an ACORN affiliate for $800,000 to conduct a get-out-the-vote effort during that primary, but did not retain ACORN for the general presidential election.
