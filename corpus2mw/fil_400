Prince Levon I, T'oros' brother and successor, started his reign in 1129. He integrated the Cilician coastal cities to the Armenian principality, thus consolidating Armenian commercial leadership in the region. During this period, there was continued hostility between Cilician Armenia and the Seljuk Turks, as well as occasional bickering between Armenians and the Principality of Antioch over forts located near southern Amanus. In this context, in 1137, the Byzantines under Emperor John II, who still considered Cilicia to be a Byzantine province, conquered most of the towns and cities located on the Cilician plains. They captured and imprisoned Levon in Constantinople with several other family members, including his sons Ruben and T'oros. Levon died in prison three years later. Ruben was blinded and killed while in prison, but Levon's second son and successor, T'oros II, escaped in 1141 and returned to Cilicia to lead the struggle with the Byzantines. Initially, he was successful in repelling Byzantine invasions; but, in 1158, he paid homage to Emperor Manuel I through a short-lived treaty. Around 1151, during T'oros' rule, the head of the Armenian Church transferred his see to Hromkla. Ruben II, Mleh, and Ruben III, succeeded T'oros in 1169, 1170, and 1175, respectively.

In addition to these improvements, another breakthrough in the Lancer lineup was the Silent Shaft Technology, which was actually two counterbalancing shafts that rotated in opposite directions, cancelling the power pulses inherent in an inline 4-cylinder engine. This reduced both engine noise and vibration, and provided a smoother driving experience. The 1.8-liter Sirius 80 engines were then introduced in the Lancer in 1980, along with a new , 1.2 L engine a year later, providing a broader range of engines for the Mitsubishi's Lancer. Also, a turbocharged, engine was added in 1980 for sportier performance, and an intercooler system was also integrated in the existing turbocharged engine to produce in 1983.

Blair was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He is the son of Myer Ogus and Deborah (Della) Greenbaum (mother's name given as Brenner on FreeBMD). His father was a barber; he emigrated from Russia to Canada to start a new life and his wife joined him shortly afterwards. The family was Jewish. Blair came to Britain when he was two years old. His first public performances were with his sister Joyce (1932–2006) in London Underground Station air raid shelters during the Second World War. He attended the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford in 1944, followed by London's University of East London, where he majored in ethnography. Blair eventually rekindled his passion for musical theatre and began working in the West End. He gave up acting for dancing in 1947 although he subsequently appeared in the fringe production "Out of the Blue" (Chichester) and "Who Killed Agatha Christie" (national tour) among other acting credits. He took his stage name around this time, later changing it by deed poll just before he married in 1967 (his sister also decided to use the same surname professionally).
