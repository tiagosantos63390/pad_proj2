Mantua is a town in eastern Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 687 at the 2010 census. Mantua was settled in the mid-19th century when future LDS President and then apostle and head church authority in Box Elder County Lorenzo Snow sent settlers to the valley to grow flax. The first group arrived in Mantua in 1863, and were all emigres from Denmark and their local leader was Hans Jens Jensen. Snow was from Mantua, Ohio, and the town was named after the Ohio community in his honor.
