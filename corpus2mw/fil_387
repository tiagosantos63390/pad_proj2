In July 2012, it was revealed in "NME" magazine that Wolstenholme wrote and sang two songs on the album The 2nd Law, 'Liquid State' and 'Save Me'. Both songs were written shortly after quitting alcohol. “‘"Liquid State"’ was written about the person you become when you’re intoxicated and how the two of them are having this fight inside of you and it tears you apart. ‘"Save Me"’ was about having the family, the wife and kids who, despite all the crap I’ve put them through, at the end of it you realise they’re still there and they’re the ones who pulled you through.” He also added that "'Save Me' is a sort of a love song and I think it's the more positive among the two, it's about having a difficult time and having a person in your life who can pull you through – my wife, in my case. I guess it's all about searching stability, finding it through the person you love."
