Johnsonville is considered a "railroad town" due to the importance of the railroad in the history of the area; however, it was an important industrial area even before the coming of railroad. Due to its close proximity to the Hoosic River, the largest estuary of the Hudson River, many factories sprung up along the river banks: flour, grist and lumber mills; axe factories; and other types of industry. The Johnsonville Axe Factory was once the largest axe factory in the world. The coming of the railroad in 1830 made it much easier for these factories to market and transport their products, and contributed to the industrial growth of the hamlet.
"Just One Last Dance" is a song by German recording artist Sarah Connor, taken from her third studio album, "Key to My Soul" (2003). The pop ballad was written and produced by Kay Denar and Rob Tyger. A reissue featuring guest vocals by Connor's husband Marc Terenzi's former band Natural was released by X-Cell Records on March 1, 2004 – one month after the birth of the couple's son Tyler – as the second and final single from the album. Lyrically, the song alludes to couple's final dance in a Spanish cafe before they are forced to part ways.
