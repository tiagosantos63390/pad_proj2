After their initial success in arming several villages in Kastoria, Kalchev went to the German occupied zone in order to start arming villages in Edessa region. In Edessa, with the help of the German occupation authorities, Kalchev created the Ohrana para-military unit. In 1943, Ohrana detachments counted a total of around 3,000 members and organized guerrilla activity. In the tradition of the IMRO Komitadjis, these bands pursued the local Greek population, including Greek-identifying Slavophones, Aromanians, and Pontic Greeks, seeing them as an obstacle to an all-Bulgarian Macedonia. The main leaders during the early phase of activity from 1941 to 1942 were Tsvetan Mladenov and Andon Kalchev in the Florina prefecture, where there were 600 men under arms. 
As the story progresses, the romantic relationship between Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min deepens, even though they are entangled in a love triangle with Zhou Zhiruo. When Zhang decides to marry Zhou, Zhao Min appears and disrupts the wedding, stating that her second condition (when she agreed to free the captured martial artists) is that Zhang cannot marry Zhou. Zhang rejects the request initially, but accepts later when Zhao Min tells him that she knows the whereabouts of his godfather Xie Xun. Zhou Zhiruo hates Zhao Min and she attacks Zhao with the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' but Zhang saves Zhao.

He was also High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1831, and Lord Lieutenant of Flintshire from 1845 to 1871. He sat in the Tory interest, and, although he remained on excellent terms with Gladstone throughout his life, he shared few of Gladstone's Liberal ideals. He was an extremely shy individual who found public speaking an ordeal, and he never spoke in Parliament.
