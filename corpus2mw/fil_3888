Since completion in October 2010 Adnams Brewery has produced a number of spirits including gin & vodka. In 2010 and 2011 Adnams distiller John McCarthy produced spirit to be aged as single malt whisky. Currently the distillery uses a mix of used American oak hogsheads and new French oak to age the single malt spirit. Below the distillery in the old brewery cellars casks are stored in the whisky cellar & brewery museum.
All data is based on 2013 and 2011 estimates.
