The Sivas Congress was the first time the fourteen leaders of the movement united under a single roof. These people formed a plan between 16 to 29 October. They agreed that the parliament should meet in Constantinople, even if it were obvious that this parliament could not function under the occupation. It was a great chance to build the base and legitimacy. They decided on formalizing a "Representative Committee" that would handle the distribution and implementation, which could easily be turned into a new government if allies decided to disband the whole Ottoman Governing structure. Mustafa Kemal established two concepts into this programme: independence and integrity. Mustafa Kemal was setting the stage for conditions which would legitimize this organization and illegitimate the Ottoman parliament. These conditions were also mentioned in the Wilsonian rules.
Al-Mayah's bodyguard, Mohamed Sahib, did not have a gun since he was still waiting for a gun licence from US authorities. Sahib stated, "They shouted for the car to stop...

Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised Alphonse's development in the manga, especially where he refuses to recover his weakened body and instead helps his friends. As a result, Silverman brought a comparison between the two brothers and wondered whether Edward would have done the same. Chris Beveridge found the character's growth in "Conqueror in Shamballa" appealing as he starts visually resembling Edward. After Aaron Dismuke's voice matured, Anime News Network writer Justin Sevakis criticized him for his part in the "Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection", writing that "he simply no longer sounds like Alphonse".

In February 2010 the Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy, said in the House of Commons that faith was "at the very foundations of the Labour Party" and encouraged openness to religion in public life. O'Brien responded by saying he "welcomed the sentiment" but pointed out that "a tangible example by the Government over the last decade that it acknowledged or endorsed religious values would also have been welcomed.

At first, Natalie found no proof of any poisonous substance, but she later called Bo to tell him that she checked the tests again, and found arsenic in the liquor holder, confirming Todd's suspicions that Victor Jr. poisoned him after all.

Rules of evidence represents just one example of the different practice that applies to international arbitration, and which distinguishes it from provincial forms of arbitration rooted in the procedures of a particular legal system. There are a variety of approaches to international arbitration at the national level, even where model laws have been adopted. These approaches can be further impacted by arbitral rules that may be agreed between the parties. Similarly, international arbitral practice has given rise to its own non-country-specific standards of ethical conduct which are believed to apply in international proceedings and, more to the point, to the arbitrators who are appointed to conduct them.
