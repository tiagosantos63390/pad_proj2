A reserved British astronomer is drawn out of his quiet life and into an affair of international espionage behind the Iron Curtain.
At the 2012 Australian Open, Azarenka defeated defending champion Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals in three sets to reach her first grand slam singles final where she rallied from 2–0 down in the first set to defeat former Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova in straight sets and thus win her first grand slam singles title. With this achievement, Azarenka became the first player representing Belarus to win a Grand Slam title in singles. She also became the World No. 1 for the first time in her career as a result of the victory and thus became the first Belarusian player to hold the top ranking in singles. Following this victory, Azarenka extended her winning streak since the start of the year to 26 consecutive matches by winning titles in Doha and Indian Wells before losing in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Sony Ericsson Open to Marion Bartoli.
Videos are recorded with MPEG-4 compression and stored in 3GPP2 (.3g2) format, but it will also play movies in the standard MP4 container format. All videos must not exceed 320×240 in size, and may be up to 30 frames per second. The default time limit is 20 seconds (keeping it under 500kB, small enough to be sent by MMS), but touching the lower-right icon changes this to one hour (free-space permitting). Pictures are up to 1600×1200 or 1200×1600 ("two megapixels", or exactly 1,920,000, also known as UXGA), with the "digital zoom" simply cropping the picture rather than interpolating it, and white balance and brightness still being determined from the entire field of view rather than only what is within the zoomed area. There is no zoom when viewing pictures or videos, and no way to edit them on the phone.
