"Digital Spy" said; "Blow my mind, DJ, blow my mind," The Saturdays member Vanessa demands in a hazy and heavily synthesised fashion on the intro of the new The Saturdays single. Opening with what feels as if we've caught her in the middle of a boozy night out, it not only makes a change from her usual ad-libbing duties, but marks a sizeable shift for a group whose image relied on being squeaky clean... until now, that is.

It appeared that by that time rebels had taken the last intervening town, Ajaylat, consolidating the route to the capital, where shortages of food, water, fuel, and medical supplies were creating difficulties, though later reports indicated that a loyalist "pocket" remained at Ajaylat, with supply lines bypassing the town. Loyalist forces continued to shell the area from the interior.
