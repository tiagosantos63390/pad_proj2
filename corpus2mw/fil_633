In the 13th century there was a frenzy of building: the nave aisles were vaulted, the clerestory was built, the Montacute Chapels replaced the Norman apse in the north transept and work began on the North Porch, notable for its unusually large size. One of the chapels became the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, although the current building mostly dates from the 18th century.

The XGS Micro Edition is a pre-built video game console based around the SX52 microcontroller, which is a high-speed PIC microcontroller running at 80 MHz for a total of 80 MIPS. The color television video signal is generated in software on the microcontroller. Sound is generated by a ROHM BU8763 chip. For input, the system has a single PS/2 connector for keyboard or mouse input, as well as two DB-9 for connecting Atari-compatible joysticks. Programming is done in assembly language or in a custom written XGS Basic, either on a PC and then transferred to the console or on the system itself. It has add-on packs for creating your own expansion card and electronic experimenting kit. The Micro Edition contains the XGameStation unit, "Designing Your Own Video Game Console" - a detailed book in PDF format teaching the basics of electronics, a power supply, A/V cables, a joystick, a COM cable, and a few extras such as a PDF version of one of Andre LaMothe's previous books "Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus".
Bahá'u'lláh's seminal Kitáb-i-Íqán (in English, The Book of Certitude) is probably the best original description of the Bahá'í view of progressive revelation. In it Bahá'u'lláh describes the relationships between several Abrahamic prophets and how each accepted the previous, but was rejected by the previous prophet's followers. He uses these examples to highlight the legitimacy of the Báb to the reader, since the book was written in answer to some questions from the Báb's uncle. The work, however, establishes the core teaching of the Bahá'í Faith and is seen as being of more general applicability.

Geographers on the whole have been particularly critical of Friedman's writings, views influenced by the large body of work within their field demonstrating the uneven nature of globalization, the strong influence place still has on peoples' lives, and the dependent relationships that have been established between the have and have-not regions in the current world-system. Geographer Harm de Blij has detailed these arguments for the general public in "Why Geography Matters: Three Challenges Facing America" (2005) and "The Power of Place: Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape" (2008).

For a town of 1,300 people, Taylor has a very large industrial base and calls itself "The Industrial Capital of the North". Industrial plants include the Westcoast Energy's McMahon plant for natural gas processing with sulfur recovery and cogeneration, two straddle plants which extract ethane and other impurities from liquid natural gas, Fiberco Pulp's chemi-thermomechanical pulp mill, Peace River Greenhouses' silviculture facility for reforestation projects, and several smaller sawmills. Being involved in primary resource industries, the town is vulnerable to global trade, as demonstrated by the town's Canfor planer mill closing in 2004 during U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute. In response to the decline of the forest industry, the town has expanded its tourism industry. After the Canfor mill closure, the district established a plan to develop Peace Island Park for tourist operations. The federal Ministry of Western Economic Diversification, contributed $310,952 to the project.

Later on, in the year 1864, the school became the 'Poona Civil Engineering College'. The number of courses were increased to include forestry and agricultural subjects, which led to its name being changed to Poona College of Science. The course was revised in 1886 and the minimum criteria required for admission was raised from Matriculation to the then Previous Examination. All non-engineering courses were stopped by 1911, transferring the Bachelor of Science degree to the Science Institute of Bombay and subsequently in the year 1911, the name was changed to the 'College of Engineering, Poona'.

Many nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous "Boy", "Toto/Totoy" (young boy), "Girlie", "Nene" (young girl), "Baby" and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called "Boy" or "Baby" even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as "Pepito" for "Pepe", "Juanito" for "Juan" (or the English form "Johnny" for "John"), and "Nenita" for "Nena". Thus, a person used to being called "Joselito" ("Little Joseph") as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called "José" or "Joseph".

Smithatris is a new genus of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). The first species of this genus, "Smithatris supraneanae", was discovered in 1998 by Kress and Larsen, two researchers from Denmark, in the limestone hills of Saraburi Province, Thailand. The genus was thought to be monospecific until a second species, "Smithatris myanmarensis", was discovered later in Myanmar.

Lloyd began his wrestling career shortly after graduation. He was trained by Georgia grappler Fred Avery in a makeshift ring set up in Avery's backyard, and then cut his teeth on the Georgia independent circuit for two years, during which he was given the ring name "Sugar Ray" Lloyd by Tommy Rich.
