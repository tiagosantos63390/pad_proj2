The next day, the two siblings begin their training. Zia teaches them the concept of casting hieroglyphs to use magic. Carter surprises Sadie and Zia by summoning a combat falcon avatar of the war god Horus. Their training is disrupted when a magician informs Zia that Iskander is dead and Desjardins is next in line to be guardian for the throne of Egypt. Recognizing that Desjardins would want to kill them (as hosts to Isis and Horus), Sadie creates a portal and she and Carter escape to Paris, but not before bringing sphinxes with them. Bast, who is fine, takes care of them and Carter and Sadie infiltrate Desjardins' house so they can take a Book Of Truth to fight Set. Fruit bats attack them when they find the book, and magicians follow them when they run. Carter, Sadie, and Bast run to the Louvre and transport to the U.S. ending up at the Washington Monument.

The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution by lower-order organocuprates depends in a profound way on the structure of the substrate, organocuprate, and reaction conditions. Early evidence suggested that a direct SN2 displacement was occurring; however more recent results suggest that invertive oxidative addition of copper(I) into the carbon-leaving group bond takes place, generating a copper(III) intermediate which then undergoes reductive elimination to generate the coupled product. Both of these mechanisms predict inversion at the electrophilic carbon, which is observed in a number of cases. On the other hand, experiments with radical traps and the observation of racemization during substitution suggest a radical mechanism.
