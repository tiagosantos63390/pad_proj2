Waveney District Council had previously indicated in April 2010 that the station should be relocated 40m to the west and 80m to the south in order to "to strike the optimum balance between commercial viability, technical feasibility and acceptability in the eyes of key stakeholders and landowners". Relocation would "release a significant parcel of land for redevelopment in Peto Square between Denmark Road and Commercial Road", although it was said that "existing historic station buildings should be retained and integrated into any new development." Network Rail has objected to this policy on the basis that this would reduce the patronage of the station as was the case with , and and would incur substantial financial cost. Although the policy did not appear in the final version of the area action plan for Lake Lothing and the Outer Harbour Area, the document did nevertheless raise concerns as it purported to reduce the number of platforms at the station to two plus a siding for excursion trains.
The opening sequence in the TARDIS follows on directly from "Kinda". Since "The Visitation" was filmed before "Kinda", the cast had to act out their characters' responses to the events of "Kinda" based solely on the script.

The plot and graphics are similar to those of "Yoshi's Story" for the N64.

A monogamous mating system is one in which individuals form long-lasting pairs and cooperate in raising offspring. These pairs may last for a lifetime, such as in pigeons, or it may occasionally change from one mating season to another, such as in emperor penguins. Zoologists and biologists now have solid evidence that monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with extra-pair partners. This includes previous examples, such as swans. Sometimes, these extra-pair sexual activities lead to offspring. Genetic tests frequently show that some of the offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with an extra-pair male partner. These discoveries have led biologists to adopt new ways of talking about monogamy:
