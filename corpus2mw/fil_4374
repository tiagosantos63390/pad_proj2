Harmony By Karate emerged from traditional Shorinjiryu Karatedo, a system involving both hard and soft movements, and known as the Shaolin Temple Style. Founded by karate master Kori Hisataka, this system was designed to move away from the physical and philosophical rigidity of its Okinawan predecessors, and to focus on fluidity and individuality. Advocating a motto of “Individuality in body, mind, and spirit,” Hisataka aimed to identify the strong connection of the physical and the metaphysical as the pinnacle of martial arts training; in many ways, he accomplished this goal and forged a new path for the practice of karatedo, whose emphasis was on empowering and freeing the karateka (student) to adapt standard movements and philosophies to his or her own body, mind, and spirit.
