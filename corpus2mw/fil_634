Synopsis.
His book "Witchcraft and Its Transformations, c. 1650–1750" was published as an Oxford Historical Monograph in 1997. This – "the most sophisticated and original of all recent histories of early modern demonology" according to Professor Stuart Clark ("Witchcraft and Magic in Europe" volume 4, p139, 2002) – has been an influential work in the study of the pre-Enlightenment. It "achiev that rarest of feats in the scholarly world: taking a well-worn subject and ensuring that it will never be looked at in quite the same way again" (Noel Malcolm, TLS). In 1991 he won the National Federation of Music Societies Award and from 1992 received support from the Young Concert Artists Trust.
