Intervention effectiveness is evaluated continuously from multiple perspectives with MST team members held accountable for achieving successful outcomes. MST does not label families as “resistant, not ready for change or unmotivated.” This approach avoids blaming the family and places the responsibility for positive treatment outcomes on the MST team.

In a June 2011 interview by Mark Taylor for the Get Ready to Rock! website, Parr was asked why there was no further releases after Parr's following 1996 album "Under Parr" for over a decade. Parr responded ""I was dead in the water long before "Under Parr". From the nineties onwards I was locked in the litigation. I was ducking and diving doing little deals here and there to try and stay afloat. All my income was frozen for almost twenty years so I had to really bob and weave. "Man with a Vision" was really a bunch of demos but as there were no deals on the table I was forced to release it through Blue Martin a small label in Switzerland - it was the only game in town - on the up side the owner of that company Martin Scheiss and AR Sue Beherendt became lifelong friends. Even though we had very little exposure due to the court case - they invested in "Under Parr". I told them not to unless they could afford to promote it properly. In the end they spent a ton of money making the record and had little left to promote it. I walked away from music for the next ten years. It broke my heart. I was making records that only my family and friends heard - some of my best work I think, that no body was going to hear. The guitar stayed untouched in the box for ten years and I never sang a note.""

The Football League play-offs for the 1998–99 season were held in May 1999, with the finals taking place at the old Wembley Stadium in London. The play-off semi-finals were played over two legs and contested by the teams who finished in 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th place in the Football League First Division and Football League Second Division and the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th placed teams in the Football League Third Division table. The winners of the semi-finals went through to the finals, with the winner of the matches gaining promotion for the following season.


To Johnson, the first question was whether the Kentucky acts were constitutional. If constitutional, which act should be applied? The suit was filed after the legislation of 1797 was enacted, but before the legislation of 1812 was enacted.

Ultimate zone rating (UZR) is a sabermetric statistic used to measure fielding. It compares the event that actually happened (hit/out/error) to data on similarly hit balls in the past to determine how much better or worse the fielder did than the "average" player. UZR divides a baseball field into multiple zones and assigns individual fielders responsibility for those zones.

The major "mtindo" (style) popularized by IOSS was "ndekule", a word that is both a reference to traditional Tanzanian war dances and to a species of snakes. The snake thus became the icon of the band.
