The Pandur is an APC developed and produced by the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeuge (SSF). It was developed during the 1980s as a private venture, based on the Pegaso BMR-600 design. In 2003, General Dynamics took over Steyr-Daimler-Puch and is now part of General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems (ELCS), which is also the parent company of MOWAG and Santa Bárbara Sistemas.

In 2005, members of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, and others, criticized the foundation structure (and that of other similar foundations) for arguably permitting givers to take tax deductions out of proportion to the actual amounts given for public charity, and for potentially allowing the donors to have effective control of the community foundation. Because the Tulsa Community Foundation (unlike some private foundations) is not restricted from making gifts to government agencies, it has also drawn occasional comment and criticism for its potential influence on local government.
Galway: The "Falco Blanco" (300 tons, 103 men, 16 guns) and the "Concepcion" of Biscay (225 men, 18 guns) and another unknown ship entered Galway Bay. The "Falco Blanco" was grounded at Barna, five km west of Galway city, and most of those on board made it to shore. The "Concepcion" was grounded at Carna 30 km further west, having been lured to shore by the bonfires of a party of wreckers from the O'Flaherty clan.

"Wishlist" was first performed live at the band's November 12, 1997 concert in Santa Cruz, California at The Catalyst. The band played this song when it appeared on the "Late Show with David Letterman" in May 1998 in support of "Yield". Live performances of "Wishlist" can be found on various official bootlegs. Performances of the song are also included on the DVDs "Single Video Theory", "Touring Band 2000", and "Live at the Garden". In concert, the song is often extended, softly played, with a thoughtful outro jam, and sometimes segueing into another song such as the Buzzcocks' "Why Can't I Touch It". This can be heard on "Live at the Garden" especially.
In 2010, Lloyd made her film debut in the English horror movie "Cut".

In common with a number of Poitevin lords, Hugh could not accept the loss of autonomy which he had previously enjoyed and, like in 1173 – 1179, 1188 and 1194 against the king of England, and in 1219 – 1224, the Poitevin nobility formed a confederacy against their over-powerful sovereign. The starting point for the conflict was at Christmas time in 1241, when Hugh X of Lusignan, no doubt at the instigation of his wife, Isabelle of Angoulême, mother of Henry III of England, insulted the Count of Poitiers in his own palace, by refusing allegiance.
