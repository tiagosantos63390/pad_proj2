Griffith Glacier () is a tributary glacier draining westward from the California Plateau and the Watson Escarpment in Antarctica to enter Scott Glacier between Mount McKercher and Mount Meeks. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960â€“63, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Lieutenant Commander Philip G. Griffith, an aircraft commander on photographic flights during Operation Deep Freeze 1966 and 1967.
Mount Don Pedro Christophersen () is a massive, largely ice-covered, gabled mountain, high, surmounting the divide between the heads of Axel Heiberg Glacier and Cooper Glacier, in the Queen Maud Mountains. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen, who named it for one of the expedition's chief supporters who lived in Buenos Aires.
