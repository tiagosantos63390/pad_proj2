The Vlaamsche Hoogeschool (Dutch; "Flemish Academy"), commonly known as Von Bissing University (), was a Dutch-speaking university in Ghent established in German-occupied Belgium in October 1916. The university, which was separate from the existing Ghent University, formed part of the German "Flamenpolitik" and was a response to the long-established grievance of the Flemish Movement which campaigned against Ghent University's curriculum which was only taught in French despite its location in a majority Dutch-speaking region. The college took its nickname from Moritz von Bissing, the German Governor-general of Belgium 1914-17, and one of the chief proponents of the "Flamenpolitik".
Farming rice was discontinued in 1968 when a portion of the farm land was sold to develop Caroline subdivision in New Iberia and other housing developments were established near the irrigation system. Milling, however, continued and does so until this day. During its management by the Conrad family, the mill produced only white rice which was sold to local grocery stores.
