OLI collects data from nine spectral bands. Seven of the nine bands are consistent with the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors found on earlier Landsat satellites, providing for compatibility with the historical Landsat data, while also improving measurement capabilities. Two new spectral bands, a deep blue coastal / aerosol band and a shortwave-infrared cirrus band, will be collected, allowing scientists to measure water quality and improve detection of high, thin clouds.
After two years at Atlético Madrid, playing second-fiddle to another Spanish international, José Francisco Molina, Jaro retired at 36, with 237 games played in the top flight. He went on to serve as goalkeeping coach for Atlético, the national team and Real Madrid, moving to the latter in 1995 and remaining there for over a decade.
