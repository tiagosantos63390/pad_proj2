Critics of the modern-day airplane interpretation argue that the pre-Columbian culture in South America did not have the knowledge nor the technology to manufacture airplanes, and that the metal artifacts these cultures created were generally ornamental in nature or were small practical objects like knives. When these artifacts are compared to other similar artifacts of the time, most of them have been identified as fish or insects. The few that have not been positively identified with a specific animal does not constitute a big enough sample of the artifacts population to draw or extrapolate any significant statistical conclusions.
Around the sixteenth century, the Palace on the Way (or, "on the Road") was one of the most prominent noble residences in the area of Kleparz within the jurisdiction of Szlak. Originally completed in 1613 for the Montelupi merchant family of the Italian background, the Palace was purchased by the Jesuit Order in 1639; than by the Badeni family in 1773; and the Tarnowskis, in the 19th century. It was refurbished and expanded in 1878 during the foreign partitions of Poland by renown local architect Antoni Łuszczkiewicz.

Some people collected looted materials as their right of conquest. Reichmarschall Hermann Gőring was one of those. He amassed a large collection of artworks from the occupied countries. He also had a large personal library in Carinhall, his residence outside of Berlin. He also showed questionable taste in decorations. “The house contained a domed library with a 26 foot long desk of mahogany with bronze inlaid swastikas. The library also contained a pornographic table supported by four large replicated penises, each inserted through a pair of female breasts.”
