For many years after the settlement of the township, religious exercises were conducted by the traveling ministers of various denominations, usually at private houses or in the schoolhouses of the township. There is one Methodist Episcopal church which was built in 1870, and the class there contains a large membership. There is also one United Brethren church which has a fair list of members. It was built in 1874. Amboy township, aside from these two church organizations in the village of Metamora, has one Catholic church, called St. Mary’s, built in 1864, upon section twenty-six, and connected therewith is a cemetery especially dedicated for Catholic burials. The Methodist Episcopal church, upon the town line between Amboy and Royalton, was built in 1867. It has a small number of worshipers, and has sustained itself under adverse circumstances. The Reformed Church of Zion was built by the German residents about 1870. This society and the church edifice is due to the labors of Peter Kohl, who for years was their resident minister. The church building was located on section nine.

Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kyiv bought Mykhalyk in the 2005–06 season, originally signing a five-year contract. He was almost immediately loaned off to Zakarpattia Uzhhorod. Mykhalyk has stated in an interview that he was really surprised to get a call from Dynamo Kyiv president Ihor Surkis inviting him to come and try out for the team, as he never even had any attention from scouts of his local Volyn Lutsk of the Ukrainian First League. Even more shocking was a call-up to the main Ukraine national football team by coach Oleh Blokhin not long afterward.
