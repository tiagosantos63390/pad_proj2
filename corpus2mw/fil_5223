The Marion Nichols Summer House is a historic house at 56 Love Lane in Hollis, New Hampshire. The two-story wood frame house was built in 1935 to a design by Densmore, Mclear & Robbins. It was built for Marion Poole Nichols, a wealthy widow. The L-shaped main house is stylistically eclectic, including Tudor Revival features (including diamond-paned windows), Craftsman elements, and Colonial Revival elements. The property also includes a c. 1940 single-story structure which originally house a workshop and a billiard room, and a small brick wellhouse built about the same time as the house.

The Man Who Died in His Boat
On 8 September 1884, the "Altona-Kaltenkirchner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft" (Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company), which was established in the previous year, opened the line from Altona to Kaltenkirchen for passenger traffic. Freight operations commenced on 24 November 1884. The line was initially operated by the Kintzel & Lauser company, which had also built the line and owned share in the Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company. There was initially no provision for the transfer of freight to the state railways, but it was possible for freight to connect with the Hamburg tramway in Altona. Accordingly, a central buffer coupling was selected, which was also necessary at the beginning because of the sharp curves of the line. The AKE took over the management of the line in 1892.
The team announced a sponsorship deal with Ginga Scout on May 3, 2014.
