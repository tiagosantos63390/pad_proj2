Lancelot is constantly tied to the Christianity associated with Arthurian Legend. Raabe compares Lancelot’s quest for Guinevere in “Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart,” as a quest likening to Everyman’s quest for salvation and Christ’s quest for the human soul. This becomes intensified when he becomes the prophesied saviour of the captives of Logres. His adventure among the tombs is described in terms that suggest Christ’s “harrowing of Hell” and resurrection: he effortlessly lifts the lid off the sarcophagus, which bears an inscription foretelling his freeing of the captives.
Interestingly, during Cotton's first appearance in the series premiere, he is shown to in fact have knees. This is depicted in Hank's memory flashback of his father telling him about how his shins were blown off. Cotton is shown walking with distinct knee bends visible through his pants, albeit very close to his feet. This was presumably before the decision was made that Cotton's feet were re-attached directly to his knees. The discrepancy can be explained away as an inaccurate memory on the part of Hank.
