The McLean House has meaningful value because of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865. It also preserves the distinctive characteristics as embodying the period and method of construction typical in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-nineteenth century as well as being typical of a county government seat of that time period. It also represents a typical farming community in Virginia of the mid-nineteenth century.
Edwards was born in Caernarfon, Gwynedd in north Wales. His father, Owen Edwards, a Presbyterian minister, emigrated to Australia for health reasons, but his wife Mary died before she could join him with the children. Edwards was then brought up by his maternal grandparents in Dolgellau, and was educated at the county school there before studying at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He graduated with a BA degree in 1903, and later studied at Jesus College, Oxford (graduating from there in 1908). He had begun preaching at an early age and was ordained in 1909, serving firstly at Zion chapel in Carmarthen. Between 1911 and 1917, he was minister at a chapel in Oswestry; he also worked in chapels in Chester (1917 to 1923) and Bangor (1923 to 1928). Edwards was then appointed professor at Bala College in 1929, before becoming Principal of the Aberystwyth Theological College in 1939. After retiring in 1949, he moved back to Oswestry. In 1957, he was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Wales. He died on 5 October 1963 and was buried in Llanycil, Gwynedd.
