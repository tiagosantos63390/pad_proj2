Experimentally this is associated with an anomalous behaviour of the dielectric susceptibility, for example in SrTiO3. In a normal ferroelectric, close to the onset of the phase transition the dielectric susceptibility diverges as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature. However, in the case of a quantum paraelectric the dielectric susceptibility diverges until it reaches a temperature low enough for quantum effects to cancel out the ferroelectricity (Fig. 1b). In the case of SrTiO3 this is around 4K.
"Belenggu" uses ellipses and internal monologues heavily to represent the main characters' turmoil; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw calls it a "three-pronged interior monologue", noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue. Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka, "Belenggu" does not provide full exposition; instead, it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret, thus inviting more active participation. Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time, almost as if the novel were a film; he writes that, as a result, at times the transition between characters is unclear.
The 2005 Southern Conference Baseball Tournament was held at Joseph P. Riley, Jr. Park in Charleston, SC from May 23 through May 27. Eighth seeded won the tournament and earned the Southern Conference's automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament. It was the Paladins' second SoCon tournament win.
