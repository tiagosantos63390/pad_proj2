Gene Venzke had a long career, placing in the top five at the national outdoor championships ten times between 1930 and 1940. His greatest successes, however, came indoors, as he was national champion in 1932, 1933 and 1936 and also set a number of world records.
The cluster-expansion approach is a technique in quantum mechanics that systematically truncates the BBGKY hierarchy problem that arises when quantum dynamics of interacting systems is solved. This method is well suited for producing a closed set of numerically computable equations that can be applied to analyze a great variety of many-body and/or quantum-optical problems. For example, it is widely applied in semiconductor quantum optics and it can be applied to generalize the semiconductor Bloch equations and semiconductor luminescence equations.

The "Blitz" class avisos were the first step toward creating the modern, steel-hulled light cruiser, which would ultimately come to fruition in the , built a decade later. The "Blitz"-class ships were also the first steel-hulled ships of any type built by the German Navy. At the time of their completion, they were among the earliest torpedo cruisers in the world.
