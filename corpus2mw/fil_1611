Donald, Gyro, and the boys travel to the United Kingdom to test the time machine at Stonehenge. The machine sends them centuries to the past, to time of sub-Roman Britain. There, the ducks meet "King Arthur"â€”Artorius Riothamus, the last descendant of Lucius Artorius Castus, and find out that he is nowhere near the glorious benevolent ruler history has made him to be; instead, he's a common warlord without much morals to speak of. Fearing the ducks are Saxon invaders, Arthur kidnaps Donald and his nephews, and is about to execute them, but at the last moment, Gyro sounds a car horn, which scares the Britons off.
