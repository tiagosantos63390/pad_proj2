The Broad Ripple Park Carousel was purchased by The Children's Museum of Indianapolis in 1950 and was moved there. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, the carousel is still in operation.
Throughout his career Mukai was known for working in both action and sex genres, and in the 1970s, Mukai made several films in both genres, and with the two genres mixed for the Toei Company. "Deep Throat in Tokyo", directed for Toei in 1975, is his best-known film. Comparing Mukai's film to the original "Deep Throat" (U.S., 1972), Jasper Sharp writes that Mukai's film, a softcore, "airbrushed fantasy" with a higher budget and, in Kumi Taguchi, a more attractive leading lady, is "a world apart from the more crude and direct approach taken by its revolutionary American model." Nevertheless, Sharp judges that Mukai's softcore film is more offensive than the hardcore original because of its more reactionary approach to sex.
