Nardini became very concerned about the conditions in which the poor children and older adults in the Pirmasens area were forced to live. He came to see that the Catholic population were an oppressed minority in the region, with work hard to obtain from the Protestant majority. Their children were even reduced to begging on the street. He began to organize charities to help his flock in their poverty. Nardini determined that a community of professed Sisters would be needed to guarantee the continuity of the services he had organized in the parish. The town council, composed entirely of Protestants, strongly opposed the establishment of a convent in the town. Nardini stood fast in his determination, despite threats to his life.

As producer and director of "Four Corners" during the first 3 years of the program's life, Raymond brought events occurring all over the world into the homes of Australia's first generation of television viewers. In 1963, he set up the Special Projects Division for the Nine Network, establishing the first documentary unit in Australian commercial television. Between 1963 and 1968 he wrote, produced and presented over 70 one-hour documentaries, shot at home and abroad, including "We, the Destroyers", with Alan Moorehead, which established the conservation genre in Australian television. "Life and Death on the Great Barrier Reef" (1969), "Shell's Australia" (1971–1975), "Discover Australia's National Parks" (1978), "Pelican's Progress" (1979), "Out of the Fiery Furnace" (1984) and "Man on the Rim" (1988) opened the eyes of all Australians to the world around them. His non-fiction books – from "Australia's Wildlife Heritage" (1975) and "Australia: The Greatest Island" (1979) to "Fifty-Two Views of Rudy Komon" (1999) and his three volumes of autobiography, offer unique insights into the natural and cultural world of 20th century Australia.
"Enchanter" received some attention before the official release in North America, the author was invited to an Anime Expo in North America before the official release date, and found out that a lot of fans obtained copies of the Japanese version to read and for her to sign. She is surprised that in contrary to its popularity among males in Japan, the North American fan community consists of a larger portion of females. The favourite character is different from in Japan as well; Paracelsus (a.k.a. the skeleton man in "Enchanter", modeled after the real world alchemist, Paracelsus) is the most popular character in North America, but in Japan, the most popular character is Haruhiko. She is also a little confused that the humour in the plot is seen differently by Americans.

The team knows nothing about Bruce's fate. At spring training, Dutch is preparing to release Bruce in favor of a hot young prospect, country boy Piney Woods. So management is amazed and confused when Henry ends his holdout and agrees to a new contract on one condition: that he and Bruce come as a package. If one is on the team, so is the other.
