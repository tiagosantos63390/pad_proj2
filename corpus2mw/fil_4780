Sandilh Point (, ‘Nos Sandilh’ \'nos san-'dilh\) is the partly ice-free point on the northwest side of the entrance to Durostorum Bay on Oscar II Coast in Graham Land. It is situated at the east extremity of Tepava Ridge, and was formed as a result of the break-up of Larsen Ice Shelf in the area, and the retreat of Pequod Glacier in the early 21st century. Named after the Bulgar ruler Sandilh (6th century).
