In 1844 all three railways amalgamated to become the Midland Railway, and Derby station became the new company's headquarters. The story goes that Joseph Paxton, a director of the railway, produced his first sketch for the Crystal Palace during a board meeting there. The North Midland had built a repair shop, with the other two building locosheds. These were amalgamated to form the Midland's main locomotive works. Among a number of innovations was the trial of steel rail developed by Robert Forester Mushet in 1857.
If 's' is the deleterious selection coefficient (the decrease in relative fitness), then the equilibrium frequency 'f' of an allele in mutation–selection balance is approximately formula_3 in haploids, or for the case of a dominant allele in diploids. For a recessive allele in 
There was anticipation that DNA testing might indicate whether there was Middle-Eastern ancestry among the Bnei Menashe. In 2003 the author Hillel Halkin, who had written about the Bnei Menashe in his "Across the Sabbath River" (2002), helped arrange genetic testing of Mizo-Kuki peoples. A total of 350 genetic samples were tested at Haifa's Technion – Israel Institute of Technology under the auspices of Prof. Karl Skorecki. According to the late Mizo research scholar Isaac Hmar Intoate, who was involved with the project, researchers found no genetic evidence of a Middle-Eastern origin for the Mizo-Chin-Kuki.
