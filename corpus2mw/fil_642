Contractions, where the final letter is present, are often written in British English without full stops/periods ("Mr", "Mrs", "Dr", "St", "Ave"). Abbreviations where the final letter is not present generally do take full stops/periods (such as "vol.", "etc.", "i.e.", "ed."); British English shares this convention with the French: "Mlle", "Mme", "Dr", "Ste", but "M." for "Monsieur". In American and Canadian English, abbreviations like "St.", "Ave.", "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Ms.", "Dr.", and "Jr.", always require periods. Some initials are usually upper case in the U.S. but lower case in the UK: liter/litre and its compounds ("2 L or 25 mL" vs "2 l or 25 ml"); and ante meridiem and post meridiem ("10 P.M." or "10 PM" vs "10 p.m." or "10 pm"). Both AM/PM and a.m./p.m. are acceptable in American English, though AM/PM is more common.
