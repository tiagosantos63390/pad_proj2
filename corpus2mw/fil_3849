The Side Show of Life (1924) is a silent film produced by Famous Players-Lasky, directed by Herbert Brenon and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film is based on the novel " The Mountebank" by William J. Locke which had been turned into a play by Ernest Denny. 
For their qualifying song, and their first as a group, at judges houses, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "Torn". In week 1 of the live shows, they performed "Viva la Vida" and were safe for the week. Week 2 was "Musical Heroes", and One Direction sang "My Life Would Suck Without You", which received positive comments from the judges; Minogue called them "five heartthrobs" and praised their performance, Cole called them "cute" and Cowell said "You are the most exciting pop band in the country right now." They sang "Nobody Knows" in week 3, "Total Eclipse of the Heart" in week 4. In week 4, girl band Belle Amie were eliminated, leaving One Direction as Cowell's last remaining act. They sang "Kids in America" in week 5, "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" in week 6 and "All You Need Is Love" in week 7. They were safe each week, never once being in the bottom two. For weeks 8 and 9, they performed two songs: "Summer of 69" and "You Are So Beautiful" in week 8 and "Only Girl (in the World)" and "Chasing Cars "in week 9. They were safe both times, making it to the final live show, being the first ever manufactured group to do so. In week 10, they performed "Your Song". After performing "Torn" in the final, One Direction finished in third place behind runner-up Rebecca Ferguson and winner Matt Cardle.
