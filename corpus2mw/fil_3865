The movie was met with critical acclaim. Even though "Cocktail" could not manage a bumper initial, the movie picked up after a couple of days of the release. "Cocktail" has the dubious distinction of raising a controversy about the box-office performance. In a box-office analysis, Sify said that the film did not do well in the box office. However, an article in Expressbuzz.com, published some days after its release, said that the film is a "sleeper hit" and had a "dream run at the box office". According to Malayalamcinemanews.com, the official website of Kerala Film Producers Association, the film's distributor's share is between 4 million and 10 million, which makes the film only an average grosser.
