All of the exhaust from the P&W R-4360 was ducted straight out of the back of the nacelles. This provided additional thrust. Research showed that roughly 250 equivalent horsepower was generated by each engine exhaust during high speed cruise at 40,000 ft.

It was founded in 1894 thanks to a bequest from Henry James Campbell, who had made his fortune in the linen trade. Initially the school was primarily a boarding school but it has, particularly since the 1970s, become primarily a day school and in 2009 had 879 pupils, only about 85 (10%) of whom were boarders. As a selective independent school it admits pupils based on academic selection. Until 2006 pupils began at the school at age 11, but since the closure of the school's separate preparatory school, Cabin Hill, the school has accepted pupils from 4 into the newly built Junior School and both boys and girls into the school's kindergarten located on the school's grounds. The Latin motto of the school is "Ne Obliviscaris" (Do not forget).

"Hi International" was an instrument of public diplomacy—the attempt to promote national interests by informing, engaging, and influencing people around the world. The State Department produced "Hi" with the explicit goal of informing the youth of the Middle East and Muslim world about American culture. The project was based on the supposition that if this demographic had a clearer understanding of what America is really like, then some of their hostility could be assuaged. Consequently, the publication attempted to characterize America as a beautiful, multicultural sanctuary for technology and innovation. Political issues were largely ignored.
In 1378 Thomas Hatfield Bishop of Durham granted John de Neville a licence to fortify his property at Raby. John died in 1388 and was succeeded by his son, Ralph. Almost nothing of the family's papers survive from this period so there is little documentary evidence of Raby Castle's construction. The dating is based mostly on architectural details. In the words of historian Anthony Emery, the work "converted it from a defendable house into a palace-fortress".

The U.S. House election, 1926 was an election for the United States House of Representatives in 1926 which occurred in the middle of President Calvin Coolidge's second term. Coolidge's Republican Party lost seats to the opposition Democratic Party, but it retained a majority. The most pressing national matters at the time were fragmented, generally related to government's relationship to business or to providing social aid. However, no predominant issue was able to cast a shadow over the election. The small, populist Farmer-Labor Party also held two seats following the election.
The importance and benefit of establishing allodial title extends beyond the non-payment of property taxes. It also has significance in the area of homestead law. Pursuant to NRS 115.010, the available homestead exemption in Nevada is $550,000. However, if allodial title has been established and not relinquished, the homestead exemption "extends to all equity in the dwelling, its appurtenances and the land on which it is located."

Often called pandanus palms, these plants are not closely related to palm trees. The species vary in size from small shrubs less than tall, to medium-sized trees tall, typically with a broad canopy, heavy fruit, and moderate growth rate. The trunk is stout, wide-branching, and ringed with many leaf scars. They commonly have many thick prop roots near the base, which provide support as the tree grows top-heavy with leaves, fruit, and branches. These roots are adventitious and often branched. The top of the plant has one or more crowns of strap-shaped leaves that may be spiny, varying between species from to or longer, and from up to broad.

History.

The open firing range's story began when the New York City Parks Department acquired the property for Pelham Bay Park. In 1903 the Parks Department opened Rodman’s Neck to the public with public bathhouses, showers, picnic tables, and cooking facilities. During World War I (1914–1918) the United States Navy used the site as a training facility. In the 1920s Rodman’s Neck was once again used for park purposes. 
After being closed for many years the roof terrace and bridge to The Hayward have recently been reopened, with the creation of a new external gallery and a roof garden and cafe in partnership with the Eden Project in Cornwall. This reopens one of the most interesting pedestrian circulation possibilities of the original design. The roof terrace is reached by the external concrete staircase at the west corner on Queen's Walk near Festival Pier, which also leads to the lower level and the route to Festival Square. A crude disabled ramp, constructed of breeze blocks and bricks, has been added to the walkway between the QEH entrance and The Hayward.

The Soviet Union had been working on parallel projects, The Myasishchev "Buran" and Lavochkin "Burya" and a little later, the Tupolev Tu-123. The first two types were also large rocket-boosted ramjets while the third was a turbojet-powered machine. With the cancellation of the Navaho and the promise of ICBMs in the strategic missile role, the first two were canceled as well, though the Lavochkin project, which had some successful test flights, was carried on for R&D purposes and the Tupolev was reworked as a big, fast reconnaissance drone.

He was not responsible for creating the entire universe, and is somewhat disparaging of it, describing the Big Bang as "showy". After creating the Discworld, he left behind his personal grimoire, the "Octavo". This was, apparently, typical absent-mindedness; he says he once created a world and completely forgot the fingles. No-one noticed, because they evolved there and didn't know there "should" be fingles, but they could tell there was something missing somewhere, and it caused them deep psychological problems.
