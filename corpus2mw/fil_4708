The Argentine–Chilean naval arms race was extremely expensive for both countries. The Argentine government was able to purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421 million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced to take out a £2 million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.
He was born in County Tipperary, the eldest son of Godfrey Boate senior. His father was a clerk in the Court of Chancery (Ireland) , but this may have been a sinecure since the Boate family were substantial landowners in Tipperary. These lands had been granted to Katherine, widow of Gerard Boate (1604-1650), author of "The Natural History of Ireland"; Gerard and Katherine were probably Geoffrey's grandparents. The Boate family, originally called de Boot, came to Ireland from the Netherlands in the 1640s.

Crete, also known as East Prairie or Possum Walk, is a farm town 11 miles from Groveton in Trinity County, Texas. The town was established in 1870 by people from De Ridder, Louisiana. A school was formed in 1884. In 1902 the town was changed to Crete when a post office was established, named after a part of the Mediterranean Sea. The name was still used through the 1980s although for no known reason, some people referred it to Possum Walk. By 1990, Crete/East Prairie/Possum Walk was abandoned.
