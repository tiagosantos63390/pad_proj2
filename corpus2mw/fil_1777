On July 11, 2005, a six-alarm fire destroyed the Wasatch Junior High building. At 12:30 pm the fire alarm went off and the principal, Doug Bingham, discovered that the source of the fire was an old computer server in the media center. More than 100 firefighters fought the fire with six to eight fire trucks. The fire quickly spread to the attic, making what was a three-alarm fire, a six-alarm. The fire what so powerful and forceful that firefighters had to fight it from the outside. Doug Bingham said, "It's just a building, but a building is a place where people are invested in each other's lives, and this one is toast." The Granite District has accepted a 15.9 million dollar settlement to rebuild Wasatch. The proposed time for the full reconstruction of the building was fall of 2008.
