The influence of Vedic religion was marked in the religious life of the people in the south. The followers of Veda often entered into dispute with rival religions like Buddhism and Jainism. Hinduism was prevalent during the 1st century CE followed by Buddhism in the next three centuries and finally Jainism taking prominence during the 5th-6th centuries CE.
