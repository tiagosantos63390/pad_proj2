Bruce Springsteen famously played one song, the previously unreleased "Red Headed Woman", solo on acoustic guitar, then he and his hired band (this was during the time the E Street Band was dissolved) used amplified instruments the rest of the show; hence, the concert was called "MTV Plugged" (sometimes written "XXPlugged" after the album cover art). Reportedly Springsteen had been unhappy with the touring band's rehearsals of acoustic arrangements, and this is what led him to break the "Unplugged" format.
