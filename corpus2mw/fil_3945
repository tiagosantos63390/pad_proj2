"Drive" has been called a tough, hard-edged neo-noir art house feature, extremely violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, "Drive" turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene because that is when The driver kills the villains. "Drive" also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as "The Day of the Locust" (1975) and "To Live and Die in L.A." (1985). Other influences can be seen in the neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks – "a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone." "Drive"s title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by 1983's "Risky Business" editing table. Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partially inspired by the films of John Hughes.
