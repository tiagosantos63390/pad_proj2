PMA can cause Contact Urticaria Syndrome (CUS). Contact urticaria refers to a wheal-and-flare response occurring on the application of chemicals to intact skin. A wheal-and-flare response is a skin eruption that may follow injury or injection of an antigen. It is characterized by swelling and redness caused by a release of histamine. The reaction usually occurs in three stages, beginning with the appearance of an erythematous area at the site of injury, followed by development of a flare surrounding the site; finally a wheal forms at the site as fluid leaks under the skin from surrounding capillaries. CUS has been categorized as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with IgE (a type of anti-body) playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Investigations dealing with CUS seem to suggest that a percentage of urticarias encompass a contact mechanism.
