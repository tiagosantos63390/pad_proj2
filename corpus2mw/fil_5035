As Arsenal qualified for the Champions League by their league position, Hull City entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League at the third qualifying round; however, due to a change in UEFA rules, this was the last season the runners-up would enter the Europa League if the winners had already qualified for European competition.

Dzhebariki-Khaya () is an urban locality (a settlement) and the administrative centre and only official inhabited locality of Dzhebariki-Khaya Urban Okrug of Tomponsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia. It is located from Khandyga, the administrative center of the district. Its population as of the 2010 Census was 1,694, down from 2,125 recorded in the 2002 Census.
Once the division was restructured and renamed, it served with the Desert Mounted Corps for the rest of the war, taking part in the Second Transjordan Raid (30 April to 4 May 1918) and the Final Offensive, in particular the Battle of Megiddo (19 to 25 September) and the Capture of Damascus (1 October).
It sold 300 units by 2013, claimed to be the best-selling 10 m boat in 2010 and 2011, and was followed by larger models, GL 40 in 2011 and Greenline Ocean Class 70 in 2012.
Yan'an had served as the capital of Red China from the end of the Long March in 1935, through World War II, until its capture in 1947. The earlier KMT campaigns in the 1930s had been a failure.

Although there are multiple ways of producing free hydrogen, those methods require converting combustible molecules into hydrogen or consuming electric energy. Unless that electricity is produced from a renewable source—and is not required for other purposes— hydrogen does not solve any energy crisis. In many situations the disadvantage of hydrogen, relative to carbon fuels, is its storage. Liquid hydrogen has extremely low density (14 times lower than water) and requires extensive insulation—whilst gaseous hydrogen requires heavy tankage. Even when liquefied, hydrogen has a higher specific energy but the volumetric energetic storage is still roughly five times lower than gasoline. However, the energy density of hydrogen is considerably higher than that of electric batteries, making it a serious contender as an energy carrier to replace fossil fuels. The 'Hydrogen on Demand' process (see direct borohydride fuel cell) creates hydrogen as needed, but has other issues, such as the high price of the sodium borohydride that is the raw material.
