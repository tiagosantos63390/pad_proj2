Robert C. Hendrickson
Wipo of Burgundy (also Wippo; c. 995 – c. 1048) was a priest and writer. He was a chaplain to the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, whose biography he wrote in chronicle form, "Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris". Present at the election of Conrad II, he most likely followed the emperor on his campaigns into Burgundy (1033) and against the Slavs (1035), both of which he wrote with extensive clarity.

Born on December 12, 1920 in Brooklyn and raised in Manhattan, New York City, Kida attended the city's American School of Design, where Bill Fraccio and Bob Fujitani were classmates. Like many young artists in the 1930s to 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books, he then broke into the field at the Jerry Iger Studio, formerly Eisner & Iger, one of the earliest "packagers" that produced outsourced comic book content for publishers entering the new medium. Starting as an inker and background artist in 1941, Kida moved on to a staff position at Iger client Quality Comics. There he both penciled and inked his first known credited work, the feature "Phantom Clipper" in "Military Comics" #9 (April 1942).
