Spiders, unlike insects, have only two tagmata instead of three: a fused head and thorax (called a cephalothorax or prosoma) and an abdomen (also called the opisthosoma). The exception to this rule are the assassin spiders, whose cephalothorax is divided into two parts by an elongated "neck". Except for a few species of very primitive spiders (family Liphistiidae, also called "segmented spiders"), the abdomen is not externally segmented. The abdomen and cephalothorax are connected with a thin waist called the pedicle or the "pregenital somite", a trait that allows the spider to move the abdomen in all directions. This waist is actually the last segment (somite) of the cephalothorax and is lost in most other members of the Arachnida (in scorpions it is only detectable in the embryos). Unlike insects, spiders have an endoskeleton in addition to their exoskeleton.

Kinder Downfall is the tallest waterfall in the Peak District, with a fall. The waterfall was formerly known as "Kinder Scut", and it is from this that the plateau derives its name. Although usually little more than a trickle in summer, in spate conditions it is impressive. In certain wind conditions (notably when there is a strong west wind), the water is blown back on itself, and the resulting cloud of spray can be seen from several miles away. The Pennine Way crosses the River Kinder above Kinder Downfall.

They would be implicit heuristic processing, implicit rule-based processing, explicit heuristic processing, and explicit rule-based processing.

The trick is that before carrying the "1", it marks that digit as "taken" by replacing it with an "0". When it returns, it fills that "0" back in with a "1", "then moves on to the next one", marking it with an "0" and repeating the cycle, carrying that "1" across and so on. "With each trip across and back, the marker "0" moves one step closer to the centre". This is how it keeps track of how many "1"'s it has taken across.

A honeycomb mirror is a large mirror usually used as the primary mirror in astronomical reflecting telescopes whose face is supported by a ribbed structure that resembles a honeycomb. The design provides sufficient rigidity for ultra-high precision optics while reducing the weight of the mirror. The reduced weight, in turn, allows smaller, lighter support and control structures, reducing the overall cost of the telescope. The term may also refer to mirrors made up of a coordinated set of individual hexagonal mirrors.
