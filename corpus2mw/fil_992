The player may leave a level permanently at any time, by warping out while not carrying any eggs, with no Dinos detained. By leaving the level, the player will receive a bonus for rescuing all hatchlings and all eggs, and then move on to the next level. However, if the player warps out without collecting all of the Dinos and/or eggs, points will be lost for each Dino egg and live baby Dino not collected, and the level will be repeated. The levels get progressively harder, with more snakes and spiders, and fewer logs. Level 9 is the final level; completing this level just loads level 9 again. There are two differences in level 9: The player must build two fires, instead of one, to prevent the Dino Mom from coming, and the bonus for rescuing all of the eggs and hatchling Dinos is raised from ten to fifty points. The sound effect that plays when the level is loaded is also different for level 9.

Finnix is released as a small bootable CD ISO. A user can download the ISO, burn the image to CD, and boot into a text mode Linux environment. Finnix requires at least 32Â MiB RAM to run properly, but can use more if present. Most hardware devices are detected and dealt with automatically, such as hard drives, network cards and USB devices. A user can modify files nearly anywhere on the running CD via a union mount filesystem (UnionFS or AUFS, depending on the Finnix release), stacking a read-write filesystem (in this case, a dynamic ramdisk) on top of a read-only filesystem (the CD media). Any changes made during the Finnix session are transparently written to RAM and discarded upon shutdown. In addition, Finnix uses SquashFS to keep distribution size low.
