Lian Heng was born on February 17, 1878 in Tai'nan, Taiwan. Lian grew up in a prosperous merchant family, the third son of Lien Yung-ch'ang. Lian's ancestors originated from the city of Lung Chi in the Fujian Province. The family had moved to Taiwan at the end of the Ming Dynasty as they were adamantly opposed to Manchu intrusions into China and the later foreign Qing. Born to a well-off family, Lian received an education in traditional Chinese fashion, learning Chinese characters, poetry, and the Confucian Classics. Lian gained an early interest in Chinese and Taiwanese culture and history from stories told him by his father and private tutors. With this exceptional schooling, Lian quickly developed into a young scholar-poet.
