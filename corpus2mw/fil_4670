The objective in "Zombie Gunship" is to use the AC-130's weapons systems to manually target and kill increasing waves of zombies, who are attacking humans running above-ground to the safety of a bunker. The zombies too are moving toward the bunker to overrun it. To kill zombies and protect the humans, "Zombie Gunship" makes available three upgradeable weapons: a 25mm Gatling gun, a 40mm Bofors auto-cannon, and a 105mm Howitzer cannon. Depending on the weapon, upgrading increases firing rate, speed to target, cooling rate, and damage radius.

In relations to open participation and communal evaluation is that a produsage content is often unfinished and in a continuous process of development. Since virtually all users can contribute to an existing content, there is always motivation to further improve upon it. Bruns identifies this characteristics as a stigmergic collaboration, with the example of a Wikipedia article being likened to a 'mark' or a palimpsest: a repeatedly over-written, multi-layered piece of document. Any user can have access to palimpsest and add on their contribution to the original mark. Most often, the produsage sites would offer the architectural tools to record the history of development of the materials, thus users are able to trace back the evaluation of materials through its various stages. An example is the produsage site ccMixter, a community music site using open source multimedia management system to allow users to create music remixes. The site allows the tools for retracing the music track back to its original form.
