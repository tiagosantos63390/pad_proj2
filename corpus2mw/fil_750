Although "banned in the Soviet times, Gumilev was loved for his adolescent longing for travel and giraffes and hippos, for his dreams of a fifteen-year-old captain" and was "a favorite poet among geologists, archaeologists and paleontologists."

Earle also created 3001 International and Grand Prix Design, which later morphed into Arena International Motorsport.

They returned to the BTCC running the Team Aon operation, until switching to the World Touring Car Championship for the 2012 season.
