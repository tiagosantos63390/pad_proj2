On 29 April, the convoy was spotted by a German Ju-88 reconnaissance plane as well as by German U-boats. Two days after leaving Murmansk, the convoy was attacked by several U-boats. On 30 May "U-88" and "U-436" both made unsuccessful attacks on the convoy. Later that day, however, "U-456" fired torpedoes at "Edinburgh" and scored two hits. One torpedo hit the cruiser's forward boiler room while the other hit the cruiser's stern, destroying its rudder and two of its four propellers. The "Edinburgh" was badly damaged, but still afloat. "Edinburgh" left the convoy and headed back towards Murmansk, escorted by "Foresight "and "Forester". Several ships were sent from Murmansk to assist "Edinburgh", among them the British minesweepers "Gossamer", "Harrier", "Hussar", and "Niger", the Soviet destroyers "Gremyaschi" and "Sokrushitelny", the Soviet guard ship "Rubin", and a tug.
On 4 July, violence continued with over 100 people wounded and at least two deaths, believed to be that of children. The Muslim Brotherhood's spokesman called for "strictly peaceful" protests to defy the "military coup". The Armed Forces said that it would guarantee the right to peacefully protest. Other Islamist groups threatened armed retaliation, while the police arrested four armed men on 5 July over claims that they had planned a reprisal attack, according to state-run "Al-Ahram". The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces added that it would protect all groups from revenge attacks and that Egyptian values "do not allow for gloating."
