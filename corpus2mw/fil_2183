Born into the rich and influential Morokas as the daughter of Paul Moroka, the patriarch of the advertising media firm, New Horizons and sister to Archie and Busang, half-sister to Zakes, Karabo, the only female Moroka at the time, did not have a mother figure whilst growing up. While trying to find her self, she became something of a rebel, dating men her brother and father didn't approve of, including early show villain Max Naidoo, who held a grudge against the Morokas and was hell bent on destroying them. He becomes Karabo’s boyfriend and cocaine pusher. She has always presented the façade of being calm and in control. All the men in her life have often see her as a "beauty with no brains", a myth she has since disproved in the show’s ten year run, as she now owns the biggest communications firm Ezweni which she jointly manages with ex-husband Tau Mogale and Busi Dlomo. She has been married four times, first to Mandla Sithole, a medical Doctor who was possessive and jealous of her every move, a trait that later destroyed their marriage after he drugged her and she ended up in a comma. It was later discovered that he had a tumor that caused him to act that way. Her marriage to the lovely doctor, who was also her eye surgeon, started off as more a case of dependency than love, after she was blinded by a chemical put in her eye drops by Ingid Majozi, ex-wife to her one time fiancée Glen Majozi, whose wedding to him did take place because she received news of Archie’s death in a plane crash right before the nuptials. Glen also cheated on Karabo with Kgomotso, her best friend and later on step mother who has since moved to Ivory Coast and married a man that abuses her constantly. Since then she married Kaya Motene, Tau and most recently Sibusiso Dlomo, who she has since divorced so as to allow him pursue his long term love interest, Ntombi Khumalo. In the entire series run she has lost 2 children, and all her siblings were killed off by Max Naidoo. She is currently embroiled in a custody battle for an orphaned child that she wants to adopt. Fans often wonder whether she will ever be truly happy.
Rožman was twice seen at formal and informal events chatting with SS General Erwin Rösener, the commander of German forces in the province, who ordered the execution of Slovene civilians, hostages and prisoners of war, actions which led to his name being on the indictment for war crimes at Nuremberg. From 1943 until the end of the war, Rožman was closely associated with the anti-Partisan, anti-communist "Domobranci", the Slovenian Home Guard forces formed by order of SS General Rösener on 24 September 1943.

A team of psychologists based in University College Cork recorded 31 apparition sites and explained the visions as being optical illusions caused by staring at objects in the evening twilight. Others have argued that the Moving Statues and other extraordinary, international phenomenon like the "flying-saucer" religions and many other new religious and occult movements are best explained as responses to an existential angst that was exacerbated by the Cold War and other sources of social stress but with ultimate origins in cultural or religious norms, family dynamics, and personal psychology.
