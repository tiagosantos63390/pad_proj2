Such erratics on Rügen, which are made of crystalline and metamorphic rock, that have a minimum volume of 10 m³ belong to the legally protected geotopes on the island. For most erratics, however the volume cannot be exactly worked out, because they are normally partly embedded in the ground. The sizes given in the list are based on estimates by the majority of geologists given in their publications. In addition the list shows the estimated above-ground volumes; the below-ground element is not recorded. The approiximation factor of 0.6 is based on experience and accounts for the usual difference in volume from a rectangular block.

The first match that aired in the event was a Money in the Bank Ladder Match for a World Heavyweight Championship Contract. This featured Damien Sandow, Tensai, Christian, Santino Marella, Tyson Kidd, Dolph Ziggler, Cody Rhodes and Sin Cara. Santino appeared to have a chance to win the match after giving Ziggler the Cobra but his fear of heights caused a delay which cost him a shot at retrieving the case. Cody then appeared ready to retrieve the case but he was distracted by Vickie Guerrero and that allowed Dolph to hit him with the Zig Zag. Kidd then pulled off the move of the match by knocking Dolph off the ladder with the aid of another ladder and a high-flying move. The action even took place outside of the ring as Tensai set up a ladder outside of the ring across the ring apron and power bombed Sin Cara on it. Christian appeared to be ready to retrieve the case when Ziggler used the ladder Tensai set up as a bridge back into the ring, knocked Christian off of the ladder and then grabbed the suit case.

Glennon would make his second consecutive start Week 5 against the New Orleans Saints. Glennon lead the Bucs to a 2nd half comeback, as the Bucs lead 31-20 with 13:28 to play after trailing 13-10 at half time. However, the Saints would score 11 unanswered points, which included Glennon being sacked in the endzone by Junior Galette for a safety, and a game tying field goal by Shane Graham to tie the game 31-31 and send it into overtime. The Saints wo the coin toss and capped off their first drive with an 18 yard touchdown run by Khiry Robinson, handing the Bucs a heartbreaking 37-31 loss. Despite the defeat, Glennon played well completing 19 of 32 passes for 249 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception.
