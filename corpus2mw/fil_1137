Andolsek's name will forever be linked to other NFL tragedies. In 1989, Andolsek's LSU offensive line teammate, Ralph Norwood, was killed in an automobile accident during his rookie season with the Atlanta Falcons. During the 1991 season, Detroit Lions offensive line teammate Mike Utley was paralyzed during a football game. Two days after Andolsek's death, Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident. And two years after Andolsek's death, linebacker Toby Caston was also killed in an automobile accident. Ironically, Caston was Andolsek's teammate with both LSU and the Detroit Lions.
O'Neal began his comedy career in Boston at an open mic at Estelle's Bar and Grill in October 1992. In the late 1990s, he moved to New York City, where he became a regular at the Comedy Cellar, before relocating to Los Angeles, in the hopes of finding greater fame. "I tap danced like you wouldn't believe... trying to get "something"," he said in a 2008 interview with Ron Bennington. "I'm telling you, if I'd have had a gun back then, I would have shot myself." His inability to achieve success on other people's terms motivated him to prioritize his own integrity first. "At the end of the day I just want to know that I was true to myself." Later in his career, Patrice would walk away from successful shows like "The Office", "Arrested Development", "Web Junk 20", and a writing position on the WWE. "I'm a professional bridge-burner," O'Neal stated in an interview.
