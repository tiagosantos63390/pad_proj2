1820: Hans Christian Ørsted, Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The oersted unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
NLR has developed different flight simulators for research on aircraft and helicopters. One of these simulators, the “National Simulation Facility”, is provided for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions with a movement mechanism of six degrees of freedom of the F-16 Cockpit in Mid Life Update configuration for research.

Born as Edward Jenner, Holmes Herbert emigrated to the United States in 1912. He was the first son of Ned Herbert (born Edward Jenner), who worked as an actor and comedian in the British theatre. He never made a film in his native country but managed to appear in 228 films during his career in the U.S., beginning with stalwart leading roles during the silent era and numerous supporting roles in many classic Hollywood films of the sound era, including "Captain Blood" (1935), "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (1936), "The Life of Emile Zola" (1937), "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938), and "Foreign Correspondent" (1940).

Many veterinarians use different terms to convey what is meant by "holistic". Alternative veterinary medicine, complementary veterinary medicine, and integrative veterinary medicine may be used as synonyms.

Ascospores are ellipsoidal in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with dimensions of 17–22 by 7–9 µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17 |µm. The diameter of the club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10 µm at the apex.
