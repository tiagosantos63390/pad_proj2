Today, all minor league teams are affiliated with a Major League Baseball team. However, it wasn't until the 1930s that Nashville entered into such major league affiliations. The purpose of a minor league club is to develop players for the major league team. Nashville was affiliated with six major league teams throughout its existence: the New York Giants (1934–1935 and 1952–1954), Cincinnati Reds (1936–1937 and 1955–1960), Brooklyn Dodgers (1938–1940), Chicago Cubs (1943–1951), Minnesota Twins (1961), and Los Angeles Angels (1963).
The "Dream Dice" (1998) set include the CD "Ça Va — Ça Marche — Ça Ira Encore" (1998) which includes the tracks "Ça Va — Ça Marche — Ça Ira Encore", "Tutankhama" and "Craving For Cardomon". All three tracks were released on the bootleg "Traumzeit" (1998) "Ça Va — Ça Marche — Ça Ira Encore" and "Tutankhama" were later released on "Tang-go" (2000), while "Tutankhama" was officially released only in remixed versions.

The four are suddenly sent back to 3011 and find that history has been altered: Great Britain has won the Revolutionary War and taken over all of North America, turning it into "West Britannia". In this alternate timeline, David Farnsworth killed George Washington by smothering him with his wig and was rewarded with a dukedom, making Professor Farnsworth a noble landowner and consort of the Queen of England. Having depleted the world's crystalline opal supply, Farnsworth despairs that there is no way to travel to the past to fix their mistake until he notices an opal on the queen's crown. After stealing and crushing it, the four are able to use the preserved head of David Farnsworth to return to colonial times and restore the timeline. Once they return to 3011, everything is restored as it was before history was first altered, with one change: in place of the Gadsden flag hanging in the Head Museum is a similarly designed flag displaying Bender and a colonial spelling of his catchphrase, "Bite my shiny metal ass".

The thin sidewall Geiger-Mueller tube enclosed within the brass probe body detects beta radiation and gamma radiation with the detecting probe's beta shield open, or gammas only when the shield is closed. The brass body of the probe has an energy-compensation effect on the readings taken from the probe, reducing the over-reporting of events from low-energy gamma radiation as can be encountered with non-compensated GM probes.
