Recent progress in speech production imaging, articulatory control modeling, and tongue biomechanics modeling has led to changes in the way articulatory synthesis is performed Examples include the Haskins CASY model (Configurable Articulatory Synthesis)[http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/casy.html, designed by Philip Rubin, Mark Tiede and Louis Goldstein [http://www.yale.edu/linguist/faculty/louis.html, which matches midsagittal vocal tracts to actual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and uses MRI data to construct a 3D model of the vocal tract. A full 3D articulatory synthesis model has been described by Olov Engwall. A geometrically based 3D articulatory speech synthesizer has been developed by Peter Birkholz (see vocaltraclab). The ArtiSynth project headed by Sidney Fels [http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ssfels/ at the University of British Columbia, is a 3D biomechanical modeling toolkit for the human vocal tract and upper airway. Biomechanical modeling of articulators such as the tongue has been pioneered by a number of scientists, including Reiner Wilhelms-Tricarico Yohan Payan [http://www-timc.imag.fr/Yohan.Payan/ and Jean-Michel Gerard Jianwu Dang and Kiyoshi Honda [http://iipl.jaist.ac.jp/dang-lab/en/.
