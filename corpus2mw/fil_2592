During the summer of 1991, the remaining members, with Thomas Werner, the owner of Kalemegdan Disk record label, released three Igra Stalkenih Perli LPs. The first one, "Soft Explosion Live", was Cvetić's recording of the Belgrade's College of Dentistry. In 1993, the album was re-released, reproduced and the some of the tracks were shortened and the track "Majestic End" was replaced by "Soft Explosion". The next release was "Inner Flow" which featured unreleased material recorded in the 1976 - 1979 period. The third and final German release was "Drives", which featured recordings from a four hours session recorded in April 1977, backed with rerecordings made by Rakić, Vuković and keyboard player Zoran Zagorčić (from the band Du Du A). Most of the album covers were designed by Vuković.
