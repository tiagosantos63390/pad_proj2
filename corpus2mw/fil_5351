During this period he filmed a story that touched him, recording the life of Dominic Calicchio, a craftsman who made prized trumpets working out of his Hollywood home. During World War II, when brass was in short supply, he made his own metal alloy, and continued his trade in peace-time. Dempwolf filmed him every weekend for two years and the resulting film took many awards. The Council on International Non-Theatrical Events awarded him their Golden Eagle and he took Best in Show at the Bellevue International Film Festival in Washington.

Beadle entered the Cabinet at a time when relations between the UP and the UK Labour Party were warming. He formed a good relationship with Nye Bevan, the UK Minister of Health, and put much work into attempting to create a Southern Rhodesian system similar to National Insurance in Britain. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, but did lead to a maternity grant for white mothers, nicknamed the "Beadle baby scheme". He retired from politics in 1950 to accept a seat on the High Court.
