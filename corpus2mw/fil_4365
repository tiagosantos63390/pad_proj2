The oppositely arranged yellow-green leaves are lance-shaped to oval and roughly one centimeter in length. They are hairy and glandular. The flower has a hairy, lipped corolla about 1.5 centimeters long not counting its tubular throat. It is lavender in color with a pale, dark-flecked spot on the lower lip.
