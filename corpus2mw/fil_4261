Since 1900, 99 Category 4 hurricanes have been recorded in the eastern and central Pacific basins. Of these, thirteen have attained Category 4 status on more than one occasion, by weakening to a status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale lower than Category 4 and later restrengthening into a Category 4. Such storms are demarcated by the dates they first attained and the final time they lost the intensity. Only two storms, Hurricane Fico in 1978 and Hurricane Norbert in 1984, reached Category 4 status three times or more.
