Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60mL/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests that the data for this cutoff is slim and that a cutoff of CrCl < 40mL/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers Criteria.

17α-Hydroxylase deficiency in genetic males (XY) results in moderate to severe reduction of fetal testosterone production by both adrenals and testes. Undervirilization is variable and sometimes complete. The appearance of the external genitalia ranges from normal female to ambiguous to mildly underdeveloped male. The most commonly described phenotype is a small phallus, perineal hypospadias, small blind pseudovaginal pouch, and intra-abdominal or inguinal testes. Wolffian duct derivatives are hypoplastic or normal, depending on degree of testosterone deficiency. Some of those with partial virilization develop gynecomastia at puberty even though masculinization is reduced. The presence of hypertension in the majority distinguishes them from other forms of partial androgen deficiency or insensitivity. Fertility is impaired in those with more than minimal testoserone deficiency.
"Electronic Gaming Monthly" gave the Atari Jaguar version an average of 6 out of 10. Their four reviewers agreed that it was virtually identical to the arcade version, but were divided about the quality of the game itself. Two of them described "Raiden" as "above average", and two described it as mediocre, saying that the ship moves too slow, enemy fire often blends in with the background, and the graphics are subpar given the Jaguar's capabilities. "GamePro" similarly criticized that the gameplay is outdated, the ship moves too slow, and that the graphics do not live up to the Jaguar's potential. They concluded that "A snoozer like "Raiden" just seems out of place on a powerful system like the Jaguar."

Lieutenant Henry Allen of the U.S. Army explored the river in 1887. He named it the Cantwell River after Lieutenant John C. Cantwell, of the Revenue Cutter Service, who had explored the Kobuk River region in 1884–85. In 1898, members of the United States Geological Survey reported that people living along the river called it "Tutlut". However, the local Tanana name was spelled "Nenana" on a later map. A century later, linguist William Bright wrote that the river's name derived from the Lower Tanana (Athabascan) word, "neenano"', meaning the "stopping-while-migrating stream".
