In terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 Henry Fuseli was working on a translation of J.C. Lavater's "Aphorisms on Man" for the publisher Joseph Johnson, when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them. Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of "Aphorisms", and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both "All Religions" and "No Natural Religion". S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;
Thus, the best alternative (in the maximization case) is alternative "A"2 (because it has the maximum WSM score which is equal to 22.00). Furthermore, these numerical results imply the following ranking of these three alternatives: "A"2 = "A"3 > "A"1 (where the symbol ">" stands for "better than").
