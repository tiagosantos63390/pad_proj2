MOLCAS is an ab initio computational chemistry program, developed at Lund University in collaboration with others. Focus in the program is placed on methods for calculating general electronic structures in molecular systems in both ground and excited states. MOLCAS is, in particular, designed to study the potential surfaces of excited states.
