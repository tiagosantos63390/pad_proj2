Projections for after 2050 have usually assumed that fertility rates will have declined by then and the population will be stable or will decrease. However, a study in 2014 found that fertility rates in Africa have leveled off at around 4.6 instead of continuing to decline, and that consequently world population may be as high as 12 300 million by 2100. Reasons for the continuing high fertility rate include better survival rates with respect to HIV, and lack of availability of contraception. Another study on the other hand concludes that education of women will lead to low fertility rates even in Africa.
In 1991, a 2,000-pound (910 kg) stallion she was riding at a horse show lost its footing and fell while her left foot was still in a stirrup, crushing every bone in her foot and causing nerve damage. Doctors told her she would likely not ever walk normally again. The following week, she was again riding, and 10 weeks later she resumed competing. In 1992, a 1,200-pound (540 kg) horse fell on her at a show, breaking four of her ribs, and trampled her trying to get up, slicing open a foot-long gash in her back from her shoulder blade on down with his steel cleats. In July 1998, a horse that she was riding stumbled on a jump, and she smashed her face, broke her nose, required 40 stitches, and could only see out of one of her eyes. She rode the next day. She has also fractured her left shoulder, and broken her collarbone twice, her arm, her wrist, and two fingers.
