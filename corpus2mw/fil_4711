The Alabama National Guard, which became one of the first states to participate in the SPP, has witnessed the fruits of its enduring relationship with the Romanian military. Army Maj. Gen. Perry G. Smith, the Alabama Adjutant General, said his soldiers and airmen have taught the Romanians skills acquired during combat deployments and as well as those learned by responding to Hurricane Katrina and other disasters at home. Smith noted that on one day in April 2011, the state suffered 58 tornadoes, requiring him to activate 3,000 National Guardsmen to assist in response efforts. This has given the Alabama Guard solid experience to share with the Romanian military, Smith said, including its processes for providing defense support to civilian authorities and the courses-of-action development process the military uses to present commanders with decision-making options. The two countries’ special operators, military police, infantry and logistics elements work together through the program.

During the trial, some lawyers believed that VietinBank, where Nhu worked for and used its credentials to the scheme, must take responsibility for the swindling case and compensate the victims in the case. However, VietinBank has denied its responsibility in the case, stating that the institutions and individuals were cheated when dealing with Nhu personally, not VietinBank. Meanwhile, the bank’s computing system was only the instrument for Nhu to implement her cheating. The amount expected to be lost from this case was roughly 3200 billion VND (equivalent of 150 million dollars).
