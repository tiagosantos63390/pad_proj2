The plaintiffs, Mike and Chantell Sackett, purchased, approximately, a two-third acre parcel of land (0.62) near Priest Lake, Idaho, on which they planned to build a house. Shortly after they began clearing the lot, the Sacketts received a Compliance Order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, asserting that the property was subject to the Clean Water Act, and that the Sacketts had illegally placed fill material into jurisdictional wetlands on their property. After trying unsuccessfully to obtain a hearing from the EPA, the Sacketts filed suit demanding an opportunity to contest the jurisdictional basis of the Compliance Order. Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the government, holding that the validity of the Compliance Order could be challenged only if and when EPA brings an enforcement action seeking to impose civil and criminal penalties against the Sacketts. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, limited to the following questions: "1. May petitioners seek pre-enforcement judicial review of the administrative compliance order pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. §704? 2. If not, does petitioners' inability to seek preenforcement judicial review of the administrative compliance order violate their rights under the Due Process clause?"

Education.
Sugiyama is best known for his work with Tagawa and Toda introducing layered graph drawing, now also known as Sugiyama-style graph drawing. Sugiyama also wrote highly cited papers on other topics in graph drawing including maintenance of the "mental map" when a drawing is modified, drawings that simultaneously display both the adjacencies between vertices in a graph and a hierarchical structure on the same vertices, and the control of edge orientations in force-based algorithms.
