In 2013, a video was leaked of Cal Wenzel the CEO and founder of Shane Homes speaking to panel of Calgarian home builders about a plan to influence the decisions of the city council after the upcoming elections. In the video Wenzel spoke of plans to raise $1.1 million to enlist the support of Preston Manning's conservative foundation the Manning Centre for Building Democracy.

Wenzel named councillors the industry could rely on to support motions in favor of the lobby and he supported with donations.
