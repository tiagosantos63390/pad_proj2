One theory is glycolaldehyde formed on the surface of dust grains. Dust grains allow molecules to grow and react, such as hydrogenation in the case of glycolaldehyde. A particular research group focused on constant temperature collapse of massive molecular cores. When conditions like decreased temperature and appropriate densities, similar to those of massive cores, are considered, only a few reactions supported grain-surface synthesis. A theorized intermediate is formyl radical (CHO). This intermediate is a well-known compound to exist in cold, photon-dominated regions of stellar clouds. HCO is theorized to have reacted with itself on a grain of dust and gained hydrogen's forming glycolaldehyde. The star must maintain lower temperatures for this theory to be plausible, and the longer the star collapses at this temperature (3-15 K) the more time for complicated compound to form.
