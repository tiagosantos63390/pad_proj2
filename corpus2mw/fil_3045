Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed by bassist Steve Harris in 1975. The band's first album, 1980's "Iron Maiden" was written primarily by Harris, with vocalist Paul Di'Anno co-writing two tracks and guitarist Dave Murray contributing "Charlotte the Harlot". The 1981 follow-up, "Killers", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, "Killers" (North American bonus track "Twilight Zone" was credited to Harris and Murray). Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of "Killers", although did not contribute any songwriting to "The Number of the Beast", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. "The Number of the Beast" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of "Run to the Hills", which charted at number seven upon its release. It was not until 1983's "Piece of Mind" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned "Flight of Icarus" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock chart.

However, John Rentoul from the UK's "The Independent", who describes himself as an "ultra Blairite with a slavish admiration for Tony", and John Rosenthal, from the conservative Pajamas Media, both denounced the film because it was made with financial support from the German government. Rentoul also launched a scathing attack on Polanski describing the winner of Berlin's Silver Bear as "propaganda" and a "Blair hating movie". Still, what the critics did not explain was that although the production company, Elfte Babelsberg Film GmbH, received €3.5 million from the German state, any major film production within Germany is entitled to apply for financial assistance from the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF); the grant is not required to be repaid.

Their design failed to match the monumentality of the Heinrichshof opposite (destroyed in World War II, and in 1955 replaced by the Opernringhof). Criticism from both the Emperor and a press campaign against the pair of architects described the disappointment of the Viennese public and suggested that the building was merely a half-success. After the street level in front of the opera house was raised by a metre, the opera was described as the "sunken chest" and - in analogy to the military disaster of 1866 - "the Königgratz of Construction".
