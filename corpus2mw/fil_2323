On the site where CRC now stands, the Lake Norconian Resort opened in 1929 as "the opulent playground of some of Hollywood's biggest names." The Norconian hotel closed in 1940, then served as a Navy hospital between 1941 and 1957. "The old Norconian and several of the newer outlying buildings were turned over to the state" to create CRC, and the first inmates arrived in January 1963; however, in 2002 "CRC vacated the building after learning it had to be seismically retrofitted." Efforts are underway to preserve the hotel.
