When the heroes arrive on the planet, Moondragon scans Jack's mind and detects a single word: "Infinites". The heroes are then attacked by thousands of robots, and eventually retreat via ship into space as the artificial life forms seem to be forming from the planet itself. Moondragon continues to scan Jack's mind and learns the robots' purpose is to break down the entire planet into a molten mass.

Furthermore, in a review of available research, the Transportation Research Board (part of the United States National Research Council) states "conclusive evidence could be found to support or reject the use of differential speed limits for passenger cars and heavy trucks" (page 11) and "a strong case cannot be made on empirical grounds in support of or in opposition to differential speed limits" (page 109).
