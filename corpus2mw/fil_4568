De zwarte mens was in geen van deze teksten de protagonist. Het spectatoriale geschrift "De denker" uit 1774 introduceerde met de "Geschiedenis van een neger" het zwarte perspectief door het woord te geven aan een Afrikaan die op subtiele wijze het slavernijsysteem over de hekel haalde. Waarschijnlijk hanteerde een witte schrijver zijn pennenveer. Wie zeker voor zichzelf sprak, was Quassie van Timotibo, die met zijn eruditie veler bewondering afdwong. Vanwege zijn collaboratie met de koloniale macht lange tijd beschouwd als een dubieuze figuur, wordt hij nu meer en meer gezien als de verpersoonlijking van een even intelligent als brutaal verzet tegen het systeem dat hem wilde knechten.

In 1921, William I. Nolan and George R. Wicker introduced a bill (Wicker-Nolan Bill) to create a State Public Safety Commission to co-ordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers. The bill passed the Senate 41 to 22. Minnesota Governor J. A. O. Preus supported the bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. In a special message to the 1921 Legislature Governor J. A. O. Preus opened the CA's long campaign for a state constabulary. A "terrific" wave of crime was sweeping across the nation, and a state constabulary was the only way to deal with it effectively. CA publications supported Preus's efforts to stomp out the new wave of youthful criminals that was attributed to movies, pool halls, and war experience. Preus supported a bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. Despite a clause that the force "shall not be employed in strikes arising out of labor controversies between employers and employees;' the legislature, probably realizing that labor opposition would doom the bill, ignored Preus's effort. Instead William I. Nolan and George Wicker introduced a bill to create a State Public Safety Commission to coordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers.
