The classic lottery is a drawing in which each contestant buys a combination of numbers. Each combination of numbers, or "play", is usually priced at $1. Plays are usually non-exclusive, meaning that two or more ticket holders may buy the same combination. The lottery organization then draws the winning combination of 5-8 numbers, usually from 1 to 50, using a randomized, automatic ball tumbler machine.

In 1971 Ewen's working method and imagery changed dramatically. He started working on plywood instead of canvas. The new pieces were physically large, often using several standard 4' x 8' sheets of plywood side by side. Ewan used a router to gouge out the surface, and attached objects to the surface with hardware. In the shallow three-dimensional surface he had created, Ewen then painted powerful images that grew out of his boyhood interests in geology and space.
The State Capitol is largely surrounded by state government buildings. The numerous parks, walking trails, and monuments on the grounds give visitors information concerning the state's history, making it one of the city's tourist attractions. Six buildings currently exist on the grounds; all were built during various time periods as the government grew. Not all state agencies are housed on the grounds, however: a large number of them are spread throughout the city in various facilities. Plans for a massive expansion and improvement of the grounds were developed in 2000, but very little of the plan has been implemented as of 2012.

From April 18 to April 28, Farragut bombarded and then fought his way past the forts in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, managing to get thirteen ships upriver on April 24. Historian John D. Winters in "The Civil War in Louisiana" (1963) noted that with few exceptions the Confederate fleet at New Orleans had "made a sorry showing. Self-destruction, lack of co-operation, cowardice of untrained officers, and the murderous fire of the Federal gunboats reduced the fleet to a demoralized shambles."
