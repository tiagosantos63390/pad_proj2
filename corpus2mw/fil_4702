The park was transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union following World War II in 1945. The Soviet administration expanded it with land from nearby cemeteries and renamed it after Mikhail Kalinin. Now known as Kaliningrad Central Park, it contains monuments of Baron MÃ¼nchhausen and Vladimir Vysotsky, as well some pre-war German architecture.

The sequel was announced following the huge critical success of the first part, "Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster". It was announced that Jimmy Shergill and Mahi Gill would be reprising their roles from the original film. In January 2012, Neil Nitin Mukesh was signed on to play the new gangster. However, due to differences between Mukesh and the film's producers, Mukesh was dropped from the part and Irrfan Khan was cast instead. Later in March, Soha Ali Khan was confirmed to play Irrfan Khan's love interest. Raj Babbar was soon cast to play the role of Soha Ali's father. Actress Neha Dhupia was to appear in an item number, but due to date issues, Mugdha Godse was signed instead.
