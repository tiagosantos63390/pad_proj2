The promising application in purification of biotechnological products is based on the fact that biopolymers are difficult for filtration but on the other hand they are usually charged as a result of the presence of amino and carboxyl groups. The objective of electrofiltration is to prevent the formation of filter cake and to improve the filtration kinetic of products difficult to filtrate.

It is one of the very few manuscripts that are destitute of Liturgical apparatus. The style of the handwriting is unformed, the absence of all notes, κεφαλαια ("chapters"), etc. The only traces of which are red capitals in the marginal mark at John 13:31. The breathings and accents are complete and tolerably correct. There is no ι subscriptum but ι adscriptum in Mark 14:14; John 5:22 and in few other places. Itacisms are more frequent than in Codex 470. Erasures and corrections by a later hand exist, but are not very frequent. One of the most remarkable errors of scribe Scrivener noticed in Mark 2:12 and Mark 6:55 – κραβατγον (instead of κραβαττον).

The library's archives have been described as "comparatively well housed" but "endangered [...] through frequent and heavy use and [...] through risk of being washed away in a cyclone-prone area. Environmental and handling damage is occurring to key customary records". This has resulted in the Tuvalu National Archives preservation pilot project (EAP005) and Tuvalu National Archives major project of 2005, projects of the British Library and the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau of the ANU Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University to microfilm and digitally copy the archives.
