With the release of the 2014 season schedule, the league stated that teams play 28 games with a maximum of four games played against any single opponent. Each team will also play two games against MLS reserve teams; the games will count equally in the standings with those played against league competition. The 2014 USL PRO Playoffs include the top eight finishers in the table. The semifinals featuring the four remaining teams are played the following weekend, followed by the USL PRO Championship. All playoff rounds feature a single-game knockout format.
Benelux' Next Top Model (cycle 2)
The towns and cities of Downstate New York were created by the U.S. state of New York as municipalities in order to give residents more direct say over local government. Present-day Westchester, Bronx, New York, Richmond, Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties were part of York Shire from 1664-August 1673 and again from February 1674 until 1683 at which point the Province of New York was divided into counties. From August 1673 to February 1674 New York was under Dutch control and English political units were suspended, then restored under English rule. York Shire was divided into three divisions called ridings, the East, West, and North ridings. In 1683 the colony of New York eliminated shires and ridings in favor of counties, the East Riding becoming Suffolk County, West Riding the counties of Richmond and Kings, while the North Riding became the counties of Westchester (including present-day Bronx), New York, and Queens (including present-day Nassau).
