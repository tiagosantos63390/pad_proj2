The Cowleys operated Big Spring Cafe until selling it to their daughter, Pam Milam, in 1992. Citing the age and condition of the current building, Milam announced in March 2008 that she planned to relocate Big Spring Cafe just west on Governors Drive, in "a year or so", taking care to replicate the interior of the cafe in the new location. , that move has yet to take place.

The appropriation meant the removal of all traces of the Armenian history of the church: The metal Armenian ornamental crosses remained intact on the church's two cupolas until 1990; In April 1990, the crosses that were seen as "Armenian" were removed; In March–April 1990, the church's main altar and another smaller altar used for baptism were destroyed; A khachkar with an inscription that was part of an interior wall was removed sometime between 1990 and 1991; Also, the Armenian inscription on the wall of the northern entrance that attests to the 1753 construction of the church disappeared in 1990.
