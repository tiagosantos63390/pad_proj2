The police were informed of the hijacking at 16:55 and immediately scrambled troops to Bulltofta to deal with the situation. Organized by the police superintendent of duty in Malmö, a low-profile police action was ordered, where no police officer should attempt any offensive action without prior orders. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer was alerted at 18:20. He was vacationing at his cabin in Ystad Municipality, located only kilometers from the airport, and was able to quickly arrive at the scene. Once briefed, he called a cabinet conference by alerting Prime Minister Olof Palme. Meanwhile the National Police Board dispatched several of its members to the airport. Its leader, Carl Persson, joined the crisis cabinet. They decided to avoid use of force and instead attempt to tire out the hijackers through the extending negotiations.

"Five Short Graybles" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, and Cole Sanchez, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. This was the first episode that Page worked on for the series; he was so excited that after he finished the storyboard, he travelled to Hawaii to "treat himself". Page had been hired by Ward largely due to how he storyboarded the initial high-five between Finn and Jake, which Ward found humorous. Ward had to cute a high-five out of a previous episode that had been produced, which he was unhappy about. He later jokingly said via his Twitter that he would make an episode entirely about high-fives. Eventually, this joke turned into "Five Short Graybles". Sanchez boarded the scenes with Ice King, as well as the scenes with Lumpy Space Princess. He later noted that the two sections were united by the fact that they both featured characters who were "being a little bit mean to each other".

In 1957 and 1958, she was cast in two other western series, as Rose in "The Town" of the CBS series "Trackdown", starring Robert Culp and in the segment "Iron Trail Ambush" of the syndicated "Frontier Doctor", starring Rex Allen. Her last acting role was in 1960 as a mystery woman on the ABC sitcom, "The Donna Reed Show".
