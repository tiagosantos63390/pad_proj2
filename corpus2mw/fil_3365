Clarke and Macrae took their prototype to Bedford Modern School baths, which were closed for such occasions. Clarke was an excellent swimmer and was able to propel himself through the water with a prototype bomb attached to a keeper plate on webbing around his waist. Clarke practised attaching the bomb to a metal griddle plate taken from the family kitchen that was used to simulate the hull of a ship. At first, the magnetic adhesion to the keeper plate proved so great that it was difficult to remove the bomb, so the plate was made smaller to reduce the strength of its hold. They also adjusted the bomb to have a slightly positive buoyancy, which was found to be advantageous. Having developed the weapon thus far, it was duly named the limpet mine after the marine sea creature â€“ the limpet, a gastropod well known for its ability to adhere to rocks.
In 1980, Hallett's work helped shape the basis for City Fair, a major alternative technology fair, in Seattle, Wash.
