The PIC, upon its formation, took votes away from the ruling liberal party. It also stirred up such a conflict that President José Miguel Gomez was forced to take action. Gomez ordered the party disbanded under the Morúa law which outlawed political parties based on race.(Perez(1), 168) The Morúa law was aimed at creating the illusion Cuban nationalism while favoring the white Cubans. The Cuban white supremacist social construct was meant to repress the Afro Cubans. In some ways it was successful such as keeping the Afro Cubans from holding political office. The Afro Cubans also found ways to use the system to their advantage. They used the nationalist system to acquire education claiming that if there was no race division in Cuba they should be able to get a degree just like any other Cuban. This mindset allowed the Afro Cubans to use the nationalism, created to oppress them, to their advantage.(Fuente, 67)
