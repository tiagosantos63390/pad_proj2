Lesser Wax Moths are very common in most parts of the world, except the colder regions, aided in their spread by humans who have involuntarily introduced them to many countries. They are known or suspected to inhabit most of Africa (including Madagascar), Australia, Europe (expect perhaps some more remote regions, particularly in Greece) and North America, as well as parts of the Neotropics (at least Colombia, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Trinidad), the Bengal region, Japan, Sri Lanka, and the Marquesas Islands and Tahiti in French Polynesia.
Stockhausen also prepared a number of versions for various specific forces: vocal versions for five different voice ranges (high soprano or high tenor, Nr. 41⅔; soprano or tenor, Nr. 41¾; mezzosoprano, alto, or low tenor, Nr 41⅘; baritone, Nr. 41⅚; bass, Nr. 416/7 all 1975), version for chamber orchestra, Nr. 41 7/8 (1977), version for clarinet and piano, Nr. 418/9 (1981), a "trio version" for clarinet, flute/piccolo, and trumpet/piano, Nr. 419/10 (1983), a "version 2003" for soprano or tenor with chording instrument, Nr. 41 10/11 (2003), and, finally, two orchestral versions of five melodies each, titled "Fünf Sternzeichen", Nr. 4111/12, and "Fünf weitere Sternzeichen", N. 4112/13. The latter was his last completed composition, finished on 4 December 2007, the night before he died (Bäumer 2007). Stockhausen was planning further work in January 2008, which was probably the orchestration of the remaining two pieces, "Cancer" and "Leo" (Kohl 2012, 520–21).
Tao Fong Shan Christian Centre (Chinese: 道風山基督教叢林) is situated at Tao Fong Shan, Sha Tin, in Hong Kong. The Centre was founded in 1930 by the Norwegian missionary Karl Ludvig Reichelt (1877–1952). Reichelt was sent to Hunan province in China in 1904. There he gradually developed an idea to share the gospel with Buddhists. In 1929, he established Jing Fong Shan in Nanjing. In 1930, due to the chaos of the Chinese civil war, Reichelt moved his work to Sha Tin, Hong Kong, and asked a Danish architect, Johannes Prip-Moller to design the buildings. Reichelt died on 13 March 1952 and was buried at the Tao Fong Shan cemetery.
