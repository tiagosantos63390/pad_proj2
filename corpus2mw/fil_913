Puuwai (literally, ""heart"" in Hawaiian) is an unincorporated community in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States, and the only settlement on the island of Niihau. It is at the western coast of the small island, and Native Hawaiians who live in this village speak the Hawaiian language. The community lives as they did hundreds of years ago, and the modern amenities of life are extremely limited. Access to the town (as well as the whole island) is limited to Niihau residents. Only official visitors and invited guests are permitted. Puuwai has a one-room schoolhouse. Niihau is located about west of Kauai.

Among their postseason highlights was the May 20, 1975, game three of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals. This game, known as the fog game, was memorable because Buffalo Memorial Auditorium had no air conditioning and the arena temperature matched the 90 degree outdoor temperature, which caused fog to shroud the ice surface. During the overtime, play was delayed seven times due to fog on the ice surface at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The players were instructed by Flyer coach Fred Shero and Sabre coach Floyd Smith to shoot whenever possible because of the impaired goaltender vision.

Ronnie Lott would later state that a head-on-collision he had with Andrews during a game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Falcons on December 19, 1982 was the hardest hit that he had received during his NFL career. In addition to leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 1981, Andrews also finished in the top four in that category three other times. Despite the brevity of his career, Andrews is still the Falcons' all-time yards from scrimmage leader with a total of 8,633. He was named as the Falcons Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1983.
