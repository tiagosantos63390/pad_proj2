The VUL supports Touring (Club) teams, Furious George, Blackfish, Traffic, Zephyr and more. The primary goal of these teams is to compete in elite ultimate tournaments, especially provincial, national and international championships. Vancouver teams have had significant success at these events, winning multiple medals on the national and international stage. As a result in large part due to Vancouver players in the team of Furious George, Canada is currently ranked number one in the world, according to the World Flying Disc Federation.
While studying under Dmitri Shostakovich at the Leningrad Conservatory (1939–1941), he began a one-act opera "Rothschild's Violin" based on Anton Chekhov’s short story about Bronza, a Russian country coffin-maker and violinist, and his combative relationship with the Jewish musicians in his village.

WSAR was licensed in June 1923 (although in one 1940s station publication, the station claimed September 21, 1921) with the sequentially-issued callsign of WSAR. WSAR's original owner was the Doughty & Welch Electric Company. WSAR's first air date was July 3, 1923. WSAR first operated on 1180kc with 10 watts. It would stay on 1180 through 1926. Power in 1926 was 100 watts. WSAR then moved to Portsmouth, Rhode Island and changed frequency to 1190kc, still with 100 watts, by June 30, 1927. WSAR moved back to Fall River and changed frequency again, to 1410kc, in 1928. During the late 1920s the power was increased to 1,000 watts. An early slogan used by WSAR (sometime between 1926 and 1932) was "Fall River Looms Up."
