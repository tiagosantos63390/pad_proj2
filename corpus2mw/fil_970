Wortham Giant Screen Theatre, a 394-seat theater presenting various educational films in 4K digital with advanced 3D technology on its 60x80 foot screen.
The peal of bells originally hung in the south of the two towers in the "Glockenstube" (bell room) 60 meters high. In World War II, the Palm Sunday air raid created a firestorm with winds strong enough to ring the bells before they fell down. Two bells, the oldest one of 1508 and the "Pulsglocke" of 1668, donated by Christian von der Linde (weighing 7134Â kg), have been left in pieces as a stark memorial.
The then Romanesque cathedral was completed around 1230, but between 1266 and 1335 it was converted into a Gothic-style building with side-aisles raised to the same height as the main aisle (around 20m).
