Okoye was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, a member of the Igbo ethnic group. He moved to Huntsville, Alabama in the United States when he was 12 years old. After only spending two weeks in middle school, he tested into the 9th grade. He first started playing football as a sophomore at Lee High School, knowing virtually nothing about the game before his high school coach suggested he go play "Madden NFL" football to learn. By the time he was a senior, he won first-team All-State honors as both a defensive lineman and offensive lineman. Because he shares the same surname as former Kansas City Chiefs running back Christian Okoye, some sources have claimed that the two are related. Amobi says they are not related, but the two families live on adjoining land in Nigeria.

Using radio modems is a modern way to create Private Radio Networks (PRN). Private radio networks are used in industrial critical applications, when real-time data communication is needed. Also Radio Data Modem enables user to be independent of telecommunication or satellite network operators. In most cases users use licensed frequencies either in UHF or VHF band. Licensed frequency is reserved for given user in certain area thus ensuring that there is less likelihood to have radio interference from other RF transmitters. Also licence free frequencies are available in most countries, enabling easy implementation, but at the same time other users may use same frequency, thus making it possible that given frequency is blocked.
