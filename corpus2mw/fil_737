According to a medieval tradition, Wakering (probably Great Wakering) was the site of a monastery during the seventh century AD. Two Christian cousins of King Ecgberht of Kent, named Aethelred and Aethelberht, were murdered at Eastry, a royal dwelling in the Kingdom of Kent, during King Ecgberht's reign (664-673). They were prevented by a miracle from being buried at Canterbury, and were taken instead to an existing monastery at Wakering in the Kingdom of Essex and enshrined there as saints. Ecgberht's brother and successor King Hlothhere of Kent is said by William of Malmesbury to have ridiculed the idea of their sanctity.

The 'Newmarket Railway' was built by the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway with the first section from Newmarket to (and on to meet the West Anglia Main Line at Great Chesterford) opened in 1848, followed by a section from Six Mile Bottom to Cambridge in 1851.
At its simplest, "Ca phe da" is made with coarsely ground Vietnamese-grown dark roast coffee individually brewed with a small metal French drip filter ("cà phê phin") into a cup containing about a quarter to a half as much sweetened condensed milk, stirred and poured over ice. The coarse grind allows the use of the "cà phê phin".
