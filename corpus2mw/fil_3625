Players begin by creating a character. After choosing a name and gender, a number of questions lead a basic distribution of attribute points. These questions have five possible answers. One of the five answers provides no benefit at the end of character creation, while each of the other four will increase different attributes. The final part of the character creation allows the player to "roll" attribute scores. This function is not limited, so a player may choose to use it again until they seem to fit; however, the maximum value of the character's attributes is limited by the player's responses to the preceding questions.
