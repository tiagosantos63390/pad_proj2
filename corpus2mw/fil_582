Transformers: Armada.

The Parliament voted in favour of not presenting the referendum question before the Constitutional Court. However, after the Parliament had set the date for the referendum, every Croatian citizen had the right to do so. Three organisations (Zagreb Pride, Centre For Civil Courage, and CroL) did bring the case before the Court. The Constitutional Court decided against them, stating that there was no legal basis for banning the referendum. The Court also stated that, should the citizens support inclusion of the definition of marriage as a union between a woman and a man in the Constitution, that would have no negative effect on future laws regarding same-sex couples, or non-married opposite-sex couples. Conservative Ex-Prime Minister, once a member of right-wing HDZ, and now an independent MP Jadranka Kosor voted in favour of presenting the question before the Constitutional Court, and voted against the proposed Constitutional change on a referendum. This statement was not in line with her previous views on homosexuality and same-sex marriages. She is known for being against the expansion of rights for same-sex couples in the past, and was voted the "homophobe of the year" in 2010 after stating that homosexuality is not natural, and that same-sex marriages should never be legal. She also supported the Life Partnership Act.
