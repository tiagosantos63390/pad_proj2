Carrowmore Lake is situated in the parishes of Kiltane and Kilcommon Erris, County Mayo between the villages of Bangor Erris and Barnatra at the southern end of Broadhaven Bay. The freshwater lake is over four miles long and almost 3 miles wide at its widest point. Glencullen townlands line its eastern shore and Rathmorgan and the Knocknascollop mountains rise up along its western shores. Carrowmore is not a deep lake and it provides the drinking water for the whole of the Erris area. It is fed by the Carrowmore River and drains into the Owenmore River on its way to Blacksod Bay,

Paleoseismological studies of the SWIF are scant. One study compared the relative elevation of two marshes on opposite sides of Whidbey Island, and determined that approximately 3,000 years ago an earthquake of M 6.5—7.0 caused 1 to 2 meters of uplift. Another study identified an unusually broad band of scarps passing between Bothell and Snohomish, with several scarps in the vicinity of King County's controversial Brightwater regional sewage treatment plant showing at least four and possibly nine events on the SWIF in the last 16,400 years. Such seismic hazards were a major issue in the siting of the plant, as it is tucked between two active strands, and the influent and effluent pipelines cross multiple zones of disturbed ground.

The Golden Leopard is the top prize at the Locarno International Film Festival, an international film festival held annually in Locarno, Switzerland since 1946. Directors in the process of getting an international reputation are allowed to be entered in the competitive selection. The winning films are chosen by a jury. The award went under many names until it was named the "Golden Leopard" in 1968. The festival was not held in 1951 and the prize was not awarded in 1956 and 1982. As of 2009 René Clair & Jiří Trnka are the only two directors to have won the award twice, both of them winning in consecutive years.
