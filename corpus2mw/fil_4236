At age 16, Xavier purchased his first keyboard which helped him hone his productions skills and prepare him for his opportunity to study music and produce records at FlyteTyme Studio, the studio belonging to the legendary Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. “The time I spent at Flyte Tyme was essential to my growth as a music producer and artist.
