The Queen is a primary character in the Disneyland rides Snow White's Scary Adventures (first opened in 1955), where she is seen more than any other character in all four versions of the ride, recreating a number of scenes from the film, sometimes including the torture chamber from an abandoned concept, with "a few skeletons of her past victims." In one new scene, she turns into a hag while standing in front of the mirror (back to the visitors) and intoning: "Magic Mirror on the wall, with this disguise I'll fool them all!" She also appears in her hag form at the roller coaster Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, first opened in 2014.

Stephenson won the league title with Warriors in 1968, which was the first time in the club's history.

Gerda and Orm (troll) encountered pirates, lead by the pirate lade, who took them to their stranded pirate ship. The pirate lady's daughter decided to take Gerda and Orm for questioning. When Gerda said that the pirates cannot sail due to the Snow Queen, the pirate lady decided to hang Orm after she assumed that he was a talking dog. However, Gerda stood up for Orm, and said that he is going to help her defeat the Snow Queen, and bring the ocean back to normal so that the pirates can sail once more. The pirates lady's daughter believed that Gerda was right, and decided to give them their reindeer Ragnar to head forth to the Snow Queen.
