Early life.
The in-game graphics in the PC version paled in comparison to the still-screen graphics it had. This was due to polygonal graphics being used as opposed to sprites, rendering the car, track, and trackside details in untextured 3D polygons.
From that time he dropped his first name and was always known as Stacy Waddy. After acting for a short period as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the difficult parish of Stockton, New South Wales on the other side of the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, "Come for Strength", published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was boundless, as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102. Had he accepted the suggestion that he should get a position in Sydney and play cricket, it is likely that he would have gained a place in the New South Wales eleven.

Sammy-Lee decided to leave "Neighbours" and Wayne departed in 1994. He told Monroe that he never intended to remain in the role long and feared becoming type-cast as a soap actor. Writers planned Wayne's exit to coincide with stories leading to Sarah Vandenbergh's exit as Lauren Carpenter. Wayne and Lauren begin a casual relationship in New Year 1994. Wayne's "matchmaking" brother, Troy (Damian Walshe-Howling) tricks the pair into dating. When Lauren gets drunk at a dinner party, Wayne offers to walk her home and she pulls him over her doorstep and kisses him as their friends stare. Sammy-Lee revealed "Then, when she invites him in for coffee, she spills milk on her blouse and takes it off. Wayne does the gentlemanly thing by covering her up with his jacket and putting her to bed. But Lauren reads more into it." The following morning, Lauren assumes she has had sex with Wayne and forgot what actually happened. The truth is eventually revealed to Lauren and the misunderstanding gave their romance "a shaky start". Fletcher commented that friendship turned to lust for both characters during the storyline. The storyline completed a recurring theme of relationship storyline Sammy-Lee played out. He told Fletcher that "Wayne can't control his hormones. In just a year in Eringborough there isn't a girl he hasn't tried to date. As long as they're pretty, he'll fall for them." Sammy-Lee concluded that after Wayne's long line of women, his fellow cast mates created a running joke that he was only left his relative Helen left to seduce. His final scenes showed Wayne deciding to move back to live on his farm.
