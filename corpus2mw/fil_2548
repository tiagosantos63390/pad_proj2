As part of an ongoing collaboration with Motoman Robotics, a division of Yaskawa America, Inc., Universal launched MotoSightâ„¢ 3D Spatial Vision, a 3D vision system for cost-effective, flexible and scalable real-time guidance for Motoman robots. The system determines six degrees of object position and pose information (X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz) and is accurate within 2-4mm with off-the-shelf Logitech 9000 webcams. Accuracy can be improved by substituting webcams with GigE cameras.
