"Final" provides 101 playable ships, including altered versions of ships appearing in previous "R-Type" games, together with many original ones. They are unlocked through a branching system accessed via the R Museum, which was originally featured in "R-Types". The PlayStation 2's internal clock is incorporated into each ship's development history (shown through a commemorative plaque) when certain in-game tasks are completed. For example, ships unlocked in 2008 will be seen in the game as having been rolled out in 2168.
