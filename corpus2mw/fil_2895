A horse's genotype may be "lp/lp" (homozygous recessive), "Lp/lp" (heterozygous), or "Lp/Lp" (homozygous dominant). Horses without a dominant "Lp" gene do not exhibit leopard-complex traits, and cannot produce offspring with the "Lp" gene unless it is contributed by the other parent. Such horses are termed "non-characteristic" among Appaloosa horse aficionados. Horses with at least one "Lp" gene possess, at the very least, leopard-complex "characteristics":
