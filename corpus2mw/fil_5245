Philippide, together with many other "Junimists" and Iași academics such as Stere, favored the Central Powers for the first two years of World War I, during which interval Romania remained neutral. His cooperation with Stere deepened: in early 1916, he supported Stere's bid to return as Rector of Iași University, and ran on the same list as him. Although Philippide gathered most votes, the list overall lost as a result of government opposition and intrigue. The "Germanophile" party lost, as, in 1916, Romania joined the Entente; after the German counteroffensive, Bucharest was occupied and Iași became the provisional capital of a rump Romanian state. Between October 1916 and spring 1919, Iași University virtually ceased functioning due to the hardships of war. Its buildings were requisitioned by the War Ministry and most of the faculty were not in town. However, a few professors, including Philippide as well as Ibrăileanu and Dimitrie Gusti, were able to teach part of their course schedule inside their private homes, which were not entirely taken over by the army. In October 1918, after Romania made peace with Germany, Philippide proposed Stere, Ibrăileanu, and Ilie Bărbulescu for membership of the Academy—they lost, owing to Stere's uncompromising Germanophilia.

Up to this point only three complete Middle English romances had appeared in scholarly editions: "Golagrus and Gawain" and "The Awntyrs of Arthure" had been published by John Pinkerton, and "Launfal" by George Ellis. Thomas Percy's "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry", arguably the ultimate source of inspiration for Ritson’s collection, did not include any mediaeval romance in full, and only the synopsis of "Lybeaus Disconus". Ritson approached the task with his usual insistence on the highest standards of editorial fidelity to the original text. "Every article", he wrote, "is derive'd from some ancient manuscript, or old printed copy, of the authenticity of which the reader has all possible satisfaction; and is printed with an accuracy, and adherence to the original, of which the publick has had very few examples". All manuscripts were transcribed by himself, with the exception of "Sir Orpheo" and "The Erle of Toulous", copies of which were provided by Walter Scott and John Baynes respectively. Apart from being a literary scholar Ritson was also a spelling-reformer, and in all the editorial matter of the "Romanceës" he adopted his own system of "etymological" spelling, a fact which was to deter readers and be seized on by hostile reviewers.
