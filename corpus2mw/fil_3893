Soul Destruction is the second studio album (third overall) released by Scottish heavy metal band The Almighty. It was released by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom in 1991. According to front-man Ricky Warwick, the album's songs centered around four subjects:
On May 31, 1933 with the rise of the UANL the Escuela de Bachilleres was established in the Colegio Civil. At that time the Colegio Civil was also used by a law school. Later in 1939, the Nocturn School for Workers (now Preparatoria 3) was founded.
In mathematics, the rational points on the unit circle are those points ("x", "y") such that both "x" and "y" are rational numbers ("fractions") and satisfy "x"2 + "y"2 = 1. The set of such points turns out to be closely related to primitive Pythagorean triples. Consider a primitive right triangle, that is, with integral side lengths "a", "b", "c", with "c" the hypotenuse, such that the sides have no common factor larger than 1. Then on the unit circle there exists the rational point ("a"/"c", "b"/"c"), which, in the complex plane, is just "a"/"c" + "ib"/"c", where "i" is the imaginary unit. Conversely, if ("x", "y") is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system (i.e. "x" > 0, "y" > 0), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides "xc", "yc", "c", with "c" being the least common multiple of "x" and "y" denominators. There is a correspondence between points ("x","y") in the "x"-"y" plane and points "x" + "iy" in the complex plane which will be used below, with ("a", "b") taken as equal to "a" + "ib".
