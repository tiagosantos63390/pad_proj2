The Varsity bowling team traveled to the state championships in 2007 and 2008, finishing in 5th place both years. The 2007-2008 final overall record for the Mohawks was 21-1. The Mohawks were also GGCL Champs and took 3rd place in the Holiday Classic held at Western Bowl on December 15, 2007.

This game was listed by CBS Sportsline.com as number six on the list of games to watch during the 2007 season. "The annual Red River Shootout in Dallas will once again feature two top-ten teams with the winner being the front-runner for not only a Big 12 title but a factor in the national title picture. The game will also feature one of the best match-ups of the year with Limas Sweed and Billy Pittman of the Longhorns facing against Oklahoma’s excellent secondary." However, the matchup was hurt when both teams suffered unexpected losses the week before. The last time both teams entered the game after a loss was 1999. The morning of the Red River Rivalry, oddsmakers favored Oklahoma to win by 12–13 points.
