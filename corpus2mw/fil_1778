GAG (Gestor de Arranque Gráfico, English: "Graphical Boot Manager") is a GNU GPL boot loader for x86 computers. GAG does not need its own partition — it installs directly to the boot sector of Hard disk or floppy disk which allows it to survive to repartitioning or formatting. It is distributed as a bootable disk image, which makes it fully operating system-independent. It can be installed from a CD-ROM or from a linux terminal too (this last method allows to install it in a USB pendrive).

As part of the "Marvel NOW!" event in the pages of "Savage Wolverine", Amadeus Cho appeared on an island in the Savage Land where he stops the fight between Wolverine and a tribe of Neanderthals after one of them had killed Shanna the She-Devil. He convinces them that he is their god and to help save Shanna's life. Using the lifeblood of a Man-Thing that was native to the Savage Land, the Neanderthal tribe resurrected Shanna. Amadeus Cho told Shanna what the Neanderthal natives had explained to him. The machine powering the damping field was also powering a prison, one holding an ancient hostile alien presence. Realizing that Wolverine would be releasing this creature, Shanna raced to stop him. She arrived in time with Amadeus Cho right behind her and was able to stop Wolverine. Suddenly, Hulk appeared before them.
