He made two appearances for Croatia at the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals and also featured in all of their three group matches at the UEFA Euro 2004 finals. Both these tournaments saw Croatia being eliminated in the group stage, just like the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, where he appeared in all of Croatia's three matches. Winning his 82nd international cap in the team's second match at the latter tournament, against Japan on 18 June 2006 in Nuremberg, he dislodged Robert Jarni (81 caps) as the Croatian national team's all-time cap leader. In the final group match, a 2–2 draw against Australia, he was sent off five minutes from time after receiving his second yellow card.

In comparing Polk’s works to Joshua Johnson, they have very similar style in positioning objects and creating composition. The awkwardness of the works is actually somewhat appealing for both artists and probably deliberate. Both artists often have subjects holding objects in a way that while unnatural also brings interests and causes the hands to be shaped in a visually interesting way. The art work of both avoids expressiveness and instead chooses to emphasize capturing some likeness of the subject.

Kwik Save is a discount supermarket chain, originally Welsh, with stores across the United Kingdom. It went into administration in 2007, but was brought back in April 2012. Its stores were small to medium sized high street supermarkets, mainly located in areas with below average incomes. It struggled to make profits in the 21st century as superstore operators such as Tesco and Sainsbury's introduced their own budget brands, and other discounters such as Lidl and Aldi (who both arrived in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 1990s) expanded. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but it went into administration on 6 July 2007 and closed most of its stores across the United Kingdom, with the remaining 56 being sold to a new company, FreshXpress, which itself went into administration in March 2008. It was then resurrected in a smaller form with nine stores, but this second incarnation of FreshXpress went into administration and ceased trading in 2009. All remaining stores have since been closed.

In 1922, Takao Ozawa filed for United States citizenship under the Naturalization Act of 1906 which allowed white persons and persons of African descent or African nativity to naturalize. He did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he attempted to have Japanese people classified as white.

Pitchfork Media and Allmusic journalist Mark Richardson defined it thus: "The vanishing-point music created by drone elders Phill Niblock and, especially, LaMonte Young is what happens when a fixation on held tones reaches a tipping point. Timbre is reduced to either a single clear instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level interaction between small clusters of "pure" tone becomes the music's content. This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish "music" from "sound," discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again from scratch."
According to local folklore, Barotac Nuevo was famous for its well-bred horses. There was once a horse called Tamasak, a pure white stallion known for its strength, in the stead of one Don Simon, and who was offered much if he could sell it to Manuel Gonzales de Aguilar, the Governor General of the country at that time. Don Simon eventually sold Tamasak. But not for money, but for title, and separation from the town of Dumangas, which it was just a smaller section thereof. The barrio once known as "Mulatac" now stands the town of Barotac Nuevo.

Snedden succeeded McMahon as leader, but Wentworth was among his most persistent party-room critics. In March 1975 it was Wentworth who moved the motion in the Liberal Party room to depose Snedden from the leadership in favour of Malcolm Fraser. But under Fraser's government he soon found himself back in his old role of the backbench rebel. His lifelong commitment to Keynesianism led him to criticise Fraser's cuts to government spending as deflationary. Having already announced his intention of retiring from Parliament at the next election, he resigned from the Liberal Party in October 1977. He stood for the Senate in New South Wales at the December 1977 election, polling 2.1 per cent of the vote. Later he was active in the Grey Power movement, and stood again for the Senate as a Grey Power candidate at the 1984 election; again, he did badly.
