During this whole time, Alice Boner never stopped painting, and her studies on these methods of ancient compositions led Boner to paint a triptych inspired by her findings in the Silpa Prakasa. The subjects of her triptych are Prakṛti, Vishvarupa, and Kālī. She worked on these large paintings for several years, but was never quite satisfied with them. Today the triptych is on display in the Bharat Kala Bhavan at the Museum of the Banaras Hindu University.
