In 2004 the sports talk show "The Upper Deck" was created by Tony Bolton and Mike Morland. In the fall of 2005, Kevin Liddy replaced co-host Tony Bolton (who left for WCBN in Ann Arbor). Over four and a half years, "The Upper Deck" became the longest running show in station history (2004–2008) and the highest rated show in 2007 and 2008. During that time, the show was unofficially covered by the website letsgowings.com due to its in-depth hockey coverage. Notable interviews included Matt Schwartz of Letsgowings.com and Helene St.James of the "Detroit Free Press".

In order to underline his non-involvement in the feud, he asked family members to send a letter to the Gazzetta del Sud newspaper. The message was clear: the feud was a clash between minor elements of the clan and Gambazza was trying to reach a peace without victors, as he had done in the past, in 1991, when the conflict started.
