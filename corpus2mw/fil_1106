As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal fire; and the apostle says, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." Corinthians 6:9–10 And as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us—lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing. . . . And again does the apostle say, "Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers with them." 5:6–7 ("Against Heresies", Book 4:27.4)
Finucane was posted to No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch on 13 July 1940, just as the Battle of Britain was getting underway. No. 65 Squadron boasted several aces, including Bill Franklin who had destroyed 10 enemy aircraft. Finucane noted he was the scruffiest man in the squadron, but was envious of him and keen to emulate him. Anxious to get more experience, Finucane loitered around dispersal hoping to build up flight time on the Spitfire. He made a few flights to improve his handling of the fighter. Finucane was assigned to B Flight or "Green Section", under the command of Franklin. On 24 July, the squadron moved to a satellite airfield at Rochford. The following day, he became operational.
