Nowrasteh also did in-depth academic research on the relation between immigration and the welfare state in the United States. A paper by him on the subject in collaboration with George Mason University doctoral student Zachary Gochenour was published as a Cato working paper in January 2014. The paper claimed to find that immigration to the United States appeared to have not had a significant impact on the welfare state viewed in either per capita or aggregate terms. The authors summarized their findings and the policy implications in an op-ed for "Investors Business Daily". Bryan Caplan blogged about the paper on EconLog, and Ilya Somin discussed the policy implications of the research in an article for the "Washington Post".

Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on.
