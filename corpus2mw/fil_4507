Healthcare and social security in Belgium is a federal matter, but the special laws of Belgium grants the three communities several competences, such as "assistance to persons".

Bibliography.
Early film, being a cutting-edge medium, also provided opportunity for bisexuality to be expressed. In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in "A Florida Enchantment", by Sidney Drew. However, due to the censorship legally required by the Hays Code, the word bisexual could not be mentioned and almost no bisexual characters appeared, in American film from 1934 until 1968.
