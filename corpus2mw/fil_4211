Fresh cut tree farms are generally large farms that grow trees that are cut in large numbers and sold to wholesalers who sell them to local stores and Christmas tree lots. The extended period of time that elapses from the time of cutting the tree until the retail customer takes the tree home limits the number of species of trees that can be used as fresh cut trees. These trees must be able to retain their color and their needles for long periods of time after they are cut. The most common species that are grown as fresh cut trees are Frasier fir, Scotch pine, Douglas fir, and Balsam fir. Since fir trees generally require cooler climates, nurseries that primarily propagate trees for fresh cut tree farms are typically located in the northern United States.
