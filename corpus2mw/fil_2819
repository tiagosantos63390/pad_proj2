Richardson began his career with his hometown team the Swindon Lynx. In 2003, Richardson moved to the Bracknell Bees in a two year spell. Richardson's good performances during the 2004â€“05 season, which included 9 goals and 18 assists for 27 points, saw him move to the Elite League for the Cardiff Devils. His first season of 10 points in 30 games was impressive for an Elite League rookie, but his second season saw him collect 33 points, including 24 assists in 54 games. Richardson moved to the Nottingham Panthers in 2007, in what was a slightly disappointing season for him, but still managed to collect 20 points in 46 games. In 2008, Richardson signed with the Basingstoke Bison. Shortly after the end of the 08/09 season, with Basingstoke dropping out of the Elite League, Richardson re-signed for the Cardiff Devils as a defenceman.
