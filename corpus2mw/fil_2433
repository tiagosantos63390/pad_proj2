The Rubber Soul Project (RSP for short) was a Serbian band. They recorded a single album, called "The Rubber Soul Project", in 1996. The band took their name from the famous Beatles record "Rubber Soul" released in 1965. The band recorded an imaginary Beatles album, by writing music and lyrics to songs for which they had heard only the titles. Some of the tracks were available on bootlegs which, at the time, were not to be found in Serbia, so the members, having read about the songs, decided to record their own songs inspired by the titles.
