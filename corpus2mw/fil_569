The Carabiniers maintain a musical band consisting of twenty-six "rifle-musicians" under the command of a "Maréchal des Logis Chef". In 1978, the title of ""Fanfare de la Companies des Carabiniers"" was adopted. An integral part of the unit, the band is not trained solely to perform music. Instead, Carabiners receive the same training as their fellow comrades. The band participates in the same occasions, and duties as the Company. The diversity of the repertoire of the band allows it to perform at official ceremonies, sporting events, and public concerts. Since 1989, the band has performed outside of Monaco, in multitudes of destinations, such as: Saumur, Nîmes, Albertville, Lugano, Düsseldorf, Turin, Lisbon, Seville, Geneva, and Hanover.

Boating accident.
Glamorgan Dragons recorded a victory at their home ground Sophia Gardens, despite being tied down in mid-match by Sean Ervine and Shaun Udal who took two wickets each and both conceded less than 40 runs. Wicket-keeper Mark Wallace hit one six and one four in a valuable hit-out late on, while Michael Powell had set the pace with 52. Then, Hampshire Hawks were shot down in the chase. David Harrison had John Crawley caught with the second ball of the match, and Andrew Davies followed up, getting Greg Lamb and Ervine caught behind. With James Adams bowled by Harrison, Hampshire had scored seven runs for four wickets, and their lower order never recovered. Jono McLean was the first to hit into double figures, before he too was caught behind off Davies, and Harrison then took two as Hampshire were 33 for 7. Kevin Latouf and Shaun Udal adjusted somewhat, adding 19 for the eighth wicket, but first change bowler Alex Wharf cleaned up them as well, leaving Hampshire all out for 69 – the lowest score of the National League Division One all season, and giving Glamorgan the highest victory by runs in the division all season.

The former scheme, in which the hosts agree on the high-level protocol for a given circuit, is referred to in RFC 2684 as "VC Multiplexing". It has the advantage of not requiring additional information in a packet, which minimises the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit, customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost.
