Nordic Game Jam is an annual game jam that takes place in Copenhagen, created in 2006 by Gorm Lai (the Danish chapter of the International Game Developers Association) in collaboration with Jesper Juul (the IT University of Copenhagen) and Henriette Moos (Diginet Øresund). It is the biggest videogame-related event in Denmark and one of the largest game jams in the world, with 500 participants as of 2014. Participants are given a theme or series of restrictions at the beginning of the event and are then given around 38 hours to make a game around those. In 2009 it served as the flagship game jam and inspiration for Global Game Jam. The 2013 edition of Nordic Game Jam was for the first time held at Aalborg University – Copenhagen. The latest Nordic Game Jam was held from February 14-16, 2014.
