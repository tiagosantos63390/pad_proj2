Intuitively, the identity cannot be proved because the high school axioms can't be used to discuss the polynomial formula_3. Reasoning about that polynomial and the subterm formula_4 requires a concept of negation or subtraction, and these are not present in the high school axioms. Lacking this, it is then impossible to use the axioms to manipulate the polynomial and prove true properties about it. Wilkie's results from his paper show, in more formal language, that the "only gap" in the high school axioms is the inability to manipulate polynomials with negative coefficients.
