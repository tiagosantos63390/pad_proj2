While on patrol just south of the DMZ in the early morning hours of 16 June 1968 reported seeing two rockets fired from an unidentified source hit the Navy swift boat, "PCF-19" which sank very quickly with the loss of five of the crew. Shortly thereafter, "Point Dume" came under fire from an unidentified aircraft along with the heavy cruiser and the Australian destroyer . The duration of the attack was about one hour with little damage to the cutter and "Boston" but considerable damage to "Hobart" and injury to several of her crew. Evidence showed later during a board of inquiry that it was a friendly fire incident involving Air Force and Navy aircraft mistaking the ships for enemy targets. This incident and the 11 August 1966 friendly fire incident involving "Point Welcome" caused several procedures for the identification of naval vessels by Navy, Marine and Air Force aircrews to change.
