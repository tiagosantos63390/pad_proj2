in 1958, as a white Southerner during the early years of the civil rights struggle, Louis Harlan published his first book, "Separate and Unequal: Public School Campaigns and Racism in the Southern Seaport States, 1901–1915". Following stints as an associate professor at East Texas State Teachers College and University of Cincinnati, he became, in 1965, professor of history at the University of Maryland, within easy access to the collection of documents left by Booker T. Washington. Over the next two decades, he continued to work on Washington's biography, while also editing, with another Washington historian, Raymond W. Smock, an edition of Washington's papers, which were published over a fourteen-year period, between 1972 and 1988, ultimately reaching fourteen volumes.

The 21st crossed the Rappahannock on December 12 via the pontoon bridges that had been constructed by the Union army and spent the night along the west bank of the river. On the morning of the 13th, the regiment was ordered to the west part of the city, near the base of the heights. Here they removed the grey overcoats that had been issued to them for fear of being mistaken for Confederates. From this position, the 21st watched an assault by a portion of the II Corps over the open plain leading to heights and were shocked by the carnage that resulted from the failed attack. Just after this assault, Ferrero's brigade was ordered to attack the heights and the 21st formed a line of battle on the open ground slightly after noon. The 21st advanced, according to Walcott, "under the best directed artillery fire we had ever suffered or seen." Color bearers were repeatedly shot down. One, Sgt. Thomas Plunkett, was hit by an artillery shell that took off his right arm and left hand. Despite his wounds, he managed to keep the colors from falling. The flag is today in the collection at the Massachusetts State House and still bears the stains from Plunkett's wounds. Plunkett was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery at Fredericksburg.
On 7 August 2012, Cullen returned to Bury for a further loan period, playing in 12 games and scoring once. His loan spell was brought to an end on 18 October 2012 following a shin injury.

On 12 March 2013 Cullen scored two goals in a 2–0 win against Barrow.
In contrast with this plural use of the word, in a 1954 article written by Arnold Field, a reporter for the "Daily Dispatch", Gardner had apparently explained to him that "there are man and woman witches. Each is called a wica." This quote offers the only piece of evidence that Gardner also referred to Pagan Witches individually as a "wica". It is possible that Field misunderstood what Gardner was saying by not capitalising "Wica", and that therefore Gardner might have never used "Wica" in a singular sense.
It is not to be confused with the election to the North Carolina House of Representatives, which was held on the same day.

After two years of study at the university, Wang reached a pinnacle of his college career by delivering his third scientific paper, which described how the language that is composed and delivered by a brain, acts in turn to stimulate, promote, optimize and advance the brain, when this “interaction” is viewed from the perspective of the evolution of human intelligence. Antecedents to the thoughts reflected in the third paper can be found in the second paper and even in his first paper seven years before. The paper was reviewed by Wu Xizai (吴熙载), a distinguished professor in the field. Wu made a strong recommendation to the president of the university, Liu Daoyu (刘道玉), and asked the president as a favor, to allow Wang to change his major. Twenty days after Wang submitted his paper, which was on January 11, 1980, Wang became the first student in the nation and in the history of the modern Chinese higher education, to be allowed by Chinese Ministry of Education to switch from a major in social sciences – history, to be a major in natural sciences - biology. Wang's paper was a significant incident in the history of Chinese education and also changed his goals in life.

Mark Ratner (Ben Savage), born on April 24, 1980 in San Diego, CA, is a kind and nerdy engineer who "just loves math." He attended James Buchanan High School in San Diego in the same graduating class as his eventual wife Heather Chandler and Sarah Walker (then using the alias Jenny Burton). He had participated with Sarah in several high school activities-AV Club, Chess Team, and Mathletics. However, when he designs a new super-bomber, his wife, Heather, associates with the Russian mob to kill him and steal the blueprints. Ratner believes that Chuck is actually the fictional Charles Carmichael, a dangerous and bad-ass agent, after being saved multiple times by Casey but giving credit to Chuck. In keeping with the series' tendency to reference popular culture, he shares his name with the nerdy Mark Ratner (Brian Backer) in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", while the trio's alma mater shares its name with the Sweathogs' high school in "Welcome Back, Kotter", both of which are more directly referenced in the subsequent episode, "Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer". "First seen in: Chuck Versus the Cougars."
