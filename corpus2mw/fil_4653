On 11 September 2012 Tulisa revealed that her new single would be a "Christmassy ballad" that would "stand the test of time", without revealing the track's title. Shortly after the announcement, she visited the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, where she performed album track and fellow ballad, "Skeletons". Thus, it was assumed that Skeletons was to be the single that Tulisa was describing. However, on 8 October 2012, press images captured on the set of her new music video confirmed the title of the single to be "Sight of You" and not "Skeletons". This was confirmed by Tulisa herself when she invited the contestants from her category on "The X Factor" to join her at the video shoot, and behind the scenes footage of the shoot was featured on the show. Shortly after, on 21 October 2012, the full official music video premiered via Tulisa's official VEVO account on YouTube. The video features Tulisa standing on a bridge with a city view, performing the song whilst traffic flows beneath her. Other scenes portray a heatbreaking relationship between Tulisa and her boyfriend, played by her short-term real life boyfriend Jody Latham. The single was then confirmed for release on 25 November 2012, a day before the album's release.

An important movement of Czech art in the 20th century was Cubism, the most creative period being 1910–19. Whilst there were visual artists who worked in the style, Czech Cubism is often mostly associated with architecture, so much so that the art historian Miroslav Lamac commented "Prague became the city of cubism". Bohumil Kubišta is an important artist associated with the movement and his work displays many French influences such as the brushwork of Cézanne as well as the obvious influence of Picasso. František Kupka is probably the most internationally recognised Czech artist from the period and his work continued to evolve past Cubism, eventually establishing himself as an early pioneer of abstract art.
