Blair was greatly interested in ciphers and stenography, and wrote articles about the subject in "Rees's Cyclopædia". David Kahn, in his work "The Code breakers" (1967), characterized Blair's "superb article" as "the finest treatise in English on cryptology" until Parker Hitt's military manual was published by the U.S. Army in 1916. Blair's article on ciphers from the American edition of the "Cyclopedia" has been digitized and can be linked from the website about the Beale ciphers.
In 1833, Louis-Philippe proposed the establishment of a museum dedicated to “all the glories of France,” which included the Orléans dynasty and the Revolution of 1830 that put Louis-Philippe on the throne of France. For the next decade, under the direction of Eugène-Charles-Frédéric Nepveu and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, the château underwent irreversible alterations (Constans, 1985; 1987; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet, 1985). The museum was officially inaugurated on 10 June 1837 as part of the festivities that surrounded the marriage of the Prince royal, Ferdinand-Philippe d’Orléans with princess Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and represented one of the most ambitious and costly undertakings of Louis-Philippe’s reign.

Isaac and Carver can now roll and take cover to avoid attacks. This new ability was described by a Visceral Games developer as essential, as it "felt dumb/terrible not to have it" and that they have been "making Isaac more responsive", as they "want the horror to come from the terrible things that happen in the game; not from the horror that something is moving slowly towards you and you can't shoot it because the game controls like a piece of crap." The cover system is also described as "organic" in nature; for example, the player does not need to "walk up to certain tagged things and press the cover button; Clarke or Carver just does the action that is appropriate for the given situation."
The Griffins call the FBI to hopefully get Meg back, but the FBI said that a person must be missing for 96 hours before they could take action. Concerned by it, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves to take matters into their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave to get in, and Stewie is sold to Brian. However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab king waiting in the master stateroom. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a "goddess" and asks her to marry him, to which Meg eagerly agrees. Stewie then kills the prince, uses a neuralizer on Meg, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely.
