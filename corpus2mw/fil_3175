Since 1976 Jeffrey Isaac has been showing his paintings in numerous exhibitions in the U.S., Switzerland, Italy and Germany. In New York he started publishing the so-called “world’s smallest magazine of its kind” named “Public Illumination Magazine.” In 1986 he moved to Umbria near the town of Spoleto. There he met the American artist Sol LeWitt who became a good friend. During the period from 1999 to 2006, he devoted more of his time to video. In 2004, a minor scandal surrounded a banner he had painted at the invitation of the town Foligno for the annual central procession that showed the patron saint Feliciano riding virtually naked on a horse. In 2007 he designed the animation for the performance of IL CORVO by the LaMama Experimental Theater Company at the 38th Biennale Teatro in Venice. In 2009, a selection of paintings from this period was shown at the exhibition DETOURNEMENT VENISE 2009 a collateral event of the 53rd Venice Biennale.

Later in 2006, Liu "et al." published their own study of the age of the Daohugou beds, this time using Zircon Uranium-lead dating on the volcanic rocks overlying and underlying salamander-bearing layers (salamanders are often used as index fossils). Liu "et al." found that the beds formed between 164-158 million years ago, in the Middle to Late Jurassic. A 2012 study by Gao and Shubin agreed with this assessment, and reported an Argon–argon date of 164 plus or minus 4 million years ago for the Daohugou horizon.

The name "irregularity" comes from the fact that for the first surfaces investigated in detail, the smooth complex surfaces in P3, the irregularity happens to vanish. The irregularity then appeared as a new "correction" term measuring the difference "p""g" − "p""a" of the geometric genus and the arithmetic genus of more complicated surfaces. Surfaces are sometimes called regular or irregular depending on whether or not the irregularity vanishes.

The theme known as "radical drag" was a central element to the Festival of Light and subsequent GLF actions. In response to ideas about the 'wrong-sex', gay people distanced themselves from stereotypes of effeminate gay men and butch lesbians, in a way in which gay people were supposed to appear like anybody else. Within the Gay Liberation Movement there was also a deeper questioning of the validity of gender roles. The philosophy underlying radical drag rejected the concepts of masculinity and femininity, which correlated to ideas of dominance and submission. The idea of men who are really women, or of 'real men' dissolves in this deconstruction. In dissociating from the stigma of effeminacy in order to gain acceptance in heterosexual society, gay men tacitly supported the rigidity of gender roles, a definition of men from which they were excluded because of their sexuality. Gay men were complicit in the oppression of the effeminate gay men who adopted that stereotype, often denouncing the camp queens and diesel dykes who had 'come out' and born the brunt of homopbobia before those who were more discreet themselves felt comfortable enough to come out. In 1974, to counteract this, the GLF stated that it had developed "a strong section of opinion which claims that the only way for gay people to come out that will make any real impact on the gender role definitions which underlie gay oppression is by adopting a life-style and appearance that explicitly reject the masculine/feminine distinction and all that it implies."
