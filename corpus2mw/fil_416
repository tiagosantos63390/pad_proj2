The origins of the 9th Parachutist Assault Regiment can be found in the World War I. Among its precursors is the IX Reparto d'Assalto ("9th Assault Section"), known as the Arditi ('Brave or Bold / Tough Ones' - but the verb "ardire" or "to dare" suggests "The Daring" as a more proper translation), who were often tasked with preempting infantry assaults on the Italo-Austrian front lines (which is currently the border between Italy and Slovenia). It was during this period that the 9th earned its reputation as a fierce fighting force. 'Going over the top', followed by the launch of hand-grenades deep into enemy territory, was commonplace. The 9th was responsible for the capture of numerous Austrian positions on "Monte Grappa", including "Col Moschin", and the "Col della Beretta".

In 2013 the town was menaced by a bushfire burning on the north eastern side of town. The fire burnt out of control with strong winds starting spot fires among the banana plantations. The blaze was controlled a day later but destroyed of bushland, including 20 derelict buildings and sheds; the plantations only received minor damage.
