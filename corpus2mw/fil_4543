The books were published and printed by John Marshall, one of the most prominent chapbook printers in Newcastle during the early nineteenth century. The books are undated and it is difficult to give an accurate date, but the fact that John Marshall did not move into the Flesh Market premises until 1811, dates them not before that date. Several of the later books can be dated approximately from the events, or dates within the titles. The first volumes appeared around the same time as John Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards, published in 1812. The six volume set of books contain some of the region's traditional songs and generally seem to stick to the same formulae as many other Chapbooks in using the same, or similar, well known songs. There are however a few "different" unusual and rare songs which do not appear in many other similar publications. It is assumed that these books, due to the content, would have been very popular with local population.
The Federation of German-American Clubs (Verband Deutsch-Amerikanischer Clubs e.V., VDAC) was founded in 1948 and currently consists of 31 local clubs from all over Germany.
