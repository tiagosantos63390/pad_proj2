At the end of the 8th century, the Franks under Charlemagne overthrew the Avar Empire and invaded the Pannonian plains. The Christian Romanized populace living around Keszthely quickly adopted the customs of western Christendom, which meant among other things that they buried their dead without grave goods so now it is impossible to identify them. The Fenékpuszta fortress was repaired again in the 9th century. Its walls accommodated and gave shelter to the descendants of the Avars and the southern Slavic people who had migrated in at the beginning of the century. Their cemeteries maintained many of the pagan customs.

In the mid-1980s, Rockley took the initiative to revive the Toronto chapter of the Society for Technical Communication, a professional organization for technical communicators, by getting in touch with the international organization's representative for her area, Rennie Charles. The chapter was founded in 1959 but had been dormant for several years. She and Michelle Hutchinson, another technical communicator, assembled a group of their colleagues and presented a plan to hold regular meetings, find speakers of interest, and develop services for technical communicators. The chapter has been active ever since. Among other things, Rockley served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and was general manager for a very successful three-day, multi-stream conference in 1989. (Hutchinson served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and organized the hosting of the international society's annual conference in 1997.)

In 1923, Tigerstedt moved to America where he founded his last company, the Tiger Manufacturing Co., to produce small radio receivers and cryptographic devices. The Mexican government purchased two of the cryptographic devices, and the radio receivers also sold relatively well. Tigerstedt had the opportunity to meet with the great American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, who wrote a letter of recommendation for Tigerstedt to the director of the Department of Commerce.
"The Rocket" began publication in 1934. Student participation as newspaper staff increased in the 1970s following the Watergate controversy, along with enrollment in journalism classes. The paper has been no stranger to controversy. In 1970 its front page showed a simulated wanted poster accusing U.S. President Richard Nixon of "homicide, genocide, and conspiracy." The alumni association and the faculty council denounced the issue, but the college said the paper is a publication by the students and has its own editorial policy. The paper again found itself in the news when its editorial cartoon in 2006 dealt with reverse racism.
