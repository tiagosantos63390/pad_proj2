Kyle Rodney Kendrick (born August 26, 1984) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was born in Houston, Texas, but attended high school in Mount Vernon, Washington. While growing up, he was greatly influenced by his father, from whom he developed his composure when pitching. Upon graduation, he turned down a scholarship to play college football, instead signing a contract to begin his professional baseball career in the Phillies organization. After a slow ascent through the lower levels of the Phillies' minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2007, and was a member of the starting rotation of the 2008 World Series Champion team.
