Plot.
The modern day fanfare bands began in the 19th century in Germany and in France. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Band of the Republican Guard began developing its own fanfare and bugle section under its director Gabriel Defrance, thus the band and bugles of the service are the predecessors of today's ensembles. French civil fanfare bands would begin in that similar style and fashion in the early 20th century and so too are their governing bodies. The modern day ensemble would be born in 1935 as the Band and Bugles of the French Air Force under Claude Laty, the then director of music, who created the modern day fanfare band and its standard instrumentation as the band created its own fanfare and bugle section with then drum major Maurice Bonnard. The oldest and still playing Fanfare Band / Orchestra in the world was founded in Belgium in 1806 at Izegem and is currently known under Koninklijke Stadsfanfaren Izegem (www.kfsi.be). In Germany their use was reduced to civilian bands from the late 18th century onward although the fanfare trumpets stayed in military bands till today. These civil bands form the basis of today's ensembles. In the late 20th century even the use of the shoulder strap and the introduction of valved bugles and multiple tenor drums from the US revolutionized the ensembles and the instruments they use. Today several ensembles use brass instruments in addition to the standard instrumentation as well as the multiple tenor drum.
