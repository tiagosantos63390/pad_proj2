where formula_5 is a constant. This implicitly assumes that "V"TBG remains roughly constant during the maneuver. A somewhat more clever strategy can be designed that takes into account the rate of time change of "V"TBG as well, since this is available from the differential equation above.

The court distinguished this case law by stating that the tax in this case did not involve physical property because the casinos were not land based, but rather riverboat casinos. Thus, the money exacted through the tax was not intertwined to real property and nothing physical was taking within the meaning of the federal Constitution. Therefore, a takings analysis would not apply.
