It was first published in 1793 by James Edward Smith, in his "A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland". 
Panofka studied classical philology at Berlin University from 1819. In 1823 he travelled to Rome and a year later - along with the painter Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (1787-1837), the art writer and collector August Kestner and the classical art historian Eduard Gerhard - founded the "Hyperboreans" (Hyperboreisch-r√∂mische Gesellschaft), a group of northern European scholars who studied classical ruins in Rome. In Rome, Panofka's intelligence drew attention and patronage from the Duc de Blacas (1770-1839), the French ambassador to the Papal States, and a collector of antiquities, with whom Panofka remained upon the duke's 1828 return to Paris. When in 1829 the "Hyperboreans" metamorphosed into the Instituto di Corrispondenza Archaeologica, Panofka was named the new organisation's secretary for its members in Paris.
