Surprised by Aberhart's refusal to be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to reassess their strategy. They got that time when, on March 17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March 24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.

These points are found primarily in the middle Hudson Valley of New York State, but are found as far east as Massachusetts.
This structure can then serve as an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC), because of its high surface impedance within a certain frequency range. In addition, as an artificial magnetic conductor it has a forbidden frequency band, over which surface waves and currents cannot propagate. Therefore, AMC surfaces have good radiation patterns without unwanted ripples based on suppressing the surface wave propagation within the band gap frequency range.

More recently, Robinson was part of a team that has discovered a plausible cause of colony collapse disorder, a malady that in 2007-2008 killed off more than one third of commercial honey bees in the U.S. By analyzing differences in gene expression between healthy and infected honey bees, researchers learned that bees in CCD hives have unusually high levels of fragmented ribosomal RNA, a symptom of infection with multiple viruses.
Weddington stated that Republicans were "trying to put some of us all in the back of the bus" by allowing the passage of a bill that requires photo ID to cast a ballot. He believed the bill disenfranchised African American voters.

On April 4, 2001, the European Council approved the protocol on heavy metals in order to reduce emissions of heavy metals that are subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport and are likely to have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The 2001 EU Large Combustion Plant Directive considers stationary combustion plants as one of the main sources of emission of NOx, SOx, particulates and heavy metals into the atmosphere. With the application of the European Directives 96/61/CE (Integrated pollution prevention and control) and 96/62/CE (Ambient air quality assessment and management) in which emission limits for toxic trace elements, such as mercury, are clearly established, energy production plants using coal must control mercury emissions. In January 2005, the European Commission adopted a mercury strategy for reducing mercury levels in the environment.
Lia is an AB Communication graduate of Ateneo de Manila University. She began her career, even before her cable channel gigs, as she clinched a courtside student-reporting stint in the 2005 and 2006 for Ateneo at the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) collegiate basketball league on Studio 23. Lia's former TV projects include House of Hoops (ABC 5), Man and Machine (MTV, Studio 23) Auto Extreme (Solar Sports), U-Rock (radio show on NU107), and DJ on Heart 103.5.

"Jouvea's" closest relative in the Chloridoideae subfamily is likely Monanthochloe; both share the characteristic of distichously arranged leaves, and within species both have their staminate and pistillate flowers on separate plants.
