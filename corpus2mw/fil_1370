The music video goes between shots of the band playing in front of a tree and a preteen boy who is sleeping in what we are to believe is a camp. During the night the boy wakes up fully dressed, and equipped with a flashlight sneaks out of his bunk. At the same time, a girl (Played by Chloe Greenfield) in another bunk also awakes and steals off into the night. Running out of the camp he descends a flight of stairs while his female companion sneaks out of her cabin. Numerous official looking guards enter both former cabins doing a bed check, and upon finding the empty beds, the lead guard in the female cabin blows a whistle waking up the entire camp, suggesting that this is something other than an ordinary summer camp. All the lights are turned on throughout the camp including large spotlights on towers illuminating the scene while the guards spread out with flashlights. Both continue to run through the woods separated from each other while the guards follow until they reach a large chain link and barbed wire fence. Upon reaching the fence and realizing their situation, they kiss while lights from the other side of the fence illuminate the scene. Escaping through a gap they come upon the band playing to a small crowd. As the guards continue to search now accompanied by German Shepherds both the boy and girl easily blend in with the rest of the crowd. As the band continues to play they crowd surf and when the guards arrive they find a closed gate with no trace of either the children or the band.
