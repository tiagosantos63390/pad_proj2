A series of biochemical switches control transitions between and within the various phases of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is a series of complex, ordered, sequential events that control how a single cell divides into two cells, and involves several different phases. The phases include the G1 and G2 phases, DNA replication or S phase, and the actual process of cell division, mitosis or M phase. During the M phase, the chromosomes separate and cytokinesis occurs.

Since 2011 KAIROS has increased its focus on Indigenous Rights in Canada, starting with its 2011-12 Campaign on 'Truth, Reconciliation & Equity': working towards the realization of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in Canada. It has been actively promoting and educating on the 'Free, Prior and Informed Consent' (FPIC) provision of the UNDRIP (with specific focus on Resource Extraction issues), strongly supported the 'Idle No More' movement in Canada, and explicitly engaged in the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada to witness and support those impacted by the Residential School system.
The silver maravedí money of account represented (according to one interpretation) about 22 g of silver in 1258. This had fallen to 11 g by 1271, to 3 g by 1286, and to 1.91 g in 1303. The gold maravedí had disappeared as a money of account by 1300. The "maravedí de plata" (silver maravedí) gradually came to be used as money of account for larger sums, for the value of gold coins, and for the mint price of silver, and eventually it supplanted the sueldo as the main accounting unit. Alfonso XI (1312–1350) did not call any of his coins a maravedí, and henceforth the term was used only as a unit of account and not as the name of a coin.
Schinia purpurascens
The name appears to have been quite rare in Latin, although the reason for this is unclear. Perhaps nine was simply the least auspicious number between five and ten (Septimus and Octavius were also quite rare in Latin). However, it is also possible that the Oscan praenomen "Novius" was derived from the same root. If this is the case, then Roman families may have preferred that form to Nonus on the rare instances in which it was called for.

Ophionyssus natricis or Reptile mite is a parasitic mite most commonly found on snakes, but also occurring on captive lizards, turtles, crocodiles and other reptiles. The parasites feed on snakes, which cause the bodies of the mites to be engorged with blood and fluids from the snake. Once the mites feed by puncturing through the snake skin, the snake usually shows symptoms of irritation and discomfort. Also this provides a point of entry where diseases from "Aeromonas spp." and Inclusion Body Disease (IBD) can be transmitted. Mites have also been shown to act as vectors for IBD. The pathology for disease transmission by the mites is still unknown. Human infestation has been reported.

In 1876 Grose opened a restaurant and hotel on Yesler Way called "Our House", which was popular with Seattle's largely white population, and later added a barbershop. Restaurants and barber shops were two of the only occupations open to blacks in pioneer Seattle, which, though it did not have the explicitly racist laws of neighboring states like Oregon and Idaho, offered black opportunity only in limited, usually menial positions. The important lumbering, mining, and shipping industries of early Seattle and environs were closed to blacks. Seattle's first black resident, Manuel Lopes (who arrived in 1858, just seven years after the Denny Party landed on Alki), also was a cook and a barber. Grose's hotel provided lodging for many of Seattle's earliest black residents, who arrived as transient laborers in the latter part of the nineteenth century.
Mining in Ravensthorpe considerably predates the current nickel mine, with gold discoveries dating back to 1898. The town experienced a down turn after the First World War but mining for copper continued up until the 1970s. A railway line connected Ravensthorpe with the port of Hopetoun from 1901 to 1925, when the line was closed.
