Joe Winder from "Geeked Out Nation" rated the episode with 8/10 saying that overall was a good episode with a great story that built some of the characters of the show but it completely forgot other main characters, like Irisa's story. "Some of what we learned could be used for future stories. My main issue is the big story was forgotten by everyone and leave me wondering if it’s big deal why did Irisa just forget about it for a few days. I know if it was me I would be freaking out wondering what’s going on."
