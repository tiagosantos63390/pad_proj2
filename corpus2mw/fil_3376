In the studio the girls are evaluated by the panel, with Anastasia being praised for her elegant body position. Sabrina manages to redeem herself in Nadege's eyes by producing a sophisticated pose and facial expression, thus earning appreciation from the judges. Marianna and Giorgia on the other hand are not positively judged for being too technical in their poses, Giusy points out Giorgia's face comes out vulgar in her shot and the panel agrees Marianna's facial expression is not well defined. Michael criticizes both girls for posing in a forced way. Caroline is noticed for her beauty that is once again her best asset, but Nadege is still unsatisfied by her lack of effort in posing, stating that the girl relies on it and does not give something more which is required in a fashion photo. Anisia disappoints Natasha and Michael for her heavy shoulders position and not having presence in her shot, even if her facial expression works.
