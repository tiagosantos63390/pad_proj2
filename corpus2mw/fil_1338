IPv6 routers do not support fragmentation or the "Don't Fragment" option. For IPv6, Path MTU Discovery works by initially assuming the path MTU is the same as the MTU on the link layer interface through which the traffic is being sent. Then, similar to IPv4, any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop the packet and send back an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" (Type 2) message containing its MTU, allowing the source host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is repeated until the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.
On 6 September 2011, the Swiss franc effectively switched to a euro peg: the Franc had always floated independently until its currency appreciation became unsustainable during the eurozone debt crisis. The peg involves a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 francs to the euro, currently there is no upper bound in place. The Swiss National Bank has committed to maintaining the exchange rate to ensure stability.

From 1901 to 1937, Taiwanese cinema was influenced immensely by Japanese cinema. Because of Taiwan's status as a Japanese colony, the traditions of Japanese movies were generally accepted by Taiwanese producers. For instance, the use of a "benshi" (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed "benzi" by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills.
In June 2007, he was strongly linked with a move from Le Havre to the Premier League with Aston Villa, Reading and West Ham United interested. However, he eventually opted to stay in France, and signed a three-year deal with Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain on 3 July 2007 for a transfer fee of €2.5 million. Digard made his debut for PSG in their opening match, a draw against Sochaux on 4 August 2007. His time at Paris Saint-Germain was frustrating due to little playing time and limited first team opportunities. Digard voiced his frustration over his delayed move to Boro and blamed the clubs board's "incompetence" for the delay. This resulted in his suspension by PSG.

It was during this time Paz released his debut solo album, "Season of the Assassin". Many critics said the album was a step forward for Paz as an artist. "Not only has he all-but perfected his grimy braggadocio, but he also exhibits unique storytelling abilities that will make critics who dismiss him as just another hardcore rapper bite their tongues clean off." said Sean Ryon, writer of "HipHopDX". It was supposed to be called "Assassin's Creed" but Paz changed it due to legal issues with Ubisoft. The release date for the album was on June 22, 2010. A few months later, Paz released the "Prayer for the Assassin" EP. The EP contained four remixed tracks from "Season of the Assassin" and a music video for the track "Keep Movin' on". It was only available for digital download and was released on 26 October 2010.

Years later, Beast detains Maurice, an old man, in the tower as a prisoner for trespassing (actually allowed inside by the servants for shelter). Maurice's daughter, Belle, confronts Beast and pleads with him to let her father go, offering herself as a prisoner instead. The Beast agrees, believing she is the key to break the spell, but when she enters the castle's forbidden west wing and nearly touches the rose, he frightens her into the woods (which he regrets upon realizing that he lost his temper), where he saves her from being killed by wild wolves. Beast comes to appreciate Belle when she tends to his wounds and he strikes up a friendship with her. Eventually, he falls in love with her, and placing her happiness before his own, he releases her to tend to her sick father.
