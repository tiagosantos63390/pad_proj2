Parker joined the National Youth Theatre, and after training at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He portrayed Bassanio in Peter Hall's 1989 production of "The Merchant of Venice" in both London and on Broadway, co-starring with Dustin Hoffman.

The album's success led to some strange ventures: one of the tracks, "Visa To Rock", was re-recorded by Overlord X with new lyrics relating to chess for a BBC documentary about the game fronted by a young Stephen Fry. A clip of the documentary, featuring Overlord X's re-recorded tune, was shown when Fry was a guest on Jonathan Ross' BBC chat show in 2005. His success also led to a long-running feud with fellow rapper MC Duke, which culminated in X recording the diss tune "Die Hard" about the rapper on his "You Oughta Get Rushed" (Mango, 1990) single.

Fleetwood Mac's "Rumours" went Platinum in 1977. The band Pablo Cruise recorded two Platinum-certified albums at the Record Plant: "A Place in the Sun" (1977) and "Worlds Away" (1978). Cory Lerios, keyboardist and vocalist for Pablo Cruise, said that, in recording "the better part of four albums" at the Record Plant, drug use enabled jam sessions that could last up to 36 hours: "It was a great time, no question." Another Platinum album that came out of Sausalito in 1978 was Dan Fogelberg's "Twin Sons of Different Mothers", a collaboration with Tim Weisberg on flute. Other albums did less well: Jimmy Cliff laid down the tracks for "Give Thankx" in Jamaica but he came to Sausalito to polish it up, with producers Bob Johnston and John Stronach giving guidance. Cliff loved the studio's laid-back atmosphere, and he said "Give Thankx" was his best work yet. However, the album did not chart.
