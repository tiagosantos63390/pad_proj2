Schwa at the end of a word is dropped when followed by a word beginning with a vowel. For example:
Koren began work on a new prayerbook in the 1970s. Koren created Koren Book Type for the project, and an innovative design for which the siddur would become famous. Rather than allow the text to run continuously across page turns, Koren maintained lines and paragraphs within individual pages. He set individual sentences line by line, according to their meaning. The result was a prayerbook, published in 1981, that facilitated uninterrupted prayer and elucidated the underlying meaning of the text. The siddur became one of the most widely used prayerbooks in Israel. In 2009, Koren Publishers Jerusalem introduced a new Hebrew-English edition of the Koren Siddur, the Koren Sacks Siddur, with an introduction, translation, and commentary by Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks.
