The 2013 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the Dodgers' 124th for the franchise in Major League Baseball, and their 56th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers dealt with a series of injuries to key players during the first half of the season and on June 21 were 31-42, 9 1/2 games back in last place in the NL West. Beginning with a 6-1 win over the San Diego Padres on June 22, the return of the injured players, and the emergence of rookie Yasiel Puig, they went 46-10 through August 23 as the rest of the division collapsed. On September 19, they clinched the Western Division title. This was the earliest the Dodgers had ever clinched a title and the largest deficit they had ever overcome to win the division. They opened the playoffs by defeating the Atlanta Braves in the Division Series and advanced to the NL Championship Series. In the NLCS, they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.
