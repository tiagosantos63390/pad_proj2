The village maintains multiple heritage citations including over the historically significant school. Established in 1897 when it was conducted in the local Church of England church, it operated for ten years as a Half Time school with Ledgerton, ten miles further north. This school was located beside the road from Queanbeyan to Urriarra, which crossed the Murrumbidgee River at Uriarra Crossing. After two periods operating as a Subsidised School (1907â€“10 and 1920-1926), a 'new' Uriarra school opened at the Uriarra Forestry Settlement in 1936 and operated there until 2001.
The SHADO codeword "sub smash" refers to an emergency at sea involving one of the vessels. In the episode "Sub-Smash" SkyDiver 1 is unable to surface after a UFO attack and sinks to the bottom of the sea. Sky 1 is barely able to launch, allowing Captain Waterman to notify SHADO of the vessel's location, but several crewmembers, including SHADO Commander Ed Straker, Paul Foster, and Nina Barry, are trapped below the surface. The episode reveals that emergency evacuation can be accomplished through the docking hatch, although only one or two crewmembers can use it at a time and the hatch much be cleared of water each time (a slow process should the pumps become damaged); use of this exit is also dependent upon the amount of battery power remaining with which to operate the pumps. An alternate, more dangerous egress route is via the torpedo tube, although in the "Sub-Smash" incident this exit malfunctions and fails to open.
