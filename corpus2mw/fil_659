Personal life.
On arriving at the Swan River Colony, the Bussells were advised to start a new sub-colony at Augusta. For four years the brothers tried unsuccessfully to establish a farm, initially at Augusta and then further up the Blackwood River. The brothers had immense difficulty clearing the land, and found the soil not particularly good for farming. Alfred's brother John conducted a number of exploring expeditions to the Vasse in search of better land, with Alfred accompanying him on at least two expeditions. The explorers found excellent farmland at the Vasse, so after the Bussell's home was destroyed by fire in 1834, the family re-established themselves at the Vasse, where they became successful and prosperous farmers.
