It has been anticipated that within the next few years of development that the Solomon Islands would be in a position to launch a bid to participate in the World Cup. Rugby League International Federation Development Officer and ex-Penrith, Canterbury-Bankstown and Paris Châtillon XIII player Tas Baitieri said: ""Other Pacific Islands countries played rugby league for 14 years before making it to the World Cup. Being familiar with the rugby league by watching other countries playing the code, Solomon Islands can pick up and make it in less than 14 years."" The SIRLF had announced that they would select players to compete in the Cook Islands 7's in 2009. However, the competition that included teams from across the Pacific Nations did not feature a Solomon Islands team. This is in addition to the inter-city tournament, the Honiara Rugby League (HRL) - which will feature 4 amateur teams and players from across Honiara. There will be two teams from the West and one each from the East and Central areas. SIRLF President William Tuhaika said that the purpose of the competition is to give players competitive opportunity to adjust to the new code of rugby on the Islands. He also stated that the league was to make up a national side to play the NSW Police side in October. There are already 60 players signed up to play in this competition for any one of the four sides with more anticipated as registration is still available. However, due to a hold-up in the jerseys being shipped in, from Australia on behalf of the ARL, the tournament looks like it will be delayed shortly. It is said that this will be a platform towards the 2010 tournament that the SIRLF hope will be a national event featuring interested amateur sides from across the Islands. It has also been announced that Tuhaika will attempt to place a bid for the Solomon Islands to take part in the Pacific Cup in the near future.

CocoonJS is a mobile development framework produced by Ludei.It enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, instead of device-specific languages such as Objective-C. It enables wrapping up of HTML, CSS and Javascript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and Javascript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly mobile native applications (because all layout rendering is done via web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely web-based (because they are not just web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). The platform is similar to Adobe PhoneGap but claims significant improvements.
