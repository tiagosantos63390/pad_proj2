Founding and history.
Robinson graduated M.B. in 1709, and M.D. in 1711, at Trinity College, Dublin. He was anatomical lecturer there in 1716–17, and in 1745 was appointed professor of physic. On 5 May 1712 he was elected fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, having been candidate on 24 August 1711. He was three times president of the college—in 1718, 1727, and 1739. He was also a member of the Irish Royal College of Surgeons. He practised in Dublin, and probably attended Esther Vanhomrigh (Jonathan Swift's "Vanessa"), who left him a legacy. He died at Dublin on 26 January 1754.
