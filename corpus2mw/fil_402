Much confusion has been caused by different renditions of the composer's names. In the Polish language (i.e. prior to his move to the USSR), his name was spelled as 'Mieczysław Wajnberg', whereas in the Russian language (i.e. after the move) he was and still is known as 'Моисей Самуилович Вайнберг' ("Moisey Samuilovich Vaynberg"). In the world of Yiddish theater of antebellum Warsaw he was known as "Moishe Weinberg" (), which is analogous to the Russian "Moisey". Among close friends he would also go by his Polish diminutive 'Mietek'. Re-transliteration of his surname from Cyrillic ("Вайнберг") back into the Latin alphabet produced a variety of spellings, including 'Weinberg', 'Vainberg', and 'Vaynberg'. The form 'Weinberg' is now being increasingly used as the most frequent English-language rendition of this common Jewish surname, notably in the latest edition of Grove and by Weinberg's biographer, Per Skans.

Lauda's McLaren MP4/2 broke its water pump at half-distance. Shortly afterwards Winkelhock stopped and Andrea de Cesaris crashed his Ligier JS23. Piquet found himself third behind after the stops but faded as the race neared its conclusion. Arnoux moved into third until he was caught by Rosberg. Piquet's BMW engine blew and with a lap to go Rosberg ran out of fuel, allowing Arnoux to join Alboreto and Warwick on the podium. Alboreto had given Goodyear its first win in Formula One. Rosberg was classified fourth. De Angelis finished fifth in his Lotus with Stefan Bellof completing the points finishers in his Tyrrell 012. Just nine cars finished although eleven were classified including the late retirements of Rosberg and Piquet.

This was also the first race to have a single qualifying session on Saturday afternoon; the Friday session had been dropped for 1996.
The Qualifying session was run as a one-hour session held on Saturday afternoon. Schumacher clinched his third consecutive pole position in his Ferrari, with a time of 1:36.293.
