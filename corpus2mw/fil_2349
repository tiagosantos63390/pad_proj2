Philadelphia's defense made a major improvement in the third quarter, limiting Arizona to 9 rushing yards, one completion, and no first downs. Meanwhile the Eagles cut the score to 24–13 with a 90-yard scoring drive. The Eagles converted three third downs on the drive, including McNabb's 50-yard completion to Curtis on 3rd and 19, and finished it off with a 6-yard touchdown reception by tight end Brent Celek. The Eagles quickly forced a punt on Arizona's ensuing possession, and Jackson returned it 13 yards to the Philadelphia 39-yard line. Five plays later, McNabb's threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Celek. Rather than try to cut their deficit to three points, Philadelphia decided to kick the extra point, but Akers' kick was no good, keeping the score at 24–19. It was the first time Akers had missed an extra point all season.

Needs a deep rich substrate and good light. Will withstand sub-tropical - tropical temperatures. A strong grower, too big for the average aquarium, the leaves soon growing out of the water. In the wild it grows in sticky mud along rivers. Rataj reports hybrids with "E. grandiflorus "and" E. longiscapus" which have mixed features. Supplement with iron and CO2 if possible. Seems to prefer soft to hard water.
