In October 1989 NUM help organize a Housing Now! march on Washington, D.C., in 1989. The event would be co-organized by the National Coalition for the Homeless, National Low-Income Housing Coalition, and Voices for Creative Non-violence NUH wanted militant nonviolent disobedience to push issues of the homeless to forefront. However, one of the funders of the march, the AFL-CIO, wanted a peaceful and legal event so other three organizations pushed against civil disobedience. In the end, NUH agreed to the legal march and would mobilize the homeless, however, they would end up planning a separate more confrontational protest the day before the Housing Now! Rally.
Reviews and accolades.
