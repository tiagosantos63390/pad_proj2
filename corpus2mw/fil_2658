The district is significant for its architecture, which includes many examples of Victorian architecture with rich detailing. The buildings in the district also reflect the institutions and people responsible with the development of Danielson. The town's growth began in 1809, when brothers James and Hezekiah Danielson built a cotton spinning mill, and was further fueled by other textile mills, the completion of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad through town in 1830, the establishment of other businesses, and the expansion of the textile mills from the 1850s onward. The houses in the Broad Street-Davis Park area were built by middle and upper-class residents, who chose the latest architectural styles and built large houses. The area also was above the river terrace, providing fine views and flood protection.

The main event of the show was CM Punk defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Hardy. Punk dominated the challenger early with a series of kicks and arm locks before Hardy escaped to the floor. Punk dove through the ropes at Hardy, only to crash as his opponent moved away only to have Hardy go for a dive of his own and Punk reciprocate with his own dodge. The champion made his way back to the ring in the hopes of the referee declaring him the winner via countout, the act of a wrestler failing to appear in the ring for the referee's count of 10; Hardy made his way back in the ring by nine. A frustrated Punk continued his assault with knees before Hardy countered with a rebound kick off the top turnbuckle called the Whisper in the Wind followed by a pinning attempt. Punk escaped the pin with a riding inverted chinlock for a submission attempt. Hardy escaped with some offense before ascending the top turnbuckle and attempting with his finishing maneuver, the Swanton bomb, only to have the champion lift his knees up, driving them into Hardy's back. Punk exploited his advantage, and hoisted Hardy onto his shoulders before dropping him into a knee to the face called the Go To Sleep (GTS). He went for the pin, only to have Hardy respond by the referee's count of two. Punk decided to leave the ring at that time in hopes of getting counted out, which would allow him to retain his championship. Hardy headed him off on the entrance ramp, and threw him in the ring. Once both men were back in the ring, Punk made one more attempt at the GTS only to have the challenger counter by grabbing his opponent by the head and dropping him to the mat with his signature move, the Twist of Fate. He then attempted the Swanton Bomb again, which fully connected for Hardy to pin Punk, winning the World Heavyweight Championship for the second time, his third World Championship overall.
