As usual, the album features some instrumentals mixed with songs performed by Helen Sjöholm, Tommy Körberg and Kalle Moraeus. This time, eight out of the 13 tracks have vocals, while only five songs are instrumentals. Most of the lyrics are once again written by Benny's former ABBA partner Björn Ulvaeus.

The de Noailles had an extensive correspondence with Francis Poulenc and commissioned him on two occasions. He received 25000 Francs for "Aubade", which he wrote for one of their balls at Place des États-Unis where it premiered on 18 June 1929. "Le Bal Masqué", inspired by Max Jacob's "Le Laboratoire Central", was written for a private celebration on 20 April 1932 at the municipal theatre in Hyères.
Environmental license to implement the project was granted by Colombia's Environment Ministry, which was announced by Alvaro Uribe, the then President of Colombia, in May 2009.
