Having freed his friends, Stark confronts Stane and the villain learns that even in the Iron Monger armor, he is no match for Stark. Finally, Stane uses his last card: Gertl Anders' infant son, whom Stane had abducted from an orphanage. Stane tells Stark to remove his helmet or he will crush the baby. Stark, having detected interfering frequencies in his armor's systems throughout the battle, deduces that Stane isn't experienced enough to pilot the armor without some help via an external computer. He uses his armor's pulse bolts to destroy the building containing that computer, causing Stane's Iron Monger armor to seize up. Refusing to be arrested and humiliated, Stane fires his repulsor ray beam into his head, disintegrating his skull. Stark later regains complete control over his own company, which he renames Stark Enterprises.

Later at the tavern, a police inspector from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown the matter of the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.

's persona has been portrayed through her no nonsense business minded ways. Chambers has described Rosemary as having a business woman's "take-no-prisoners" attitude. Chambers also stated during an interview in 2003, the reasons why she believed Rosemary was popular with viewers, stating: "I think some of her popularity is due to the fact that she could be relied upon to stir things up; that she was not wishy washy and that she stood her ground with men the same way she did with women." Also adding that Rosemary worked better as a recurring character because of her personality. Chambers has also claimed Rosemary's hidden softer side was shown whilst adopting Tracey Dawson, helping her mother Anne and to the rest of her family. Of why her character was portrayed in this way, Chambers has said: "Reg Watson came up with the Rosemary Daniels character as an alternative to many women in the street who were mothers or young women growing up and feeling their way. So yes she symbolised the strength of the female in the Neighbours' saga. Perhaps you could say that Rosemary was there as a point of reference for the emancipated female. Yet mums and married women in the viewing audience related to her too because Rosemary did fall in love a few times. She would have married but the relationships always ended sadly and so she never did. I think Rosemary realised she was in truth, 'married' to her work: it gave her great joy."
