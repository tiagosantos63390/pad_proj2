In mathematics, the Freudenthal magic square (or Freudenthal–Tits magic square) is a construction relating several Lie algebras (and their associated Lie groups). It is named after Hans Freudenthal and Jacques Tits, who developed the idea independently. It associates a Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras "A", "B". The resulting Lie algebras have Dynkin diagrams according to the table at right. The "magic" of the Freudenthal magic square is that the constructed Lie algebra is symmetric in "A" and "B", despite the original construction not being symmetric, though Vinberg's symmetric method gives a symmetric construction; it is not a magic square as in recreational mathematics.

Donald Dinnie, the son of a stonemason, won his first sporting event, at the age of 16, in the nearby village of Kincardine O'Neil. He defeated the local wrestling strongman David Forbes, and took first place which included £1 prize money. In 1860, Dinnie undertook a feat of strength that was to give birth to a long-lasting legacy. He carried two boulders, with a combined weight of , for a distance of about , across the Potarch Bridge and back. Each boulder had an iron ring fixed to it, so that scaffolds could be attached from which workmen could repair the bridge, over the River Dee near Kincardine O'Neil. The original stones are now located outside the 18th-century Potarch Hotel, on the south bank of the river by the Potarch Bridge.
"Amnesia" represented another step in the development of Al Columbia's technique. While he had made striking use of sharp outlines and silhouettes in earlier works such as "I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool" and "The Blood-Clot Boy", in "Amnesia" he used a combination of watercolor, acrylic paint, ink, charcoal, and digital tools to create minutely detailed chiaroscuro backgrounds that contrast with the cartoony look of the characters. As Paul Gravett commented: "Al works his flat, outlined Seymour and his pal into what look like soft focussed stills from some vintage black and white animated film. His bigfoot characters scurry about amongst period buildings and backgrounds that are richly textured and photorealist, bathed centre stage in glowing light, but shrouded in threatening shadow in the wings. He bans all speech bubbles and sets his perky text in eye-straining type above the image or in framed boxes."

The Internationale Junge Orchesterakademie (IJOA), or International Youth Orchestra Academy, is an international range orchestra for young people, based in Pleystein, Bavaria. It has special associations with the Bayreuth Easter Festival. The organization has three aims: to help and support children suffering from cancer in those regions and areas where the concerts of the IJOA orchestra take place; the promotion of young musicians; and to develop the international understanding of the musicians, who come from different backgrounds from all over the world, and meet to make music and play together in one orchestra.
Many memorials were erected to the memory of British soldiers, religious leaders, educationists, police officers, engineers, businessmen, judges, medical officers and their families. There is a tablet for the Rt. Rev. Robert Caldwell, who for 53 years devoted himself to the furtherance of the Gospel among the Tamil people of Tirunelveli. Well known as a scholar and philologist, he served also as assistant to the Bishop of Madras and died at Kodaikanal in 1891. From another tablet, we see that Frederick Rowlandson was Registrar of the Diocese of Madras for 53 years and died in 1929. Similarly we see from a plaque that Edward Sell, Canon of St. George’s Cathedral had worked for 67 years in Madras and died in 1932 at the age of 93. John Mousley, the first Archdeacon in Madras (1815–1819) has a commemoration tablet by Flaxman.

Etoxadrol is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It binds irreversibly and with high affinity to the PCP binding site on the NMDA receptor (Ki = 107 nM, determined by the displacement of radiolabeled TCP). the neurotransmitter glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, and the postsynaptic cell membrane is depolarized (from the postsynaptic cell being activated), the magnesium block in the NMDA receptor channel is displaced. Calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) can enter the cell via the open channel, while potassium (K+) can exit the cell. Etoxadrol antagonizes the NMDA receptor by binding to the PCP site, located just above the magnesium block in the ion channel. In the event that the magnesium block is displaced, etoxadrol blocks the NMDA receptor channel, preventing cations from entering or exiting the channel. This mechanism of action also applies to PCP, TCP, ketamine and dexoxadrol.
