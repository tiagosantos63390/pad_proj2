Okoh ("Ana Oko") is an Igbo speaking town in south eastern Nigeria. It is one of the 16 major towns that make up the geo-political area called Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra state. Okoh has five villages commonly referred to as EBENESE, and forty-five wards known as Umunna. The names of the villages are Ezioko, Eziabor, Okeani, Ihengwu and Ifite. It has the geographical coordinates of 6° 3' 0" North, 7° 06' 0" East. Okoh is regarded as a citadel of learning due to the early embrace of western educations and establishment of first Polytechnic in the old Anambra (present Anambra, Enugu and part of Ebonyi) State in the town. It is also widely recognized because of its erosion site which has baffled geologists for many years and records have it that it is supposedly deeper than the Grand Canyon. The importance of Okoh in the old Aguata Local Government Area (comprising Aguata, Orumba North and South) cannot be overemphasized when one notes that among the prominent sons of Aguata of colonial era inscribed on a marble wall within the Local Government secretariat, Okoh has the highest number. These include the late Chiefs John Ifeakor, Ebenezer Otaluka( Aharinta), and Jerry Nwosu. The inscription is still there to date. Chief Otaluka was reputed to be the first person to own and drive a private car in the whole of Aguata Division. He was also said to have built the "first one story house" in the Division. His one story house has glass windows. People from far and near came to see this mansion of those days. Today a road he pioneered is named after him in Okoh and is called Ezi-Ahari.

Female-female pairing has also been documented and studied in several tern species including Whiskered ("Chlidonias hybyida"), Roseate ("Sterna dougalii") and Caspian Terns ("Hydroprogne caspia") with similar attributes (supernormal clutches and reduced hatching/fledging success as compared to heterosexual pairs) to same-sex gull pairs. Also in the order Charadriiformes (family Chionididae), there has been one reported occurrence of a female-female pair in the Black-faced Sheathbill ("Chionis minor"), but eggs in the clutch proved to be inviable.
