The modern crest badge of a member of Clan Crawford contains the crest: "a stag's head erased Gules, between the attires a cross crosslet fitchée Sable". Encircling the crest on the crest badge is a strap and buckle engraved with the motto: "TUTUM TE ROBORE REDDAM" which translates from Latin as "I will give you safety through strength". The Crawford tartan is of relatively modern origin, and it is certain that there was no Crawford tartan in around 1739. The first record of a Crawford tartan is that of the "Crawfovrd" which appeared in the "Vestiarium Scoticum" of 1842. This is the Crawford tartan used today. The "Vestiarium" was the work of the Sobieski Stuarts who claim their book was a reproduction of ancient manuscript about clan tartans. Today many clan tartans are derived from the "Vestiarium".
