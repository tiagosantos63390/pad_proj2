The DC Comics character Lobo, an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term "bastich" or "bastiches" as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. "Take that you lousy bastiches!"
The band's origin dates back to the mid-19th century when some of the pupils requested that instruments be purchased to enliven their marching drill. The Treasurer of Christ's Hospital agreed and, with money from his own pocket, purchased a few instruments and paid the salary of the first Band Master. Over the years, the Band has grown from a small static group to a dynamic and highly trained group of musicians. At some point in the history of the band, the march 'Sussex by the Sea' was adopted as the celebratory march and is played as a finale at special occasions usually as the band marches off.

Note:
Lord Elphinstone established the "Central Museum of Natural History, Economy, Geology, Industry and Arts", the first museum in Bombay in 1855; George Buist took the major initiative for its inception. In 1857, it was closed to the public and its collection was shifted to the Town Hall. In 1858, George Birdwood was appointed curator of the museum. Soon, a committee was formed, comprising him, Bhau Daji Lad and Jagannath Shankerseth to raise money for construction of a new building for the museum. The foundation of the new building was laid in 1862. It was built with the patronage of many wealthy Indian businessmen and philanthropists like David Sassoon, Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy and Jaganath Shunkerseth.
