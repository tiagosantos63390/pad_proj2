History.
The Second Battle of the Marne or the Battle of Reims, fought from 15 July to 6 August 1918, was the last major German attack of their five phase Spring Offensive, the German attack failing when an Allied counterattack led by French forces and including several hundred tanks overwhelmed the Germans on their right flank, inflicting severe casualties. The German defeat marked the start of the relentless Allied advance which culminated in the Armistice about 100 days later. Thus the Second Battle of the Marne can be considered as the beginning of the end of the Great War whereas the First Battle of the Marne really marked the beginning of what was to be a static war dominated by the trenches rather than the planned war of movement and manoeuvre.

"Sentimental Imperialists" received mostly positive reviews from academic and journalistic critics. It was welcomed by Kenneth Shewmaker as a "thoughtful overview" and "a masterpiece of condensation and multicultural analysis," and went on to say the authors "effectively combined their expertise to fashion an impressive multicultural study that cogently encapsulates two hundred years of American-East Asian relations". Cohen also evaluated the book positively, deeming several of its chapters "superb, (...) well-written, thoughtful, and informative", and Van Alstyne said he was inclined to "second the praise lavished upon it by a number of prominent writers quoted on the dust jacket." Kwok recommended that "policymakers and general readers ought to have this book on their shelves, after attentive perusal".
During the Khemedian civil war, Bab El Ehr's insurgents who are trying to overthrow the Emir, attack a group of soldiers taking Tintin captive, incapacitating two with a smoke bomb and capturing Tintin in the process. In the "The Red Sea Sharks", Bab El Ehr ousts the Emir in a coup d'Ã©tat against the government, him and his army are seen in Wadesdah. After Mohammed ben Kalish Ezab retakes power, Bab El Ehr is presumably executed.
