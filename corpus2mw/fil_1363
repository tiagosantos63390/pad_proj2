Chapel Hill Mall features three anchor stores: Sears, JCPenney and Macy's, which opened in 1966 before the mall proper. Macy's operates in an anchor that was originally occupied by local chain O'Neil's until 1989, May Co. until 1993, and Kaufmann's from 1993 to 2006. There used to be a multi-screen cinema at the mall as well. It opened in October 1966 as a two-screen theater, and eventually expanded to five screens. In 1987, General Cinemas (owner of the mall's cinema) opened an 8-screen multiplex just west of the mall, and in October 1996, Regal Cinemas opened their 10-screen theater immediately south of the mall. Less than two weeks later, the General Cinemas at the mall closed, and Old Navy took over the former theater. Woolworth also operated a store at the mall until 1997. It was later occupied by The Gap which has since closed as well.
