Canne complains bitterly of his subsequent banishment from Hull. On 2 April 1658, when he was in the pulpit of the meeting-place in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, the marshal of the city entered and arrested him and seven of the brethren who had protested against their rough treatment of the old man. Canne was brought before the lord mayor, and acknowledged that he was not satisfied with the government, and would like an opportunity to tell the Protector so, but declined to enter upon the question with the magistrate. One of the accused, Wentworth Day, was fined and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. John Clark, who had been acquitted by the jury was fined and imprisoned for six months. Canne and the remainder were released on 25 April 1658. A narrative of the transaction was published. Canne was resident in August 1659 at his house in London and the date of his final retreat from England is not known. Canne was the object of some satirical writings of Samuel Butler, who published 'The Acts and Monuments of our late Parliament,' 1659, under the pseudonym of John Canne.
