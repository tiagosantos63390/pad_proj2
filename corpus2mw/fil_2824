The Germans began to use weather ships by the summer of 1940. However, three of its four ships were sunk by November 23, which led to the use of fishing vessels for its weather ship fleet. Their weather ships were out to sea for three to five weeks at a time. Weather observations from the Germans were ciphered using their Enigma machines.

Gaziyev graduated from the Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University and has a Candidate of Sciences degree in Physics and Mathematics. From 1968 to 1990, he worked as an associate professor of mathematics at the same institution. In 1988, he became one of the founders and first fifteen members of the sovereigntist Popular Front of Azerbaijan. He was known for his radical nationalist viewpoints and vehement support of Abulfaz Elchibey. Gaziyev was arrested in the summer of 1990 as an organiser of the anti-Soviet riots leading to the Black January massacre, and was incarcerated in the Lefortovo prison in Moscow. He was freed upon being elected to the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan later that summer, although his criminal case was never closed. With the escalation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Shusha becoming one of the few remaining Azerbaijani strongholds in the region, Gaziyev took command of the city's defence in January 1992.

Because of its scenic location on the banks of the Ganges, the fort and the palace are frequently used as an outdoor shooting location for films. The film titled "Banaras" is one of the popular movies shot here.
In 1811 a special Act was passed to reform St. Peter's church itself. The post of sacrist was replaced by that of perpetual curate. Three readerships were abolished and their income signed over to the curate. A fund was established from proceeds of mining on the deanery land to improve the income of the curate. This did not go far enough. The curate was still heavily dependent on fees from the dependent chapels and friction over this continued to sour relations. However, the curates initially performed their duties very much better than earlier sacrists and things were improved further by the building of a new chapel of ease in the town: St. George's, another Neo-Classical structure, completed in 1830 to a design by James Morgan.
Marksman was founder or co-founder of several organizations, including the African and Caribbean Rights Organization, the African Mobilization Committee, and the Patrice Lumumba Coalition.

The Meriam Report emphasized the need for education but it suggested that such education should be based on integration of Indian children into the majority culture, rather than educating Indian children in separate institutions, as previous education policies had stressed. The first line in the education section states, “The most fundamental need in Indian education is a change in point of view.” The report was particularly critical of Indian boarding schools: “The survey staff finds itself obligated to say frankly and unequivocally that the provisions for the care of the Indian children in boarding schools are grossly inadequate.” The survey team concluded that the boarding schools provided poor diet, were overcrowded, did not provide sufficient medical services, were supported by student labor, and relied on a uniform curriculum rather than raising teacher standards. While the report drew attention to the gross deficiencies of Indian boarding school education, the assimilationist policies of Indian education, dependent on such boarding schools, continued for another 40 years. The schools reached their peak student enrollment of 60,000 in the 1970s.

The ruckman had given away the game briefly in 1902 to become a field umpire but returned to South Melbourne after officiating in a couple of games.

A fire broke out just before midnight on September 21 at the packed "King of the Dancers Club" (S: 舞王俱乐部, P: "Wǔ Wáng Jùlèbù") according to an official with the Shenzhen Work Safety Bureau. The fire was started by a floorshow stunt involving fireworks that ignited the ceiling, plunging the club into darkness and causing the club-goers to panic and stampede towards the exits. The windows were boarded up and there was only one exit with a lit exit sign.

In Colha, Belize, archaeologists discovered a large pit next to a stairway near the center of a monumental structure (operation 2010). This "Skull Pit" contained the heads of around 30 individuals. Ten of these were children ranging in age from 6 months to 6 or 7 years old. The remaining 20 individuals were adults. There were cut marks on the crania and the remains were burnt, and the age grouping and the location of the pit has led to multiple conclusions on the reasons behind these sacrifices. One theory is that they were sacrificed as a part of a religious ceremony. Other hypotheses are that the victims were political prisoners treated with ritual violence or that they were ancestors of an elite lineage that was violently deposed.
Photography: The players were split into three groups and assigned to take nine photographs or videos involving townspeople. Getting eight out of the nine would win $10,000 for the kitty, but if fewer than eight were recorded, each one under that threshold would cost $1,000 from the kitty. The first was to take a picture of themselves with ten strangers, all of whom must be over 18 and everyone must be looking directly into the camera. They all completed this quickly, but Kris, Nathan, and Alison were a person short and had to do it again. The next task was for Cam and Petrina (and subsequently Nathan and Alison, and Josh and Nikki from the groups of three) to take a photo wearing one another's clothes, except for underwear. The third task was to record 15 seconds of a New Caledonian local, who must again be an adult, singing the chorus of Waltzing Matilda in English. Nathan, Kris, and Alison were behind the other groups in time and only barely made it back to the hotel before their one hour time limit was up. All of Josh, Nikki, and Shaun's pictures counted, but the local that that Nathan, Kris, and Alison recorded singing "Waltzing Matilda" was clearly under the age of 18. Additionally, the memory chip that Cam and Petrina handed in had nothing at all on it, so only five of the events counted, costing the group $3,000 from the kitty.

Bill Riley's redesigned Mk III was simpler in its design, allowing more variety for customers as well as a low cost. Although the extreme aerodynamics of the original design were gone, the car was conceived to be fast enough to compete for overall wins. The redesign and eventual construction of the first car took only four months. The chassis featured a steel tube frame with panels made of carbon fiber. Behind the cockpit the engine bay was designed to be large enough to allow for a variety of naturally aspirated engines, mostly the V8s of Ford, Chevrolet, and Oldsmobile that were common amongst IMSA GT privateers. All cars used a 5-speed transmission. The suspension consisted of double wishbones with coil springs attached by a pushrod. A power steering system was also part of the standard Mk III.
Originally, the neighborhood was composed mostly of single-family row houses and some industry. The Depression left many homes in disrepair, leading the city to raze them in the late 1930s to build the Richard Allen Homes, a massive public housing project that replaced blighted areas as well as provided housing for new workers attracted to the city for wartime production. The Richard Allen Homes remained Poplar's defining physical characteristic for the next several decades. Budget cuts by the city effected an egregious degree of deterioration in the homes, and poorly planned open spaces encouraged crime, generating notoriety as a center for crime and drug trafficking by the 1970s and 1980s.

ScreenCrush explains that remnants of the previous version of the film can be seen in this sequence:
Sad to say, condition of women is not very good in this village but they don't complain about it. They are happy in their daily routine like the women in any other village. After marriage they are required to cover their face with a ghoonghat (veil or headscarf). A woman will cover her face from all men to whom she's related by marriage and who are senior to her own husband. This would include for example her husband's father, elder brother and uncles. Generally a pallu (the loose end of a sari) is pulled over the head to act as a ghunghat. A dupatta (long scarf) is also sometimes used as a ghoonghat.
In 2007 Canterbury Prison was converted to hold only foreign national prisoners in the UK. This was to allow a centralisation of specialised immigration and language services for foreign prisoners, as well as to allow dedicated immigration officials to work on the deportation of as many inmates as possible (on completion of their sentence).
