Ginetta Cars announced in November 2010 that they were going to be building a new sports car, and named it as the G55. In February 2011, the car was released, as a more powerful evolution of the G50. The G55 featured a Ford-sourced 3.7 litre V6, producing 370 hp, in addition to a 6-speed sequential manual gearbox, built by Hewland. The new car did not replace the G50; instead, it supplemented it, and the Ginetta G50 Cup was rebranded as the Ginetta GT Supercup. The G55 was available for sale for £75,000, or as an upgrade from the G50 for £25,000. The car made its British GT debut in the Oulton Park rounds of the 2011 season, with four separate entries competing; the best result of the event came courtesy of Century Motorsport, whom took a ninth place finish at the second race of the day. Century Motorsport were also responsible for the car's best finish of the season; a fourth place at Rockingham Motor Speedway, in the first race of the day. A GT3 test mule was run by Rollcentre Racing (using the Cup engine with some GT3-specification components) in the 2011 Britcar 24 Hours; however, the car failed to finish the race.

On 24 June 2013, WikiLeaks said that Harrison accompanied National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on a high-profile flight from Hong Kong to Moscow en route to political asylum from US extradition. Dominic Rushe of "The Guardian" observed that Harrison was a "strange choice" because of her lack of legal qualifications compared to other WikiLeaks staff, such as human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson. At the time, she had been with the organisation for over two years. On 1 August 2013, Harrison accompanied Snowden out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport after he was granted a year of temporary asylum.

At the peak of their popularity, the group was classified as folk music. The Abbey Tavern Singers intended to create a relaxed, informal atmosphere reminiscent of the original tavern performances. In the middle of a concert stage, this did not always come off as well has hoped. Partly this was because the Singers had not developed a stage act, and were known to appear disinterested when not participating in a given number. While their performances of some songs such as "This Land Is Your Land" were noted for their energy, performances of other songs were panned as maudlin. The group was positively cited for their lack of gimmicks when performing. Although the group name indicated a vocal ensemble, they were praised for their instrumental work in concerts. At one time this included the only full-time Irish spoon player, PJ Downes, who exclusively used Irish nickel-silver spoons for performing, and was known to place tours on hold if the right spoons were unavailable to him Their set lengths were noted for their generosity. In addition to concerts, the Singers would also participate in folk masses while on tour.
