Archaeological evidence suggests that Sardinia was settled about 8000 years ago, although human occupation has been noted at least 20,000 years ago. During the Neolithic period, black obsidian drew other Mediterraneans to the Island. The local contributions (Italian peninsula via Corsica, Balearic Islands) and Eastern Mediterranean genetic influences have been single out as founding populations on the Island. HLA class II typing (HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) of Sardinians revealed that they fell outside of the European cluster and tended to fall in the Greek and Bulgarian cluster. Subsequently, proposed the origins about peoples in the Aegean region was at least in part from sub-Saharan Africa. Prior to this study Class I loci (See HLA) were typed as part of a global typing workshop held in 1991; In addition, 551 families were typed deriving 2202 HLA A,B, Cw Haplotypes in 1992 At the time A30-B18 had been noted in Algerian Berbers, and in the South of France. Subsequently, studies by Antonio Arniaz-Villena and 4 other groups on HLA Class I loci revealed that allele frequency patterns of the Northwestern Mediterranean clustered together and with peoples of North Africa and the Middle East. In light of the HLA distinctions of Sardinians and common belief that the Island was inhabited from the north, A30-B18-DR3, the most frequent haplotype, did not reconcile with many opinions on Sardinian origins.
