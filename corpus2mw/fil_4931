Act II is based on an Ethiopian folk tale, "Justice". The story is as follows: a young man is preparing a meal over a fire when an old goatherder approaches, searching for a lost kid. She asks the man if he has seen the kid. The man is deaf, does not understand the question, and subsequently gestures the old woman away. She misunderstands this as direction towards the location of the lost kid, wanders off, and finds it, and returns to offer thanks. Upon her return, the man grows angry and belligerent for being disturbed a second time, and a crowd gathers. The villagers force the two to consult with the Justice of the Peace, who is both deaf and myopic. In yet another misunderstanding, the judge takes the quarrel as a marital dispute, and orders the two to go home together with their 'child'.

The Yangtze River is derived from the mountain glacier. The ice and snow mel into streams, and streams become torrents, rushing into the East China Sea. Afterwards, the currents of warm air take the water vapour back to the mountain, and the process starts all over again. It is the water naturally flowing in cycles that silently bears the mysterious taoism of "climate" and "acceleration"!

Synopsis.
Participating nations.
The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. Jonathan Holland of the "Variety" wrote, ""Ocean's Eleven" tries to become a Hispanic "Magnificent Seven" in "Winning Streak" a disappointingly straight-ahead take on one family’s high-risk attempt to get rich by beating the casinos. Despite its terrific real-life storyline, a couple of fine perfs and slick visuals, the pic stumbles in its eagerness to please all comers, failing to generate much real tension and leaving its characters as flat as poker chips". Sonia Sanz of Cultture.com criticized actors Daniel Brühl, Lluís Homar, Oriol Vila, Eduard Fernández and Blanca Suárez for their "underwhelming" performances, and called the film itself "disappointing". Emilio Luna of the "El Antepenúltimo Mohicano" gave the film a rather negative review and awarded it with four out of ten stars.
