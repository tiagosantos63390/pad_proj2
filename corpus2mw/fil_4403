Mike and Annmaria Coriam, Rebecca's parents, were flown out from England to meet the ship when it returned. They met the Bahamian detective and said he told them he had spent only one day on board investigating before flying back home. The detective also told him he had interviewed only a few crew members, and none of the passengers. They claimed Disney kept them in a car with blacked-out windows and brought them on board via a little-used side entrance after all the passengers had disembarked. The "Wonder"'s captain gave his condolences and expressed his theory that Rebecca had been washed overboard by a wave while at the crew pool, a theory they doubted due to the high walls around it. After that, they were taken to a meeting with Disney executives and the woman Rebecca had been speaking to on the phone.

Since 2006 the Collection has been managed by a team of volunteers, The Friends of the Cardall Collection. However, the collection is at risk because it does not have a suitable, permanent home. The Friends of the Cardall Collection's primary aim is to establish a permanent home for the collection within Southam Town Centre, to enable it to be used for the benefit of the wider community. Membership of the Friends is open to anyone interested in the history of Southam and its surrounding villages.
