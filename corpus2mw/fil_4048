His predecessor in Zurich had been the energetic Eduard August von Regel, who took up the respected position of director of the Imperial Botanic Garden in St. Petersburg. The Zurich Botanical Garden was poorly subsidised, necessitating the sale of plants and seed in order to cover its running costs. Ortgies was able to raise more than enough money for this purpose, so that the Garden was able to carry out urgently needed renovation of the old conservatories, start the building of new conservatories, improve the water supply, and create an Alpine rock garden. As reward for his efforts, Ortgies received the title of Inspector and a considerable increase in his salary.

The Messina tram depot (in Italian: "Deposito tranviario Messina") is the largest tram depot in Milan, Italy, and one of the largest in the world. It is located at street number 14 of Via Messina, close to the Monumentale cemetery. The building of the depot, which dates back to 1912, is a prominent example of early 20th century Milanese industrial architecture, and one of the most important examples of cast-iron architecture in Italy. The depot is still in use by "Azienda Trasporti Milanesi" ("ATM") public transport company. Due to its historical and architectural relevance, ATM occasionally opens the depot to visitors.

The "present" sections are told in comics form while the "past" portions are told in flowery prose sections, which the reader finds out later are written by Oscar (and are in Sim's imitation of Wilde's writing style), unknown to Jaka and based on what Oscar has heard from Rick.

The Great Indian Love Story.
Although throughout the 1940s and 1950s existentialism was the dominant European intellectual movement, in the 1960s it was starting to lose its influence in the face of growing negative response. During the 1960s, there would be little or no existentialist movement to speak of, and what popularity it had would become far more overshadowed by structuralism, post-structuralism, and postmodernism, intellectual approaches which are today still widely used in academia. However, existentialism, particularly existential phenomenology, would still remain a significant influence on post-structuralism and postmodernism; one commentator has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called "post-phenomenologists." Like existentialism, these approaches reject essentialist or reductionist notions, and are critical of dominant Western philosophy and culture, rejecting previous systems of knowledge based on the human knower. Since the 1980s, therefore, a growing number of anarchist philosophies, represented by the term "post-anarchism," have used post-structuralist and postmodernist approaches.

Definitions.
Nationalism had a different meaning for K.T. Paul. According to him “Indian nationalism is not Indian politics but a great social revolution of which politics is but a part.” Paul’s idea of nationalism was not inconsistent with the spirit of Christ. Out of his Old Testament studies, he defined nationalism as a discipline for a certain well defined purpose. To Him the secret spring of natioism was different from “unity in regard to religion, language and government,” but was recognition by individual persons of something as their common interests, some great object which over-rides individual interest. Thus did he connect nationalism to Church.


Statues of Pauline can be found on the grounds of the Lindenhaus in Lemgo and in park of Bad Meinberg. A plaque is attached to a building at the Castle Square in Detmold. An association name "Pauline's daughters", a mineral spring at Bad Salzuflen name "Pauline spring", and a number of street names in several towns in Lippe, all remind us of the Princess. The Princess Pauline Foundation in Detmold still exists and focusses on assisting young people and the elderly. The foundation runs a number of day care centers and strives help people in need in the spirit of the Princess.
