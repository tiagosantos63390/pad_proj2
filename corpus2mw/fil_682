The Young Nationals do not support increasing the driving age and believe that it unjustly impacts on young people, without dealing with the real causes of poor driver skill levels.

"D'eux" is the best-selling French-language album of all time, with sales of 10 million copies worldwide. In France, "D'eux" was certified diamond and after selling over 4,412,100 copies, it became the best-selling album ever in that country. It spent 44 consecutive weeks at the top of the French chart and 137 weeks on the chart in total, breaking sales records. When Dion's next album, "Falling into You" was released in 1996 it debuted at number 2 on the French chart, since the first slot was still being occupied by "D'eux". Dion was also the most-played act on the French radio in 1995, as well as the best-selling recording artist.
