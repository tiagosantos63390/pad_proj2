Prior to 2007, only a few websites made use of non-personal profile pages. Last.fm, established in 2002, used its music recommendation service to automatically generate "artist pages" which serve as portals for biographies, events and artist-related playlists. This approach, however, is not explicitly controlled by artists or music groups because of the automatic nature of artist pages; pages, for example, could be created from erroneous misspellings and miscredits of works which are accepted as-is by the Audioscrobbler recommendation service used by Last.fm. Furthermore, Last.fm has never advertised itself as a social networking service, despite accruing myriad social features since 2002.
