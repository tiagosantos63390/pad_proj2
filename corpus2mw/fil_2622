While still serving as an Alderman for the City of Calgary, Shrake ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1982 Alberta general election. He won the electoral district of Calgary Millican defeating New Democrat candidate David Swann by a wide margin. He would run for his second term in office in the 1986 Alberta general election. This race proved to be a lot closer for Shrake as his popular vote was cut in half from 1982. Swann ran against him for the second time doubling his popular vote, but not gaining enough support to win. Shrake would run for a third and final term in the 1989 Alberta general election. He would gain enough popular support to defeat New Democrat candidate Bill Flookes by just over 100 votes. Shrake retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the Assembly in 1993.

The area surrounding Brunswick Town was originally inhabited by the Tuscarora Native Americans. After these natives were defeated in the Tuscarora War (1711–15), English colonists began to move into the Cape Fear region. Brunswick Town was founded in July 1726 by Maurice Moore with the help of his brother Roger, owner of the nearby Orton Plantation. The two men were sons of South Carolina colonial governor James Moore and grandsons of Irish nobleman Rory Moore. Maurice, a future colonial governor and father of Supreme Court Associate Justice Alfred Moore, named the town after Brunswick-Lüneburg, the German territory ruled by Great Britain's reigning King George I. During the next few months, Brunswick Town grew rapidly and became a busy port for exporting forest products used for the Royal Navy and merchant ships, tar, pitch, and turpentine. When the village of Newton, now known as Wilmington, was founded in 1733, the two towns jointly formed the Port of Brunswick.

In 1875 the Khedive of Egypt had gone bankrupt and needed to sell shares in the Suez Canal (of whose traffic four-fifths was British) in order to gain money. Disraeli purchased 176,602 shares in the Canal in order to stop the imperial lifeline to India and Australia falling into French hands. Disraeli persuaded Lionel de Rothschild to lend the British government the £4m needed to purchase the shares. Because the Khedive had mortgaged the shares until 1894 the British government only received the mortgage payments of approximately £200,000 a year. However in 1895 the British government received a dividend of £690,000; in 1901 it was £880,000. The market value of the shares also rose: in 1898 they had risen from £4m to £24m and were rising at around £2m a year. By 1914 they were worth over £40m.
