On July 16, 2007, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a ninety-day stay of execution in order to allow the evaluation of evidence presented, including the doubts about Davis's guilt. The stay was superseded by the August 2007 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court to grant Davis’ application for discretionary appeal from the denial of his Extraordinary Motion for a New Trial. Defense lawyers requested a new trial based on statements of mistaken identity. On March 17, 2008, the Georgia Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 4–3 majority. The majority wrote that the recanting witnesses "have merely stated they now do not feel able to identify the shooter", that the trial testimony could not be ignored, and that they "in fact, favor that original testimony over the new." In dissent, the Chief Justice wrote that "if recantation testimony, either alone or supported by other evidence, shows convincingly that prior trial testimony was false, it simply defies all logic and morality to hold that it must be disregarded categorically".
Ptychadena submascareniensis
Inhibition of fusion is necessary to prevent spontaneous exocytosis of vesicles into the synapse. If a clamp does not hold synaptic vesicle pools stable and inhibit them from fusing, the potential for spontaneous firing and depletion of the vesicle pool is much greater. It is believed that the C-terminal domain of complexin is responsible for this inhibitory function. In several eukaryotic organisms, mutations to complexin were linked to dramatic increases in spontaneous exocytosis rates.
The AR-10 was procured in 1958 for testing as a possible replacement for the G1 rifle (FN FAL). It was designated the "Gewehr 4" ("Rifle No.4"), or G4. It lost out to a modified version of the CETME rifle by Heckler & Koch designated the G3.
