Pontypridd Urban District Council was a local authority in Glamorgan, Wales. It was created in 1894 as a result of the 1894 Local Government of England and Wales Act and the Pontypridd Urban District Council election, 1894 saw the election of the first members of the authority. The Council existed until 1973 and replaced the Pontypridd Local Board of Health which had functioned for some years. Its boundaries were set in 1894. Initially, the Council had eighteen members but this was increased some years later, as a result of the increase in population. There were six wards, namely Cilfynydd, Graig, Pontypridd Town, Rhondda, Trallwn and Treforest.

Sessue Hayakawa, Aoki's soon-to-be husband, played her father in the film; they married on May 1 just before the film's release. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week and, seeing another chance to publicize his production, Ince stated that Hayakawa was "the highest paid of all oriental stars." The film's shipwreck scene was shot off the coast of Santa Monica, and an erupting volcano was also included among its lavish effects. This was the first feature film appearance of Hayakawa and the directorial debut of Barker.
