The King Cobras are a Central Auckland based gang with its origins born out of the Polynesian Panthers in the early 1970s whose ranks are predominantly Polynesian but not exclusive of others. Their reputed turf is reported to stretch from the Downtown area to Mangere and Papatoetoe. The Cobras also have a presence in the North Shore, and an established presence as far South as the Hutt Valley and the Wellington area. In 2009 it was reported that members of the gang had been involved in a multimillion dollar methamphetamine drug ring organised within Paremoremo Prison. The Cobras maintained a headquarters in Ponsonby up until August 2011 as they are reported to be shifting premises.
