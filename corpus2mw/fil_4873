The status of an honorary autonomous province was presented to ethnic Albanian communists who helped the Yugoslav partisans in their struggles during World War II, carved out from the section of the former Ottoman province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia (i.e. whilst one chunk of the former province was given to Albania in 1912, the other sections of it were awarded to Yugoslavia's newly created republics: Montenegro and Macedonia). The new party was given the task of running certain local affairs. In 1952, the party was renamed the "League of Communists of Kosovo".
