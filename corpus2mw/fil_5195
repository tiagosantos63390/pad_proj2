In the early 1940s de Tejada was captivated by works of Juan Vázquez de Mella, which brought him closer to Carlism and eventually produced his access to the technically illegal Comunión Tradicionalista. In 1950 the Carlist regent-claimant Don Javier appointed de Tejada to Consejo Nacional, the supreme executive body of the organisation re-established only 2 years earlier. Within the movement, largely suppressed by Franco and ridden with internal conflicts stemming from different political strategies and dynastical allegiances, de Tejada campaigned for Don Javier to terminate the regency and announce his personal claim to the throne. When this eventually happened in 1952, he was (together with Rafael Gambra and Melchor Ferrer) the co-author of "Acto de Barcelona", the proclamation issued by the pretender, and kept editing some of his later pronouncements. In 1954 he became the top Carlist pundit when published "La monarquía tradicional", the complete lecture of Traditionalist political theory.
