The concept of time and TVXQ's own tenth anniversary is referenced throughout "Tense", and the titles of TVXQ's older hit singles, starting from their debut single "Hug" (2004), are used in the lyrics for the album's opening track "Ten (10 Years)". A pop song with swing and big band influences, the album's lead single "Something" is intended to be a song with mass appeal. It is noted for being a major musical departure from TVXQ's earlier songs, which had heavy R&B, rock, and hip hop attributes. Continuing with the vintage theme set off from "Something", the album's third track "Your Man" is a retro pop punk song, and the dance pop song "Moonlight Fantasy" added gospel sounds for a more harmonious effect. The R&B pop number "Off-Road" is the Korean version of the English-language song "Runnin' On Empty", a song TVXQ recorded in 2011 for the film "Make Your Move 3D". U-Know Yunho also made a cameo appearance in the film, dancing to the song. Changmin wrote the lyrics for the ballad "Rise".

Top Ville started the 13/10 favourite in a field of eleven colts for the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly on 3 June. He was opposed by a straong field which included Sharpman and his reportedly superior stable companion Le Marmot as well as Bellypha and High Sierra, winner of the Prix Noailles. Top Ville demonstrated what Timeform described as "tremendous power" to take the lead in the straight and open up a decisive advantage before holding off the late run of Le Marmot to win by a length, with Sharpman five lengths back in third and Bellypha in fourth. For the second time in succession, Top Ville set a new race record, covering the 2400m distance in a time of 2:25.2.
