John also won four National Hurling League titles, the first one coming in 1952 when Tipperary beat New York in New York. His other successes came against Kilkenny in 1954, Wexford in 1955 and Kilkenny again in 1957. In the last of those he was described as having a magnificent game and was going as powerfully at the finish as at the start. He received the Sport Star of the Week accolade in the Irish Independent for his display. He played in the famous League final of 1956 when Wexford defeated Tipperary, who appeared to have an unassailable lead at half time, but lost it to a thundering, storm-assisted Wexford rally in the second half. He also lost a National Hurling League final with Tipperary in 1953 to Cork. As well as winning four Munster Finals with Tipperary in 1951, 1958, 1960 and 1961, John also lost three Munster Hurling Finals in 1952, 1953 and 1954, on each occasion to Cork.
