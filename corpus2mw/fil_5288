Michel Nédélec (7 March 1940 – 3 October 2009) was a French cyclist. He competed in the team pursuit at the 1960 Summer Olympics.
Cottell was an early adopter of computers for engineering design and a paper he wrote on their use was awarded a prize by the Institution of Municipal Engineers. He is regarded as one of the main contributors to the development of computer-aided design. Cottell developed an early highways design computer program, known as VALOR, in 1970 that was used by many local authorities in the UK. VALOR simplified the design of road widening and reconstruction schemes, drawing a number of closely spaced cross-sections which showed the proposed road levels and the survey information of the existing road. The program could optimise the design levels of the new road to minimise the cost of the project by utilising existing road make-ups. The implementation of VALOR was not entirely successful due partly to the limited processing power of the computers available to consulting engineers of the time.
