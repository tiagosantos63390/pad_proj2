Warnock then resumed the study of law and was admitted to the bar in 1866 and commenced practice in Urbana. He served as prosecuting attorney 1868-1872. Warnock also served as member of the board of school examiners of Champaign County 1870-1876. Along with his position as a trustee of Ohio Wesleyan University, which he held for twenty-five years, Warnock was also a member of the State senate in 1876 and 1877. Warnock also resided as the judge of the court of common pleas in the second district of Ohio from 1879 through 1889. Warnock was also the president of the National Bank of Urbana.
In July 1968, four UH-1F's and 10 pilots from the 20th Helicopter Squadron, "E" Flight, "Green Hornets," arrived from Nha Trang. The "new" Pony Express Hueys flew virtually all the same missions as the H-3's. There were a few of the H-3 missions in Northern Laos that the Hueys were not involved in due to the extreme distance and limited range of the UH-1. On occasion, the Huey would carry a 55 gallon barrel of fuel in the cabin. If the Huey required the extra fuel, the crewchief would hook up his safety strap, step out onto the chopper's skid and hold the refueling hose as the other crewman pumped the fuel into the Huey's fuel tank. This was done at cruising altitude.

Edwards later returned to Western Australia and settled at Gingin, where he died in 2000.

To create an AND-construction, we define a new family formula_30 of hash functions formula_33, where each function formula_33 is constructed from formula_35 random functions formula_36 from formula_1. We then say that for a hash function formula_38, formula_39 if and only if all formula_40 for formula_41. Since the members of formula_1 are independently chosen for any formula_38, formula_30 is a formula_45-sensitive family.
