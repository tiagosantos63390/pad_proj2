The Miyake moved the seat of their domain to Kameyama Domain in Ise Province in 1619, but returned to Koromo from 1636-1674. After 1674, they were finally allowed to return to their ancestral Tahara Domain. Koromo then became "tenry≈ç" territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate through appointed "daikan" administrators to 1688.

However, an account of the same journey written by Tonty in the summer of 1686 makes no mention of the fort, and can be interpreted to suggest that the fort he visited was actually at the mouth of the St. Joseph River on the east side of Lake Michigan. Further evidence that Durantaye's fort was not located beside the Chicago River comes from the journals of Henri Joutel. In October 1687 Joutel, and a party of LaSalle's men left Fort St. Louis bound for Canada, however, when they arrived at Lake Michigan poor weather prevented them from going any further. After waiting for eight days by the lake at the mouth of the Chicago River, they gave up and returned to Fort St. Louis. They set out again in March 1688, arriving at Chicago on March 29, and leaving on April 8. Joutel described their stay in Chicago, but made no mention of a fort.
