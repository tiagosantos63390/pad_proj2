Until 2008, the United States had officially considered Nelson Mandela a terrorist, however on the 5th of July 2008 Mandela along with as other ANC members including the then current foreign minister were removed from a US terrorist watchlist. Harry Schwarz, who served as South African Ambassador to the United States during its transition to representative democracy (1991–1994), has been credited as having played one of the leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations. Peter Fabricius described Schwarz as having "engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better than it has ever been”. The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti-apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system. During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President Bill Clinton, signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994.

In the "Mayday" episode "Crash of the century" Cubillo is indirectly held responsible for the deaths of 583 people who were killed in the "Tenerife Airport Disaster" on March 27, 1977. According to the documentary the planes that crashed (KLM 4805 and Pan Am 173) were diverted to Tenerife after Cubillo's terrorist bomb had exploded at their original destination (Gando Airport in Las Palmas). In his 10-minute telephone warning he had warned of the planting of two bombs, the second of which turned out to be a hoax. There were two key elements of the sequence of events that led to the disaster on the runway. The diversion was the reason the planes were in Tenerife and the delay whilst Gando was searched led to the fact that Tenerife was covered in fog by the time the planes were due to continue their journey.
