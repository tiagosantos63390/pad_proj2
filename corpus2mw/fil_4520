The hypothallus is produced by the plasmodium at the beginning of the fructification. Depending on the species, it can be membranous to thick or tender to solid and nearly transparent to radiant coloured. It is either shaped isolated as an edge of single fruit bodies or as a permanent layer, which connects the edges of numerous fruit bodies. In some but rarely cases it is missing entirely.
Today's church stands on a hilltop 114 meters above sea level which was also the site of an earlier, now demolished, Medieval church built in the Romanesque style. The old church was almost as long as the new building but only about half as wide. It appears to have been the only church on the island with star-shaped roof vaulting which probably replaced the original wooden ceiling around 1450. Many items of inventory from the old church can now be seen in the Bornholm Museum.
