Chiller officially announced plans to film an adaptation of "Deep in the Darkness" in mid 2013 and also announced that the movie would have a limited theatrical release before it went to VOD. The film starred Sean Patrick Thomas as Dr. Michael Cayle and Dean Stockwell as Phil Deighton, and featured a score by Matthew Llewellyn. The film officially released on April 29, 2014. "Shock Till You Drop" gave the movie a score of five out of ten, stating that while it had some effective jump scares and a good cast, they felt that the film was mostly unmemorable. The "New York Times" panned the film, expressing disappointment that the film did not live up to its full potential.
