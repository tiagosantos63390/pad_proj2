The year was 1944 and World War II was still aflame. After one year of foot soldiering in the States, I returned to work comsumed with the idea that I could wait no longer for a plaintiffs' lawyer organization to just happen and that it was up to me.

Synopsis.
Burka Avenger received mainly positive reviews and praise for it’s female empowerment themes. Time Magazine rated Burka Avenger as one of the most Influential Fictional Characters of 2013. In an article on Burka Avenger, Huffington Post stated that “Disney could learn a thing or two”. Washington Post elaborated on this, stating "Pakistan’s new superhero makes the hoop-skirted, Prince Charming-obsessed Disney princesses look downright antiquated. She was not born into royalty. She does not obsess about her beauty. And she definitely does not want or need to be whisked off on some white horse or magic carpet. No, Jiya, or the Burka Avenger, is too busy defending women’s rights and education for all. Now that’s what I call a role model for girls.”. CBC News put Burka Avenger's rave reviews down to “its colourful animation, pro-education message and cross-generational appeal", going on to state that "many are proudly referring to the character as Pakistan's Wonder Woman.”
