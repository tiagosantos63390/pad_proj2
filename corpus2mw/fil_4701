The Attention Seekers are originally a race who are accustomed to worship as deities on their home, which they feed on. They travel place to place and from time to time, masquerading as gods and being worshipped by countless societies until they "go out of fashion" there. Finding themselves in the comparatively more secular but vain 21st century Britain, Captain Jack explains to the narrator Peter that it has been forced to assume the form of a strikingly beautiful person who draws power from all the attention drawn to them. However, rather than copulate with one man every night, Jack ambiguously describes that the creature ends up in the car park where it can "get the serious devotion of a crowd", mentioning how it's "Odd how people still get on their knees to worship, isn't it?". Jack later explains though, that while it was originally relatively harmless in its activities, it has become increasingly hungry and thereby dangerous, so Jack is forced to kill it with a few clicks of his Time Agent Wrist-Strap, which he uses to trigger car alarms to clear the car park, and later a car explosion to kill the creature.
