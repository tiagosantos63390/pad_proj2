In 2007, Fuld batted .291 with a .371 on-base percentage, in 282 at-bats, as he began the season with the Tennessee Smokies in the Double-A Southern League. "He knows how to play the game, when to take a pitch, when to work the count, and when to go ahead and swing away and juice the ball", said his Tennessee manager, Listach. "He's strong enough that he can hit the ball out of the yard occasionally. He's a gap, line drive type hitter. He knows what type of hitter he is, and he doesn’t hit a lot of fly balls." He was an efficient leadoff batter for Tennessee, with more walks (41) than strikeouts (38)–a recurring theme in his career, as he was touted by "Baseball America" as having the best strike zone judgment in the organization. "He's a very intelligent player", added Listach. He continued: He plays the game the right way. He plays the game hard. He plays the game smart. He steals a base when you need a base stolen, not necessarily when it's 5–0 or a lopsided score. He does it when the team needs it. He makes the plays. He throws to the right bases. He's a left-handed hitter. He can run. He's a prototypical leadoff hitter in the big leagues... His work ethic is off the charts. Fuld was also touted by Listach as having the best outfield skills on the team, as he led the Southern League with 13 assists from the outfield. In August, Fuld was promoted to the Iowa Cubs in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. There, he batted .269, with a .397 on-base percentage.
