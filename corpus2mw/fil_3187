On ingestion by a female mite (male mites do not require blood) the gametocytes are released from the erythrocytes. Within the gut they associate in spindle like pairs and enter the epithelial cells of the gut. Within the epithelial cell the macrogametocyte increases in size while the microgametocyte shrinks. The microgametocyte divides in two and one of the motile gametes so formed fuses with the macrogametocyte to form a zygote.

Daoud Abdel Sayed is referred to one of the pioneers of a school of thought in Egyptian cinema called “New Realism”. According to Viola Shafik, professor at the American University in Cairo and author of Arab Cinema: history and cultural identity, New Realism appeared in the 1980s as a revival of the wave of realism that had dominated Egyptian cinema in the 1960s. The rise of the original realism in the 1950s called for filmmaking that reflected the daily life of the indigenous Egyptian population, paying attention to the choice of the “simple man” from the lower social class and portraying him as the protagonist. New Realism in turn, called essentially for the same thing but using different mechanisms of action and police film rather than melodrama.

Traditionally Tasmania's main industries have been: mining, including copper, zinc, tin, and iron; agriculture; forestry; and tourism. Significantly in the 1940s and 1950s there had been a Hydro-Industrialisation initiative embodied in the state by Hydro Tasmania. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time.

In the college's first academic year (2008-2009)it accommodated from the original school year ranges of both schools, 5-8. The next year the range increased by 1 to include a year 9 and the school took in a new year 5 (this was the College's final whole year intake until 2012). Each year until 2013 a new higher year was added to the College's age range. At the beginning of the college's academic year 2013-2014 it had reached its goal to become a full secondary school and sixth form. As the lowest year progressed to the consecutive years above them the lower years they had finished were removed from the college's range. It was unique in the United Kingdom in accommodating these age ranges, a reflection of its transformational status from middle to high school.

Aside from providing the "Monkey Island" license to Telltale, LucasArts' role in the game's development involved collaboration and approval of the game's script, character concept art and puzzle design. As the remake of "The Secret of Monkey Island" had begun development before "Tales of Monkey Island", LucasArts shared their art style guide with Telltale, so that the two products' art direction would be similar. In particular, LucasArts wished that the character of Guybrush would be comparable to the appearance of the character in the special edition. LucasArts largely based their vision for Guybrush's new visuals in "Tales of Monkey Island" on how the character appeared in "The Curse of Monkey Island", integrating various aspects from "LeChuck's Revenge" that commonly resonated through fan art, such as the character's blue coat and beard, in addition to using their own stylized art direction. Telltale concept artist Ryan Jones worked closely with LucasArts' Jeff Sengalli on developing the appearance of Guybrush and other characters, Sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes, facial features and clothing. Vanaman noted that LucasArts was open to Telltale's creative direction for the game, and did not "put their foot down" over any aspects of their vision.

He returns home and is surprised to find Jesse waiting for him in his apartment. She tearfully expresses her wish to be honest with him, but he decides to share his news with her first. He shows her his new novel, "Troy Meets Girl". It is revealed at this point that the relationship between Jesse and Troy was fictional; Troy had been created by Ethan as a more wealthy and successful version of himself for his novel. Jesse was not leaving with another man, but rather for a job in another city for a fresh start. Jesse then reveals her secret to Ethan—she cannot have children. Ethan quickly responds that this does not matter to him and that they can adopt if need be. He again proposes marriage and this time Jesse accepts.
