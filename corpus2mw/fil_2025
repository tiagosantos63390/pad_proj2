In the first edition of "Genera Palmarum" (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus "Cryosophila" in the subfamily Coryphoideae, the tribe Corypheae and the subtribe Thrinacinae Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Old World and New World members of the Thrinacinae were not closely related. As a consequence of this, "Cryosophila" and related genera were places in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. Within this tribe, "Cryosophila" appears to be most closely related to the genus "Schippia".

The town of Wickenburg contested that a direct routing between Phoenix and Kingman would be shorter than the routing through Ash Fork and that it would provide a necessary connection between Phoenix, the state capital, and the northwestern part of the state.

Marbled poison frog
Morelet's tree frogs are dying at a rapid rate. Their survival is dependent upon several factors due to their human and disease caused population decline. Some conservation measures are in place, while others are still in need of implementation or research. A number of protected parks have been created to curb habitat destruction in areas of Central America and Mexico. Taxonomic research is currently in place to further understand the population's status. More data is needed, however, on a temporal and spatial scale to determine trends in the population of Morelet's tree frogs.
