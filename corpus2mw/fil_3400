On 21 December 2011, Alvarado was sent off by Bas Nijhuis in a KNVB Cup match against Ajax after an Ajax supporter tried attacking him. A 19-year-old Ajax fan identified as Wesley van W had been drinking and entered the pitch after 36 minutes of play. He ran towards the AZ goalkeeper and attempted to kick him but slipped to the ground. Alvarado then kicked the attacker twice and was sent off for violent conduct. This prompted AZ manager Gertjan Verbeek to order his players to the dressing rooms in protest. The game was consequently abandoned. The KNVB subsequently rescinded the red card, and Ajax banned Wesley van W from all of their home matches for life. He was also sentenced to six months in prison, with two months suspended. He would also have to undergo treatment for an alcohol problem and report to police during all AZ, Ajax and Dutch national team matches for the following two years. The KNVB ordered the match replayed in its entirety behind closed doors. On 19 January 2012, the match was replayed with Alvarado in goal. AZ beat Ajax 3–2 to progress through the quarter final.
