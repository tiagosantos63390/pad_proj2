At 19, Crosby's manager/ex-girlfriend Sakina Sati took him to New York, along with ex-members Daniel Alva and Stephen Garver, for the purpose of shopping his demo tapes through Shiva Baum, former manager for Opiate for the Masses, and a bidding war broke out; he then signed with Elektra. Two albums were released by Elektra - "Visual Audio Sensory Theater" in 1998 and "Music For People" in 2000. In 2002, however, Crosby left the label. 2003 saw him break new ground when he released two digital download albums, "Turquoise 3.x" and "Crimson 3.x". He then moved on to Carson Daly's 456 Entertainment, where "Nude" was released in 2004.

Background.

Morphology and terminology.
Family structures of one married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century, influenced by church and theocratic governments. With the emergence of proto-industrialization and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit. The term "nuclear family" first appeared in the early twentieth century. Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by same-sex parents, and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role; in this latter case it also receives the name of conjugal family.
