In February 1972 "Taney" was shifted back to the east coast and was homeported at Norfolk. From 13 to October 22 of 1972 she served on "Ocean Station Hotel". From October 28 to November 17, 1972 she served on "Ocean Station Delta". From January 26 to February 15 and April 17 to May 7, 1973 she served on "Ocean Station Bravo". As the ocean stations were decommissioned during the early 1970s due to advances in radar and electronic navigation, "Taney" was assigned exclusively to the only station still operational: "Ocean Station Hotel" off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. Fitted with a special storm-tracking antenna housed in a distinctive bulbous dome fitted atop her pilot house, "Taney" deployed seven times yearly, conducting 21 deployments off the coast. This last ocean station had been established to track storms threatening the middle states on the east coast which had often struck without warning. Eventually, the use of more sophisticated storm-tracking satellites and radars rendered this station obsolete. Hence, "Ocean Station Hotel" was closed down in 1977 and the "Taney" gained the distinction of being the last Coast Guard cutter to serve on an ocean station.

Jonathan Lewis of Allmusic felt it showed them "as a talented young band, despite the flimsy songwriting and the lack of light and shade on the album". While Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it provides "a mature, complete range – from the early-penned punk mayhem of 'Blame' to the delicacy of the 'Twilight=Dusk', from the dark tones of 'Jerks of Attention' to the bright strains of radio hit 'Leaving Home'. The album does a great job of capturing the amazing live dynamic of the band".

Controversial in the Roman Catholic Church, the music was starkly rejected by Pope John XXII, but embraced by Pope Clement VI. The monophonic chant, already harmonized with simple organum, was becoming altered, fragmented, and hidden beneath secular tunes. The lyrics of love poems might be sung above sacred texts, or the sacred text might be placed within a familiar secular melody. It was not merely polyphony that offended the medieval ears, but the notion of secular music merging with the sacred and making its way into the liturgy.

A smooth curve is a curve "z" : ["a", "b"] → C with a non-vanishing, continuous derivative such that each point is traversed only once (z is one-to-one), with the possible exception of a curve such that the endpoints match ("z"("a") = "z"("b")). In the case where the endpoints match the curve is called closed, and the function is required to be one-to-one everywhere else and the derivative must be continuous at the identified point (formula_1). A smooth curve that is not closed is often referred to as a smooth arc.
