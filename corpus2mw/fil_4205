Evans was one of the best players to ever wear the Tricolour, and one of Queen's best quarterbacks. After his tragic accidental death in 1930, the University Football Team has presented an award, the "Johnny Evans Memorial Award for Most Valuable Player", to honour his memory. He has been enshrined in the "Queen's University Football Hall of Fame".
Activities.

Andrews (1835-1914) joined the firm in 1855, as a designer, immediately after completing his apprenticeship. The Cash brothers contracted him for three years, at annual salary of £100. In late 1857 he was offered managership of the Kingfield site, and took up residence at 8, Kingfield. He negotiated a salary of £120, with his house, gas and coal provided free. In addition, he was to be paid separately for his design work. He was not popular with the weavers, and left in June 1858 to manage another part of the business, at Drapers Fields.

But whereas, according to the Platonic philosophy, fallen souls still retain a remembrance of their lost home, this notion was preserved in another form in Gnostic circles. It was taught that the souls of the Pneumatici, having lost the remembrance of their heavenly derivation, required to become once more partakers of Gnosis, or knowledge of their own pneumatic essence, in order to make a return to the realm of light. In the impartation of this Gnosis consists the redemption brought and vouchsafed by Christ to pneumatic souls. But the various fortunes of such souls were wont to be contemplated in those of Sophia, and so it was taught that the Sophia also needed the redemption wrought by Christ, by whom she is delivered from her "agnoia" and her "pathe", and will, at the end of the world's development, be again brought back to her long lost home, the Upper Pleroma, into which this mother will find an entrance along with all pneumatic souls her children, and there, in the heavenly bridal chamber, celebrate the marriage feast of eternity.

Funds for party activity (be it campaigning or routine operations) can be solicited via "grassroots fundraising" as party membership dues or other voluntary contributions from individuals (e.g. direct mail fundraising) or as "plutocratic funding" from wealthy people and/ or the business community as corporate donations. Since the 1960s an additional source of political revenue, public subsidies, is spreading among the democracies. Despite such multitude of promising options political fundraising via political corruption (e.g. influence peddling, graft, extortion, kickbacks, embezzlement) is still around.


Leslie Street, which has four separate sections, begins at Lake Ontario at the foot of the Leslie Street Spit. Just north at Lake Shore Boulevard East was the former eastern terminus of the Gardiner Expressway. It continues north to the railway tracks north of Gerrard Street East, where the first segment ends. Donlands Avenue, which runs from the north side of the railway tracks to north of O'Connor Drive, was originally another segment of Leslie Street. The second segment is represented by a one-block stretch of road between Wicksteed Avenue and Vanderhoof Avenue in the Leaside Industrial land area. It is separated from the third segment by the Ernest Thompson Seton parklands.
