Shavenwhore is a Finnish death metal band originated in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1991.

In the cases of "Rush" and "The Bottom Line" this had the effect of condensing the songs into simpler pop song structures. "The Bottom Line" for example in its single edit did not feature the introductory 'Horses are on the track' section. The edit of "Rush" was not the UK edit (that was featured as the b-side to The Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go") which faded out briefly before the end of the original album version. The edit featured removes the entire 'Rhythm and Melody' breakdown.
