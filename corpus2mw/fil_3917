Yarington was the author of two tragedies, one of which tells of the murder of Mr Beech, a chaundler in Thames Street, and his boy, by Thomas Merry, the other of a young child murdered in a wood by two ruffians, with the consent of his uncle. They were printed for Matthew Law, and were sold at his shop in Paul's Churchyard near St. Augustines Gate at the sign of the Fox, 1601. Nothing has been discovered concerning Robert Yarington. In Henslow's Diary (ed. Collier, pp. 92–3) it is said Haughton and Day wrote a tragedy called ‘The Tragedy of Thomas Merry.’ This was clearly on the first subject of Yarington's play. The next entry in the Diary refers to ‘The Orphan's Tragedy’ by Chettle, which was apparently never finished. This would seem to be the second subject of Yarington's play.

Management of the system devices is handled by the Cisco UCS Manager software embedded into the 6100/6200 series Fabric Interconnect, which is accessed by the administrator through a common browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox, or a Command line interface like Windows PowerShell or programmatically through an API. Virtual machines can be moved from one physical chassis to another, applications may be moved between virtual machines, and management may even be conducted remotely from an iPhone using SiMU - Simple iPhone Management of UCS. In addition to the embedded software, administrators may also manage the system from VMware's vSphere.
