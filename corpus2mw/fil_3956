Black Rose are an English heavy metal band from Teesside in the north east of England. They formed in 1976 under the name ICE but changed it to Black Rose in 1980 and were one of many British bands considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. The original line up was Steve Bardsley (lead vocals/guitar), Kenny Nicholson (guitar), Marty Rajn (bass) and Mark Eason (drums). Over the next nine years the band went through various line up changes and released quite a few records including two albums: "Boys Will Be Boys" (1984) and "Walk It How You Talk It" (1986) before splitting up in 1989. The band then reformed in 2006 and released their newest album "Cure for Your Disease" in 2010.
