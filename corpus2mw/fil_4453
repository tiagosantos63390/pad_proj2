After being appointed to his position in Sault Ste. Marie, Schoolcraft requested the construction of a suitible building to house the agency. Schoolcraft designated a site, and plans were drawn up by Obed Wait, who had earlier designed Michigan's territorial capitol located in Detroit. Construction began in 1826 and was completed in 1827. The building, dubbed "Elmwood" due to the surrounding elms, was the headquarters for Indian affairs throughout the upper Great Lakes, as well as the home of the Schoolcrafts, from its construction until 1833, when the agency headquarters was relocated to Mackinac Island. The building was still used by the agency through the 1830s and 1840s.

Holstein Kiel won the championship and also won their promotion playoff, winning promotion to 3. Liga. Both VfB Lübeck and FC Oberneuland entered insolvency proceedings during the season; results involving these two teams were annulled. Kiel's promotion and the fact that no team was relegated from the 3. Liga meant that the number of relegated teams was reduced to just two. 
Ferraro and Johnny Fabulous also appeared for Powerhouse Wrestling during this time. In the spring of 2007, he wrestled "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka and Jake "The Snake" Roberts, losing both matches. That summer, Ferraro enjoyed a brief reunion with The Vachon Brothers in Ultimate Ring Wars Wrestling when he turned on his partner Crazy Chainsaw Bastard during a May 19 tag team match against The Vachons. He and Pierre Vachon faced each other in a special 4-man battle royal, with Paulie Gilmore and Kahuko, two months later in New World Wrestling. Ferraro eventually defeated CCB in a Casket match on September 15, 2007. Days later in Powerhouse Wrestling, a match between Ferraro and Abdullah the Butcher, involving broken bottles, a screw driver, a bed of nails, and Abdullah's infamous fork, ended in a no-contest.
The model fits well when the residuals (i.e., observed-expected) are close to 0, that is the closer the observed frequencies are to the expected frequencies the better the model fit. If the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is non-significant, then the model fits well (i.e., calculated expected frequencies are close to observed frequencies). If the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic is significant, then the model does not fit well (i.e., calculated expected frequencies are not close to observed frequencies).
