On 1 May 1916, Cardinal Bourne of Westminster learned of Berthe Petit's efforts to foster a conscration of the whole world to the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary; he received it favourably and promoted the devotion through pastoral letters dated 18 June 1916 and 3 September 1916. Early in 1917 he wrote a pastoral letter requesting all his clergy to make the cosecration on the first Sunday in Lent; on 30 March, the Friday before Palm Sunday, "all the churches in Britain" held a solemn act of consecration. Cardinal Bourne responded to a specific request from Berthe that he should repeat the act of consecration on Christmas Day 1917, and in the light of British losses in the battle (following unexpected gains in late 1917), he made a third such act on Good Friday 1918. A fourth act, in thanksgiving for the conclusion of the conflict, was made by the Cardinal, at Bethe's behest, on 24 May 1919.
