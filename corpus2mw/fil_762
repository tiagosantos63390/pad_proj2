The narrator receives a cable that he had won an award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters of $5,000. He shares it with Ricki, John, and Jake Vickers. John insists that he find a way to spend it and earn more rather than let it rot. Then John brings up homosexuality, but unlike John and Jake the narrator has nothing to share on the topic. The subject returns to the prize money, and the narrator continues to refuse to go spend the money, and the two other men call him a coward. This takes a way the meaning from the prize and the money, and the narrator announces that he will bet all of the money at a horse race. Ricki had been quietly encouraging him through all of this, and they go out to the porch, where she reads him the letter again and the meaning returns. Nothing more is said of the prize or the money.
