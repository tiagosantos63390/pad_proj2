Round 3 was the Lightning Round. One player from each team stepped up to the microphone to answer the question. They signaled using a whistle around their neck. A right answer was worth $100 and forced the opponents to take off an article of clothing. A wrong answer, however, gave the opponents $100, and the answering team had to take off a piece of clothing. (By this point, it was normal for one team to be so far ahead that one of their opponents would already be answering questions in their boxers/bra and panties.) If neither player answered, they would both have to take off an article of clothing.
