At the time of AMC's buyout, Chrysler was designing the replacement for the then-new Dodge Dynasty, a mid-size car. The proposed replacement bore a direct resemblance to the existing Dynasty. However, with the purchase of AMC, a new product design system was instituted and work began by using AMC's Eagle Premier platform. According to Robert Lutz, the in-house design was scrapped entirely and the new design, under Castaing's leadership, was selected. The Chrysler LH-cars were first to use Castaing's platform approach.

The Eagle Vision, Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, LHS and New Yorker were all produced in AMC's state of the art Brampton Assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario, Canada that was built to make the Eagle Premier.

Because of declining enrollment, two of the schools closed in 1979. Despite Whittier High School being the oldest high school in the district, with the oldest buildings (many in a desperate need of major repairs), the two newest schools in the district were closed at the direction of a school board that was composed solely of graduates of Whittier High School. Many students from the Sierra High School area came to Whittier. Since that time, Whittier High School's enrollment has slowly increased each year.
