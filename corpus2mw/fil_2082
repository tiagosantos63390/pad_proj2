Stunned, Wolverine tries to calm her down as her powers begin to destroy the hospital wing around them, Jean unable to control her impulses. She tearfully begs Logan to kill her before she kills another person. Logan refuses, reassuring her that she'll be alright if she lets Charles help her. But the Phoenix, enraged, blasts Wolverine into the wall hard enough to break the wall and exits the room, disintegrating and blasting the heavy metal doors out of her way. When Xavier and Storm find Wolverine, he tells them that Cyclops is dead, which shocks Storm but seems to confirm Xavier's fears. Despite Phoenix trying to block him out, Xavier manages to locate her. Meanwhile, one of Magneto's new followers who can sense mutant powers tells Magneto that a Class 5 mutant, more powerful than anything ever sensed, has come into being. Understanding immediately, Magneto demands to know where she is.

He later served four months in jail for drunkenness. The experience led him in 1837 to take on prison reform with his "The Rat-Trap; or Cogitations of a Convict in the House of Correction".

At the start of X-Men, a preteen Magneto was separated from his parents by Nazi soldiers in a concentration camp, and it was during this moment that his powers begin to manifest (twisting open a metal fence separating him and his parents). In the present time, Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use her as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Robert Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor that does he care. In the end, he is incapacitated by Cyclops after being distracted by Wolverine and locked up in a plastic prison.
