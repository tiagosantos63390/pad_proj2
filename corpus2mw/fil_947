Situated on the Saint John River opposite Fort Kent, Maine. The name Clair finds its roots in the community named for County Clare in Ireland. The name of the village is the result of the railroad station being located near the General store of James T. Clair. The station was called Clair's and was a regular stop of the Temiscouata Railway on its way up to the Connors station. Over time, the name stuck and was shortened to the family name of Clair. The original name of the location was actually "La Petite DÃ©charge" named after the discharge of the small "ruisseau des Lang" into the Saint John River.
