By 2008, he was wrestling for both NAWA Ring Champions, for which he served as booker at times, and Southern Extreme Championship Wrestling. On January 6, 2008, at SECW's "Bill Dromo Appreciation Night" in Carrollton, he wrestled in a 6-man tag team match with Chick Donovan and Bulldog Raines against Bob Armstrong, Tommy Rich, and Buff Bagwell, losing when his team was disqualified. On February 7, a tag team match with Bulldog Raines against Tommy Rich and Jimmy Powell in Rome for NAWA Ring Champions ended in a double-disqualification. He and Raines lost a match in SECW against Bull Buchanan and Buff Bagwell three days later.

Injection of pure dortoxin in mice leads to hyperactivity, tremors, convulsions, profuse salivation, lacrymation, continuous urination and vocalizations. The toxin has a rapid onset. The last period of hyperactivity is more intense and leads to death, after which postmortem twitching occurs for at least 30 seconds. The toxin is lethal at 200Â ng of peptide in a 20 g mouse.
Since water movements are difficult for humans to observe, researchers can visualize the hydrodynamic stimuli that animals detect via particle image velocimetry (PIV). This technique tracks fluid motions by particles put into the water that can be more easily imaged compared to the water itself. The direction and speed of water movement can be defined quantitatively. This technique assumes that the particles will follow the flow of the water.
