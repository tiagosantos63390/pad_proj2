Detroit, according to "Football Outsiders", had "a bit of an odd schedule; on the surface, it doesn't look like Detroit's schedule of opposing run defenses was that easy. The Lions missed the Eagles, but they did have to play six games against the teams ranked sixth through ninth in run defense [efficiency: San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, and Green Bay. Except running back Barry Sanders didn't play against Washington in Week 1, and he had only seven carries against San Francisco in Week 8. His two highest-carry games came against the two worst run defenses in the league, Miami and Indianapolis."
The National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens lists 8 hectares of the grounds at grade II. The park includes a lake.
Crops are raised throughout the year, with hardy greens spending the winter months in unheated greenhouses. The harvest is sold at CitySeed’s Wooster Square Farmers’ Market. The Union League, one of New Haven’s most highly regarded restaurants, regularly features produce from the Farm. In an urban area like New Haven, that’s as locally grown as it gets.

The Hastings Foundry-Star Iron Works is a historic foundry building in Hastings, Minnesota, United States. Located at 707 First Street East, it was built by A. R. Morrell, an ironsmith from Vermont, in 1859. The building is historically significant as the location where the first steam engine in Minnesota was built (1860). In 1861 the engine for the "Stella Whipple" was manufactured there as well. Iron for bridges and engines for railroad elevators, automobiles, and river boats were manufactured in this earliest surviving industrial site in the state.
