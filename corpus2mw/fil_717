Dathomir is the planet located in the Dathomir system. The planet is covered in lush swamps and small trees. It is inhabited by wild rancors, as well as by Force-sensitive "witches", divided into two groups. There are various light-following clans over the entire planet, foremost of which is the Singing Mountain Clan. There are also the Nightsisters, who follow the dark side. These groups are descendants of a Jedi master banished to the planet. Dathomir was first introduced in the 1995 book "The Courtship of Princess Leia". It is thought that this planet is the home planet of the rancor. The terrain of the planet is mostly made up of canyons, forests and jagged mountain peaks. Dathomir is home to an imperial prison.
