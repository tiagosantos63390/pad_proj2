Most pottery found at the Parkin Site is of the kind known as Mississippian Plain "var. Neeleys Ferry" and Barton Incised "var. Togo" (formerly called Parkin Punctated). Pottery found at Parkin phase sites are usually utilitarian wares rather than the elaborate mortuary types found at the Nodena, Kent or Walls phase burials. The archaeologist Clarence Bloomfield Moore described pottery from St. Francis River sites with adjectives such as "lopsided", "insufficiently fired", "rude and scanty", of "inferior surface" and "great monotony". In fact elaborate effigy pottery were also found at these sites, including five human head effigy pots, underwater panther effigies, elaborate fish and dog effigies, and red and white spiral, swastika and stripped bottles. The inclusion of less specifically mortuary wares found in graves seems to be a cultural difference between the Parkin peoples and the peoples of the surrounding phases.

LEC billing is permitted in the United States as the breakup of the Bell System forced local telcos out of the long distance business; each client would otherwise receive multiple monthly bills (one for local service, one for long distance). There is no LEC billing for alternate long distance carriers in Canada as Bell Canada and Telus remain in the long-distance business and do not collect on behalf of their competitors.

In 1956, Comiskey became co-general manager along with his brother-in-law Johnny Rigney, replacing Frank Lane. His mother died later that year, and in her will control of the team was split between Comiskey and his older sister, Dorothy. Comiskey received a 46 percent stake, making him the team's second largest shareholder. However, he felt the team was his birthright and spent the next two years trying to wrest control of the team from his sister. After a lengthy court battle, Dorothy opted to sell the team to Comiskey after the 1958 season. Believing that Dorothy wouldn't consider any offers from outside the family, Comiskey made a fairly low offer. Dorothy, in a fit of pique, instead sold her 54 percent stake to a group headed by Bill Veeck. However, Comiskey refused to sell his interest and remained as the team's largest single shareholder. This forced Veeck to incur over a million dollars in additional taxes.
