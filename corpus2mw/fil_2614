Ten years after the events of "Star Strike", humans have located the homeworld of the Xul, deep within the Galactic Center. The 1MIEF wants to destroy the system, but misguided politics on Earth no longer support the war against the Xul and attempt to shut the mission down. Eventually a compromise is reached with a peace mission going along with the 1MIEF.

The peace mission fails and the Marine forces cause a star to go off course toward the black hole destroying the Xul's dyson sphere.
