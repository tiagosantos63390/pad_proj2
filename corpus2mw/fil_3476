"Ignomínia" is a short but powerful poem that has a tragic and profound tone. It speaks of the atrocities committed against the innocent people of Rwanda while the rest of the world remained silent and took no action to protect them. It severely criticizes the governments of the industrialized nations for allowing the genocide to take place in Rwanda. The poem ends with this disturbing verse: "Ruanda ainda conta os crânios dos seus filhos" (Rwanda still counts the skulls of her children).

The greatest "verista" novelist, Giovanni Verga, was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.

Lindemann moved to Illinois and was principal clarinetist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for 26 years, from 1923 to 1949. He was replaced by Mitchell Lurie after he retired in 1949. He also played in the Chicago Woodwind Quintet during the 1930s. Lindemann used German (Oehler system) clarinets with custom-made mouthpieces. He taught clarinet privately after his retirement from the orchestra; author and teacher Keith Stein was one of his students. Unlike most prominent clarinet teachers of the time, he did not produce his own instrumental method book. He died in Everett, Washington in October 1975, at age 91.
The Linux laptop it is designed for, with its 400 MHz MIPS CPU usually underclocked by the manufacturer to as little as 366 MHz, is not fast. Web browsing (depending on the web browser used) can be slow because of the small screen size and lack of processing power and so the 3MX operating system has to work within these constraints but does remarkably well providing the user with a decent mini laptop environment.
