On January 29, 2008 the company agreed to acquire Quintana Maritime for US$ 764 million in cash and 23.5 million common shares for a total of US$ 1.44 billion. With the acquisition, the company more than doubled the number of vessels it owns, acquiring 5 Capesize, 14 Kamsarmax and 11 Panamax carriers. In addition, it inherited newbuilding contracts for 7 Capesize vessels with estimated delivery in 2010. As of October 2009, the company expects to take delivery of only 2 of these and will share 50% ownership with external parties on one of them. No deposits were forfeited for the 5 vessels not delivered. Following the acquisition, 14 of the company's Kamsarmax vessels and 3 Panamax vessels were placed on time charters to Bunge. Along with the acquisition, the company entered into a US$ 1 billion term loan and a US$ 400 million revolving loan at LIBOR + 1.25% (hedged with swap agreements at ~5%) which allowed it to refinance most of its loans.
