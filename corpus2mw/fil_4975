Before "A Thousand Suns" in 2010, a demo version for "Robot Boy" is featured on this compilation album, just before the final version of the song is featured and recorded on "A Thousand Suns" itself. The demo version on the album contains different lyrics from the album version, entitled as "Robot Boy (Test Mix, Optional Vocal Take)", and everything had changed, due to the test mix of Robot Boy. The ending to the demo is different from the final version of "Robot Boy", cutting off the long note, which leads the track listing to the short song "Jornada del Muerto" (also on "A Thousand Suns"). The demo version and its final version for "A Thousand Suns" has no working title.
For flexibility, commercial off-the-shelf parts and system-wide "radiation-tolerant" design are used instead of rad-hardened parts.
The battle of Hastings was not the end of the fighting, William's army had to suppress many rebellions to secure the kingdom. As a result of the unrest, some English nobles had sought sanctuary, in Scotland, at the court of Malcolm III. One of these was Edgar Ã†theling, a member of the house of Wessex and thus the last English claimant to the throne of England.
