The release of oxytocin can result in a female's sexual arousal, with a resulting physiological response, including the erection of the nipples. A nipple erection is due to the contraction of smooth muscle under the control of the autonomic nervous system and is a product of the pilomotor reflex which causes goose bumps. Nipple erection can also be caused by a mild tactile stimulation or as a response to cold temperature in both males and females. Nipple erection may also result during sexual arousal in females and males, or during breastfeeding. Both are caused by the release of oxytocin. An erection of the nipples makes them even more sensitive to the touch. Some women can achieve an orgasm as a result of nipple stimulation. A survey in 2006 has found that sexual arousal in about 82% of young females and 52% of young males arises or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples, with only 7â€“8% reporting that it decreased their arousal. A 2011 study using magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the area of the sensory cortex in a woman's brain associated with the genitals, is aroused by stimulating her nipples. The same brain areas connected to genitals were aroused as well in men who stimulated their nipples.
