"Let's Get Back to Bed â€“ Boy!" is a song by German recording artist Sarah Connor. Written and produced by frequent collaborative duo Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, it features American performer TQ. Conceived for Connor's debut album, "Green Eyed Soul" (2001), the midtempo contemporary R&B track is built around a mandoline sample and scratching hip hop beats, over which Connor, as the female protagonist, adopts sensual vocals and expresses her desire to make love with her man, inviting him to her bed.
