In August 2009, they decided on a more professional approach for their first official EP. It took two days to record "I, Boheme" in the Dutch Sahara Sound Studio in The Hague, where they worked with Henk Koorn (Hallo Venray). A music video for track "Insomnia" was shot soon after and both the video and the EP were released on November 5 in Supermarkt, The Hague. The EP was spotted by the Dutch pop magazine "LiveXS" and subsequently The Bohemes were chosen as Local Heroes of the January/February issue.
Certainly a row at the time, but one that Evans later realised played a part in leading to his second marriage, this connected him with another bizarrerie. In all innocence he erected his usual Peter Evans Eating Houses sign over a new restaurant at the junction of Kensington High Street and Kensington Church Street [https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rollthedice/3390273363/]. The Eating House was bang next door to a church and the David Hicks's stylised PEEH fork was pointing directly at it. The Church elders were not amused. 'Definitely not Good Evans â€“ His Devil's Fork Threatens The Church' summed up newspaper headlines around the world.
