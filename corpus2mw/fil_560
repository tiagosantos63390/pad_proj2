In 1951 he founded the seminal International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA) to provide a forum for discussion on design, “where the human spirit can flourish”. The primary IDCA objective was to connect culture with commerce by inviting both international business and industry leaders together with representatives from various commercial design fields such as industrial design, graphic design and architecture, as well as those in the fine arts and fields such as psychology, filmmaking and literature. The annual conference format included keynote speakers, workshops, panel discussions and informal, social gatherings. These activities naturally integrated those from commerce and culture into settings that stimulated dialogue, debate and insights. The existence of IDCA established a key collaborative forum on the topic on managing design within corporations for the benefit of society, as well as adding value to business. IDCA was held every June in Aspen from 1951 to 2004.
This site yields some of the earliest evidence anywhere for the Roman use of water-powered trip hammers to crush ore (Burnham 1997). The ore was probably crushed on the famous Carreg Pumsaint, a block of stone erected many years ago before the Romans had left the site. There are parallels with similar stones at other ancient Roman mines in Europe, and the hollows in the block were formed by a trip hammer probably worked by a water wheel or a "water lever". Such a water-powered hammer would have been moved regularly as each hollow became too deep, so producing the series of overlapping oval hollows in its surfaces. The hammer head must have been of substantial size judging by the width of the hollows shown in the drawing. The stone is the only example so far discovered at the site, but is not unique, and Burnham refers to others of similar shape from Spain. As one side of the stone became worn, it was simply turned to reveal another side, so the block could be re-used several times. When found years after the Romans had left, in the Dark Ages, it gave rise to the legend of the five saints, who left the impression of their heads in the stone after being found asleep by the devil.

The initial reaction (1) consumes sodium hydroxide and produces both hydrogen gas and an aluminate byproduct. Upon reaching its saturation limit, the aluminate compound decomposes (2) into sodium hydroxide and a crystalline precipitate of aluminum hydroxide. This process is similar to the reactions inside an aluminium battery.

On February 7, 1911, King married Delia Drew, also from Tomah. They were both 28 years old and moved into a series of apartments on the South Side of Chicago. Delia gave birth to a stillborn daughter in 1912, and in 1916, a son, Robert Drew King, was born.

Two versions of the video were made—the original and the Hex Hector Remix Version—directed by Francis Lawrence. In the original, the video begins with the sun setting, while Lopez and her friends are preparing for a New Year's Eve party. Intercut are scenes of Lopez in the jungle, dancing with green lasers flashing behind her and with sparkling crystals covering her body. The females are on a canoe over a river, travelling to a party which is being held in the middle of a jungle area. After the end of the Bridge of the song, the music cuts off, and the party is waiting for the clock to count down to the year 2000. There is a 6-second power outage (referring to the then-Y2K problem), until the power is back on, and the beginning of the new year is celebrated with the party dancing. There is inter-cut scenes of Lopez dancing on top of the crowd and playing in the water wearing a black bikini. In the Hex Hector Remix version, the video intercuts new scenes of Lopez dancing in a jungle with green lasers flashing behind her with the original footage. The video also incorporates a green laser strobe effect.

Therefore, in the summer of 1917, Lieutenant G.R. Rackham was ordered to design an armoured vehicle specifically for troop transport. The early design process was complicated by a demand that the vehicle could also be fitted with sponsons, converting it into a more modern tank than the Mark V, in case the Mark VIII tank design proved a failure. This is why the type was still designated as a tank, a "Mark IX" succeeding the Mark VIII. That requirement was soon dropped, and in September 1917 Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. in Newcastle-upon-Tyne began constructing two prototypes of a pure transport vehicle, which could also serve as a supply tank. The prototypes were approved the following year. At the time it had become clear that a possible alternative, the stretched Mark V* tank, was not really suited for infantry transport. Therefore two hundred vehicles were ordered of the Mark IX, to be built by the tractor manufacturer Marshall, Sons & Co. of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.
