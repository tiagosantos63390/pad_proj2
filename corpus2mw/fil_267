The club were established in 1877 as Downs Football Club and were initially based in Downs Road in Hackney. They originally played in dark blue shirts and white shorts with a distinctive white Maltese cross on the left breast of the shirt. The following year the club adopted its current name. They initially played on Hackney Downs, with its headquarters at the Downs Hotel. In 1880 they moved to a pitch adjacent to Lea Bridge Road in Leyton, but moved on again shortly afterwards to a ground at Elm Farm. In 1888 the club moved to the Old Spotted Dog after it was vacated by St Bartholomew's Hospital. The first game at the new ground was watched by over 4,000 spectators and saw the club beat Old Carthusians 1–0.

Welsh metalcore band Bullet for My Valentine's second album, "Scream Aim Fire", went straight to number 4 on the "Billboard" 200, later surpassing this in 2010 with their third album "Fever", which debuted at number 3 selling more than 71,000 copies in its first week in the U.S. and more than 21,000 in the UK. Underoath's fifth album "Define the Great Line", released in 2006, peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 98,000 copies in its first week.
If there were no mortality in the female population until the end of the childbearing years (generally taken as 44, 45, or 49, though some exceptions exist) then the replacement level of TFR would be very close to 2.0. The replacement fertility rate is roughly 2.1 births per woman for most industrialized countries (2.075 in the UK, for example), but ranges from 2.5 to 3.3 in developing countries because of higher mortality rates. Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement is 2.33 children per woman. At this rate, global population growth would tend towards zero.

Honest Ed's is prominently located on the corner of Bloor and Bathurst Streets, running the whole length of the block. The exterior is covered with huge red and yellow signs advertising the name of the store, lit up like a theatre marquee. The store sign uses 23,000 light bulbs. The store consists of two buildings connected by a walkway that links up the west building on Markham Street and the east building on Bathurst Street. The interior is much more modest, with simple displays of low-priced merchandise, ranging from vacuum cleaners and winter coats to kitchenware, toys and grocery items. Much of the store's decor consists of posters and photos from old films and stage productions from Mirvish's theatres in Toronto and London, England, as well as of actors and musicians who performed in them (many of these inscribed to Ed Mirvish himself). Every piece of store signage is hand-painted. The outside facade is covered with puns and slogans such as "Come in and get lost!" and "Only the floors are crooked!"
It was also released on DVD on 21 September 2009. Although the story was previously thought of as complete, it was discovered during remastering for the DVD release that episodes two and four were slightly edited from the originally broadcast versions; these cuts were reinstated using off-air audio recordings and other visual material.
Documented running through the canyon started in 1990. A group of hikers in running gear attempted to complete the 5 day, 90 kilometer hiking trail in 24 hours.
London's Peter de la Roche is believed to be one of the first 'operators for the teeth', men who advertised themselves as specialists in dental work. They were often professional goldsmiths, ivory turners or students of barber-surgeons. US President George Washington is famously known for his dentures, which were made with ivory from hippos and elephants as well as gold, rivets, spiral springs and even real human teeth. 
In his first public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his presidency would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of "purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime (...), particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain unjust enrichment, a rush that is poisoning society, preventing the state from ensuring elementary social security, health security, basic conditions for the development of the family the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.
The constitutional status of Finland was not codified in Russian law before the February Manifesto of 1899, by which time Finns and Russians had developed quite different ideas about the status of Finland. The autonomy of Finland was at first encouraged by the Russians in part due to the relatively developed governmental structures in Finland (as compared to the emperor-centered Russia of early 19th century) and in part as a deliberate policy of goodwill to win over the minds of the Finnish people. The autonomous status led Finns to develop their own ideas of nationalism and constitutional monarchy, which they could to a large extent implement in practice with the assent of the Tsar. However, while each tsar at the time of his coronation did agree to uphold the special status of the local laws in Finland, there is no evidence that they understood their position as one of a constitutional monarch, despite the growing prevalence of such an interpretation in Finland in the latter part of the 19th century. As governmental organizations developed in Russia, and unity of the empire became one of the leading tenets of Russian politics, clashes between the Russian and Finnish governmental organizations grew frequent and led to the attempted russification.
Linus is considered Charlie Brown's best friend. Linus is sympathetic towards Charlie Brown, and often gives him advice after listening to Charlie Brown's various insecurities. Similarly, Charlie Brown manages to generally overlook Linus's faults, such as his undying faith in the Great Pumpkin, his dependence on his security blanket, or any of his other odd quirks. They are also forced together in allegiance over a common enemy: Lucy, who harasses and bullies Charlie Brown as much as she does Linus. The two are often seen having discussions while sitting on a street curb or leaning up against the brick wall. At some point in the strip, Linus begins to appear sitting behind Charlie Brown in school, despite being a year younger than Charlie Brown. It is possible that Linus skipped a grade due to his unusual intelligence.
Weber State University was founded by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Weber Stake Academy in 1889; like Weber County and the Weber River, the school was named after John Henry Weber, an early fur trader. The university first opened its doors for students on 7 January 1889 when ninety-eight students enrolled for classes. The first principal of Weber Stake Academy was Louis F. Moench. He served from 1889–1892 and again from 1894-1902. In the latter year Moench was succeeded as principal by David O. McKay who served in that position until 1908. From 1914-1917 James L. Barker was the principal of the Weber Stake Academy.
Various actors have voiced the animated Rerun since 1976, including Vinny Dow, Jason Mendelson, Timmy Deters, and Jimmy Bennett.
Although most scholars agree that the Social Gospel movement peaked in the early 20th century, there is disagreement over when the movement began to decline, with some asserting that the destruction and trauma caused by World War I left many disillusioned with the Social Gospel's ideals while others argue that World War I stimulated the Social Gospelers' reform efforts. Theories regarding the decline of the Social Gospel after World War I often cite the rise of neo-orthodoxy as a contributing factor in the movement's decline. Many of the Social Gospel's ideas reappeared in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. "Social Gospel" principles continue to inspire newer movements such as Christians Against Poverty.
