A handsomely sculptured alter-tomb formerly occupied the centre of this chapel, which is now found built into the walls of the vault that surrounds the Bermingham tomb, erected in 1815 by a Frederick Hamilton. The effigy on the original tomb is now placed in an upright position within the chapel. It represents a knight in a suit of plate armour, with a crucifix on the breast attached around the neck by a chain. The effigy is more than likely dedicated to Sir William Bermingham.
The lake is a popular fishing spot partly because it is close to the St. Regis River which is stocked with over 10,000 trout each year. The lake itself harbors different species of trout including Rainbows and Browns with other fish species like perch. It can be fished year-round and there is a DEC boat launch located along the shore. The lake may only be accessed by a non-motorized boat or a motorized boat with a 10 horsepower or less engine.

Gaelic football has always been seen as the weaker of the two sports in Cork. The game is strongest in the west of the county and in Cork city. Success, especially at senior level, has been much more sporadic that with hurling. The biggest hindrance to success has been the presence of next door neighbors Kerry. Cork has been the second strongest county in Munster since the 1940s and often one of the best in the country. Many very good Cork teams were unable to overcome Kerry when they met in the Munster final. Cork began the 1970s with three Munster titles in 4 years and the 1973 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. But they then ran up against the great Kerry team of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, the two teams drew in the final of the Munster Senior Football Championship. The replay went to extra-time, before two very controversial refereeing decisions saw Kerry victorious. Cork fell back after that for a number of years.
