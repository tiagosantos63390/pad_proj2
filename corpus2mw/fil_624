At one time, there was a question over whether this requirement actually applied at the motion to dismiss stage. The statute says the plaintiff must "prove" loss causation. It does not say the plaintiff must "allege" loss causation. However, after the Supreme Court's decision in "Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo", it is now clear that a plaintiff must allege loss causation in its complaint.
