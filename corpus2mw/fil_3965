Notes:
Juan García de Miranda was born of Asturian parents at Madrid, and studied painting under Juan Delgado, producing chiefly devotional pictures, particularly "Immaculate Conception"s, for private patrons. Born without a right hand, he made use of the stump of the arm to hold pencils, maulstick, &c. He was appointed to clean and restore the pictures injured in the fire at the Alcazar, and acquitted himself so well as to be appointed, in 1735, painter-in-ordinary to Philip V. He also held, with Palomino, from 1724, the post of public valuer of pictures. He died in 1749, leaving a son Juan, of great promise as a painter, who, however, died at the age of twenty-one. His brother and disciple, Nicolas Garcia de Miranda, who was born in 1698, and died in 1738, painted landscapes with religious figures.

After the scare of 1457, when French troops successfully attacked the town of Sandwich on the south coast, Southampton Castle was once again put on alert, and one of Henry VI's more "dependable captains", Nicholas Carew, was given control of the castle for life. Despite investment in the castle declining, the antiquarian John Leland could describe the new keep in the early 16th century as being "the glory of the castle, both large and fair and very strong, both by works and by the site of it".
On 24 March, the Civil Bloc, an umbrella group of civil society organisations, called for a transitional council of nine figures "not involved with the corruption of the old regime" to draw up a new constitution over a six-month period ahead of elections.

The Lords of the Manor were influential figures in medieval and early modern Worcestershire, with a number becoming High Sheriffs or Members of Parliament for Worcestershire. A few were also national figures, especially the Talbots and Earls of Shrewsbury. Grafton was connected with Catholic worship in the County after the Reformation. 
Constantine himself was first exiled to an island in the Sea of Marmara, but later, to prevent his escape, he was transferred to a tower in the Walls of Constantinople, along with Constantine Doukas. His military expertise, however, continued to be so valued that the Orphanotrophos considered sending him as a military advisor to his brother Constantine in a campaign against Abasgia. A later tradition has it that during Constantine's detainment in the capital, Zoe, who had yet to conceive a child, carried out a secret relationship with him in hopes of getting pregnant. At some point in 1041, Constantine was also forced to become a monk. The accounts here are contradictory: Psellos writes that Michael V did this upon his accession in December, but Michael Attaleiates in contrast records that Michael V had Dalassenos liberated from confinement.
