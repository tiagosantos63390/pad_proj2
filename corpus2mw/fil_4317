In 1914 during World War I, Selivanov was appointed commander of the forces besieging Przemyśl. The siege had begun under the command of Radko Dimitriev on September 24, 1914. Dimitriev's Russian Third Army was forced to suspend siege operations during Paul von Hindenberg's offensive against Warsaw in 1914. After defeat at the battle of the Vistula River, Hindenberg and his Austrian allies retreated and Dimitriev resumed siege operations. However the Third Army was moved away from the Przemyśl front. General Selivanov then assumed command of the Russian siege forces which were designated the Russian Eleventh Army. Selivanov halted the frontal assaults which had characterized earlier Russian attempts to subdue the fortress. Selivanov settled into starving the garrison into submission. Defeat became inevitable for the defenders when Austrian relief efforts were turned back and Selivanov's Eleventh Army overran Przemyśl's northern defenses. For successfully capturing Przemyśl, Selivanov was awarded the Order of Saint George, 3rd Degree.
