The Quays have characterized the film as a parallel universe of the novel. The film sometimes makes figurative aspects of the novel into literal objects in the film. One reoccurring theme in the film is that many objects are seen vibrating, such as forks or bells. Parallels have been drawn between these vibrations and the frequent theme of music in Walser's writing. Also, in one passage of the book Jakob describes a staff member at the school as like a monkey, but in the film a literal monkey takes the role of that staff member. In addition, while Jakob wonders about the activities of Herr and Lisa Benjamenta in the novel, the film clearly displays an incestuous relationship. The conclusion of the film, however, differs from the book in a different manner. It shows Herr and Jakob's departure from the institute in surreal scene of the two in a fish bowl rather than Jakob's literal journey back to town in the book.

In 1921, a boiler room was added at the back of the building and a bathroom installed. Bucket lavatories (situated by staircases and emptied daily) were still in use, however, and whilst education was now an option, children had to make the majority of their uniforms themselves. Conditions did improve during the 1920s though, to the extent that by 1930, the building was little more than a hospital caring for sick townspeople, mainly the elderly. Subsequently, the workhouse closed and fell into dereliction. Nearby Coates school used part of the building between June 1937 and April 1938 whilst their own was extended and renovated to cope with overcrowding.
