Vettel pitted for his second stop on lap 39 and was clearly pushing very hard, running over a kerb on his out lap and damaging the underside of his car, having already lost his right wing mirror. However, worse was to come, as on lap 40 the stewards handed him a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. This left Hamilton 9.2 seconds ahead of Glock, who was in turn 7.6 seconds ahead of Alonso as Vettel served his penalty on lap 43. Red Bull's afternoon went from bad to worse three laps later as Webber spun out at Turn 1 after a right-front brake failure.
Winter's general conclusion was that Jesus was tried, and ultimately convicted and crucified, solely for his having violated Roman Law, sedition, because he claimed to be the king of the Jews, despite Rome's having appointed the Herodian family to that post. Crucifixion was solely a Roman form of execution, for sedition and other serious violations of Roman Law. Jewish Law did not employ crucifixion, not even for crimes which were capital offenses under Jewish Law.
