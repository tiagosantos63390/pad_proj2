Their split LP with Void remains one of the best hardcore records of all time. As well as their more catchy but still raging EP "Subject to Change." Known for their inward-looking lyrics—a pioneering thing in a scene more given to social and political themes—and the gruff allure of Alec MacKaye's vocals, The Faith was highly esteemed by local punk fans. They have probably made a deeper impact on the underground. They created the sound that went on to shape much of what came after, especially later period D.C. bands. The Faith shows why hardcore has lasting power, how even music recognised mainly for its brevity and brutality can convey something emotional and immediate, even several years on.

Tie presses are particularly useful for bow ties, due to the creasing and thus deformative nature of the bow tie knot, which involves crushing the ends to produce the 'bow' effect. In time, this crushing affects the appearance of the finished knot. This is particularly the case with bow ties with rectangular ends, rather than the 'bow' shaped ends in some bow ties, though both suffer from crushing to some degree or another. Four-in-hand ties, naturally, are also creased, but rarely to the same extent and, as such, usually require less regular pressing.
