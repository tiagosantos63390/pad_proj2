The species has in recent years expanded its range in Brazil, where there is now a self-sustaining population in the downtown area of Rio de Janeiro. Since this population occurs far from the bird's original range in Brazil – it was only found in the far south and southwest – it is most probably a consequence of escapees from the pet trade. In Rio de Janeiro, the bird can be easily seen at the Aterro do Flamengo gardens – where it nests on palm trees and feeds on their fruit; the Rio birds seem to favor nesting amid the leaves of coconut palm trees – as well as in the vicinity of the neighboring domestic flight terminal, the Santos Dumont Airport and in the gardens of Quinta da Boa Vista, where communal nests of roughly one meter in diameter have been seem. In Santa Catarina State, probable escapees have been reported on occasion for quite some time, and a feral population seems to have established itself in Florianópolis early in the first decade of the 21st century when birds were observed feeding right next to the highway in the Rio Vermelho-Vargem Grande area.
History.
Four 50-horsepower variable drive units rotate the Wheel at a speed of 1.5 rotations per minute. Each passenger ride lasts 12-15 minutes. The Capital Wheel has 1.6 million LED lights with a spectrum of 16,387,064 colors. 
Also called as "non-articulate latex ducts", these ducts are independent units which extend as branched structures for long distances in the plant body.
Upon reaching Cold Harbor, the brigade to which the Second Connecticut Heavy Artillery had been added, stormed and carried a portion of the enemy's works in front of the Cold Harbor House, sustaining heavy loss. It was here that acting Adjutant John T. Hannum received his mortal wound. From Cold Harbor the brigade moved to the James, bivouacking on Taylor's Plantation, and moving hence by water to Bermuda Hundred. Crossing the Appomattox it moved up to the Petersburg front, arriving on the 19th of June. Here the regiment was employed in building breast works, picketing, sharpshooting, with occasional charges upon the enemy's works, involving sharp fighting. On the 29th it took part in the descent upon the Weldon Railroad, in which a considerable portion of the track was completely destroyed.
