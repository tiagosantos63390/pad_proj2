A NLFSR (Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register) is a common component in modern stream ciphers, especially in RFID and smartcard applications. NLFSRs are known to be more resistant to cryptanalytic attacks than Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). It is known how to generate a "n"-bit NLFSR of maximal length "2n", generating a De Bruijn sequence, by extending a maximal-length LFSR with "n" stages; but the construction of other large NLFSRs with guaranteed long periods remains an open problem. Using bruteforce methods, a list of maximum-period "n"-bit NLFSRs for n < 25 has been made as well as for n=25 and n=27

The exhaustion doctrine, also referred to as the first sale doctrine, is a U.S. common law patent doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after an authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an unrestricted, authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder’s exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are exhausted, and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under current law, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew, unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee.
Until 21 December 2007 when both Slovakia and Hungary became part of the Schengen Area, Štúrovo was a major border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary, with Esztergom located on the Hungarian side of the River Danube. The two cities are linked by the Mária Valéria bridge. The road bridge is some 500 metres in length and is named after Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, (1868–1924), the fourth child of Emperor Franz Josef, and Elisabeth.

The castle was garrisoned by parliamentarians during the English Civil War during which time it was badly damaged. Subsequently the castle was slighted by order of parliament (1650) with three sides torn down, and all battlements removed.

The other main difference in sighting arrangements was the use of an elevation angle or alternatively the range. This issue became more complicated in World War I when the effects of barrel wear in changing muzzle velocity were fully recognised. This meant that different guns needed a different elevation angle for the same range. This led many armies to use an elevation angle calculated in a battery command post. However, in the 1930s the British adopted calibrating sights in which range was set on the sight, which automatically compensated for the difference of muzzle velocity from standard.
In 2002, Sonic spun off their entire audio division as Sonic Studio, LLC, to concentrate solely on the DVD marketplace, enterprise software and licensing of IP and source code.

The main role of an artillery observer is to assist friendly artillery in accurately attacking a target. The observer will communicate instructions to the friendly forces to adjust their fire, "walking" it onto the target. Similarly, a forward air controller will help friendly air units adjust their aim in subsequent airstrikes.
This introduces the antagonism between Jesus and "the Jews", as John calls them, a sign perhaps of a non-Jewish audience. This is over the nature of the Temple. The Temple is already destroyed by the time of the writing of John, and John is trying to show right from the start that the old Temple has been replaced by the new Temple, Jesus' resurrected body and the new Christian and Johannine community. This shows to most scholars the split between John's community and Judaism in general. Some of the Dead Sea scrolls also speak of the community as the temple (Brown et al. 954).
Every "contrada" has its own museum, fountain and baptismal font, motto, allied "contrada" (only "Oca" has no allies) and adversary "contrada", typically a neighbor (only four, "Bruco", "Drago", "Giraffa" and "Selva", have no declared adversaries). Often the adversary "contrade" share borders.

In 1940 Xian went to the Soviet Union to compose the score of the documentary film "Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army". Before departure Mao Zedong invited him to dinner. In 1941 the German invasion of the Soviet Union disrupted his work and he attempted to return to China by way of Xinjiang but the local anti-communist warlord, Sheng Shicai, blocked the way and he got stranded in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. It was here that he composed the symphonies "Liberation of the Nation" and "Sacred War", and the suites "Red All Over the River" and "Chinese Rhapsody" for winds and strings. He developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to overwork and malnutrition. After the war, Xian went back to Moscow for medical treatment but could not be completely cured and died of pulmonary disease on October 30, 1945 in a hospital nearby the Moscow Kremlin at the age of 40.

Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in Croydon. Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold early UK Hardcore / Rave, Techno and House and later, garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area), while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors. El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower Productions, Plastician, N Type, Walsh and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well. The shop and its record label have since closed.
Although he was a highly esteemed artist in his days, he is not well known today. Many saw him as the superior violinist of his time and Paganini's greatest successor. Not only did he contribute to polyphonic playing, but he also discovered new idiomatic ways to compose polyphonically conceived violin music. His friends included Hector Berlioz and Felix Mendelssohn.

The "Borodino"-class ships were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers. The engines were designed to reach a top speed of . The lead ship, "Borodino", was fitted with a copy of the La Seyne machinery installed in "Tsesarvich" and built by the Franco-Russian Works. The remaining four "Borodinos" were supplied with machinery designed and built by the Baltic Works. "Borodino"s engines were rated at and its boilers had a working pressure of ; the machinery of her sisters was rated at and their boilers had a working pressure of . Other differences were that "Borodino" was equipped with economisers for her boilers as well as three-bladed screws, while her sisters lacked economisers and had four-bladed propellers.
