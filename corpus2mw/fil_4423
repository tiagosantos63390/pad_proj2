In 1474, a new conflict with Simon III erupted. Troops from Padernborn had devastated Waldeck and in retaliation, Otto took the town of Lichtenau, looted it and took a number of prisoners. Simon III again called in the help of his brother Bernard VII, who marched into Waldeck and besieged the town of Mengeringhausen. Noblemen in Bernard's camp included Count John I of Rietberg and Counts of Hoya, Schaumburg and Diepholz. Otto marched his army to Mengeringhausen to relieve the town. However, his cousin Wolrad I visited Bernard VII in the enemy camp and negotiated a settlement. The siege was lifted and the feud ended.

"I did not read ... as overruling "Wilko" so much as a limitation on "Wilko" in international conduct."
Over the past fifteen years, Liesbet Hooghe, with her spouse Gary Marks, has sought to theorize the conditions of multilevel governance while striving to gain better information. Much of her research and publications can be categorized under five broad topics: regional authority and multilevel governance; international authority and multilevel governance; party politics and public opinion on European integration; political elites and the European Commission; measurement and data collection. In May 2010, Professors Hooghe and Marks received a five-year European Research Grant to conduct research on the causes and consequences of multilevel governance.
