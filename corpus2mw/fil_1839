Offense was smothered for the most part by both sides as the Patriots and Cowboys entered the game within reach of clinching their divisions and amid burgeoning rumors that Bill Parcells was going to leave New England. Drew Bledsoe and Troy Aikman were repeatedly stymied in the red zone (one Aikman incompletion went between the goalposts, prompting Chris Berman to joke afterward, "The kick is up...good!") and they combined for five interceptions and just 346 passing yards; Ty Law accounted for both Aikman picks while Bledsoe was picked off twice by Darren Woodson. Adam Vinatieri booted two field goals and also ran down Herschel Walker on a long kick return; this led Parcells after the game to say to Vinatieri, "You're not a kicker, you're a football player." Chris Boniol booted four field goals, but the game wasn't decided until Parcells went for it on two fourth downs in the fourth quarter and failed on both. The win clinched the NFC East for the Cowboys.
