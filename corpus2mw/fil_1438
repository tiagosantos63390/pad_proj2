These three Mach effects - thrust, open curved space and closed timelike curves - are developed from only the first two terms in the delta mass equation since the contribution from the third effect is considered extremely small. There is a third term which only becomes significant when larger stellar masses are used. In the distant future, the third term may provide a source of additional Mach effects.

Brands is an animated lecturer who presents history through stories. Brands initially intended to write a history of the United States in six volumes, but he could generate no interest in a publisher for such an endeavor. He chose to come at the issue from the perspective of biographies, a genre for which a broad interest was well established. His biographical works are really 'life and times' stories with the emphasis on the times. Researching an historical period he looks for characters by which to tell the story of the time, creating through them a voice the readers can identify with. Personal notes and writings, letters and diary entries are all items of great interest to Brands as they allow the period to come alive. Said Brands: "History "is" a story... in fact, it is the best story I can think of."
