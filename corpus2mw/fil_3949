The remains of the small ibises in the genus have only been found on the islands of Maui and Molokai, which formed part of the prehistoric island of Maui Nui until about 200,000 years ago when rising sea levels fragmented it. Olson and James speculate that the genus was endemic to Maui Nui, that the ibises were birds of the forest floor, that because of their flightlessness they were susceptible to becoming trapped in lava tubes, and that they may have exerted heavy predation pressure on Maui Nui’s land snails.

To longtime Seattle soccer fans, "Camelot" doesn't bring to mind images of knights and round tables. Instead, it evokes fond memories of the likes of Davy Butler, Adrian Webster, Tommy Hutchison, and the early years of the Seattle Sounders. The soccer team, which existed for 10 years, seemingly suffered from a split personality. The first five years saw steady growth, and are considered, by those in the know, to be the Camelot years. The last five years were both glorious and awful, marked by inconsistency and high-drama.

The CheiRank is an eigenvector with a maximal real eigenvalue of the Google matrix formula_1 constructed for a directed network with the inverted directions of links. It is similar to the PageRank vector, which ranks the network nodes in average proportionally to a number of incoming links being the maximal eigenvector of the Google matrix formula_2 with a given initial direction of links. Due to inversion of link directions the CheiRank ranks the network nodes in average proportionally to a number of outgoing links. Since each node belongs both to CheiRank and PageRank vectors the ranking of information flow on a directed network becomes two-dimensional.

"Gwawinapterus" was assigned to the Istiodactylidae, using the method of comparative anatomy. By comparison with the skull of the istiodactylid "Istiodactylus sinensis", the wingspan of "Gwawinapterus" has been estimated at three metres. The authors noted that as a pterosaur, it would be the youngest known istiodactylid specimen by forty million years and the only known toothed pterosaur from the Late Cretaceous. This would imply that pterosaur variation had declined less than previously presumed during the Cretaceous period.
