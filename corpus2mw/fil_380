While "Brett" is sometimes pitched into the fermenter, aging in wood barrels previously infected with "Brettanomyces" is another method used to impart the complexity and sourness contributed by these strains of yeast.
The AGO sponsors a number of education programs, including "Pipe Organ Encounters," which are intended to introduce youth to the organ and its workings. It also produces a series of instructional DVDs for organists, providing insights into advanced playing technique, organ registration, improvisation, and interpretation. Renowned organists on these "Master Series" videos are: Catherine Crozier (vol. 1), Marie-Claire Alain (vol. 2), Frederick Swann (vol. 3), Gerre Hancock (vol. 4), and Marilyn Mason (vol. 5).
