The growth of the Internet's influence has also had an impact on women's choices in infant feeding. The Internet has served as both a vector for formula advertisement and a means by which women can connect with other mothers to gain support and share experiences from breastfeeding.

Not only does the band allow their religious beliefs to influence their music, but religion also affects their social activism. All members are vegetarians and are heavily involved with PETA. They set up tables at their concerts, which inform fans of the organization and their beliefs on animal rights. Matt Rhodes, in speaking about their activism, says that endorsing a cause was an essential part of the punk movement. Although that sentiment has faded over the years, And Then There Were None will continue to speak up about their beliefs. In referring to animals in particular, Rhodes is also quoted as saying, “Furthermore, the unnecessary killing of animals for food is not only disgusting, but wrong. We all strongly believe in speaking out for animals, and refuse to be silenced to please the general public."
