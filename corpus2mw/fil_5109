AMC, the network which broadcast the first three seasons, canceled the series after its second season, and revived it for a third, ultimately canceled it again after the third season in September 2013. However, in November 2013, two months after AMC cancelled the series, Netflix, partnering with Fox Television Studios (the production company for "The Killing"), announced it had picked up the series for a fourth and final season consisting of six episodes. Series developer and executive producer Veena Sud returned as showrunner, with Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin returning as writers and executive producers. Because they are airing on Netflix, episodes in the fourth season have a longer running time of approximately 55–59 minutes compared to 43 minutes when the series aired on AMC with commercials, and characters are able to use stronger profanity.
