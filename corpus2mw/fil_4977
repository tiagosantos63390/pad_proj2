The old hotel was acquired in 2004 by Greg Vilk, a former tenant who had operated the last three businesses in the building. Vilk had sued previous owner Joseph Bujack for breach of his lease agreement and took ownership of it as part of the settlement. At the time of the transfer, Bujack owed over $308,000 in fines on the building. Vilk and his ownership group Kent LLC had plans to redevelop the building, but none of them ever materialized.

Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock already was a devout patriot as a youth, as is shown by a "War Song" written in 1749 honouring the Prussian king Frederick the Great. When the king, however, did not patronize German artists and poets but declared his love for French culture, Klopstock thought that it was up to him to defend German poetry.

Early career.
Svimon was married twice; he first married, in 1712, Gulkan (Guka; died 1717), daughter of Bardzim, Duke of Aragvi, and then, already a widower, Ana (fl. 1724 – 1745), daughter of Prince Paata Amilakhvari. Svimon had two sons by his first marriage—Beri (fl. 1724) and Archil—and two sons by his second marriage—Stepane (1727–1744) and Dimitri (1729–1745). Svimon's first wife and many of his household died in an outbreak of plague in 1717 and the prince built a church in Tbilisi in their honor. His son of the second marriage, Prince Dimitri married in Russia, in 1743, as her third husband, Princess Stepanida Rzhevskaya (1705–1762), former wife of Prince Aleksandr Galitzine and of Colonel Iakinf Alymov.
The commission itself was announced in August 2006 and sought to establish "the conclusive truth regarding human rights violations to have occurred prior to, immediately after the Popular Consultation on 30 August 1999" as well as "prepare recommendations that can contribute to healing wounds of the past and strengthen friendship". The timing of the commission's creation was criticized by some, as it was believed that it was created to intentionally subvert calls for an international tribunal to deal with the events surrounding the 1999 plebiscite. The commission's mandate allowed it to review documents pertaining to four other inquiries surrounding the events that predated it: "The Indonesian National Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights Violations in East Timor in 1999", "The Indonesian Ad Hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor", "The Special Panels for Serious Crimes", and "The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation".

When a new courthouse was built in 1964, county officials planned to demolish the old courthouse; however, local outcry convinced the county to temporarily save the building. The courthouse sat disused and neglected until 1967, when the Iroquois County Historical Society formed and purchased the building for a museum. The museum is the home of the county's genealogical records library and includes collections of minerals and fossils, Native American artifacts, antique dolls, and numerous other historical items. The original courtroom is now used as a theater and concert hall.
