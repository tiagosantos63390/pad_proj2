This species is from Emsian-aged freshwater strata of the Late Eifelian Qujing Formation in Middle Devonian Qujing, China, and predates "M. dickii". "M. sinensis" differs from "M. dickii" in that the former has some of its tubercles arranged and fused together to form distinctive lines on its thoracic armor, and that the former is larger, with an estimated total armor length of about 3 to 4 centimeters.

Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, allows the applied statistical geneticist to convert one's data from several input formats to a large number output formats suitable for analysis by commonly used software packages. In a typical human genetics study, the analyst often needs to use a variety of different software programs to analyze the data, and these programs usually require that the data be formatted to their precise input specifications. Conversion of one's data into these multiple different formats can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Mega2, by providing validated conversion pipelines, can accelerate the analyses while reducing errors.
