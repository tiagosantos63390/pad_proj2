VVS has received on numerous occasions Federal funding for improvements to the facilities and runways specifically from the Aviation Development Program (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) after 2001. In 2005, the new terminal opened at a cost in excess of $2,000,000. In 2009, VVS received $1 million from Federal (Rural Community Assistance Partnership grant) and state sources to extend the main runway (runway safe zone project).

Issue.
During the film's launch in China, the Hollywood blockbuster "Avatar" was reportedly going to be pulled from nearly 1,600 2-D screens across China, to benefit the wide release of this film. Instead, "Avatar" showings continued in the fewer, but more popular 900 3-D screens throughout China, which generated over 64% of the film's total ticket sales in China. The Hong Kong newspaper "Apple Daily" speculates that the Chinese authorities were worried "Avatar" had seized the market share from domestic films and noted that many of the vacant cinema slots will be replaced by "Confucius", and the film would be "drawing unwanted attention to the sensitive issue" concerning forced evictions of Chinese homes. However, China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television responded by stating it was a "commercial decision", and because the "box office performance of the 2D version has not been great." However, due to low attendance for "Confucius", and high demand for "Avatar", the Chinese government reversed their decision, and allowed "Avatar" to remain on some 2-D screens in China. This choice appeared to be at least partly based on the financial performance of the two films, with "Avatar" grossing nearly 2.5 times more money per day.

The words of the widows of Muño's companions on visiting the cemetery in Toledo where Muño and their husbands were buried:<br>    Oh Munio Alfonso, we grieve over you. Just as a woman loves her husband, so the city of Toledo loved you. In combat your shield never turned away, and your spear never turned back. Your sword always achieved great victories. Do not announce his death in Córdoba and Sevilla, nor in the house of King Texufin, lest the daughters of the Saracens rejoice, and the daughters of Toledo be saddened.
