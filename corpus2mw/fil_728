The Army rejected the pistol, but from criticism he received, Luger improved it, creating the Parabellum pistol (commonly called a Luger). This pistol was a success for both Luger and DWM.

In an autobiographical chapter of his book, "Becoming Gay: The Journey to Self-Acceptance", Isay tells the story of how he spent ten years trying to change his homosexual orientation. During his analysis, he married. After completing his analysis, he realized that he was, in fact, gay. He was closeted for several years, during which time he became a prominent member of the American Psychoanalytic Association. He began to write and about homosexuality shortly after meeting his life partner, in 1979.
The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union was one of few unions in the 1930s that was open to all races.

The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union leaders were often harassed and ignored.
