The seven-ball had to be called before being pocketed. Failing to call it or calling a pocket other than where it really went would result of the seven-ball being re-spotted and player at the table loses his turn. Also, winning by pocketing the seven-ball wasn't permitted.

The brigade had its own shoulder patch which was most recently worn in 2006â€“2007. The shoulder sleeve insignia depicted Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson mounted on his horse, a reference to the 116th's lineage as the Stonewall Brigade. The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 116th Infantry Brigade on 26 May 1978. The patch's nickname is "Stony on a Pony." When the 29th Infantry Division was reactivated in 1985, the brigade was assigned to the division and began wearing the division shoulder patch. Following the Army's reorganization of combat divisions in 2005 into brigade-centric units, ARNG brigades within divisions began wearing brigade patches as Department of the Army policy. The 116th BCT has returned to wearing the division shoulder patch 1 April 2007.
