After winning the World Series in 1986 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP Ray Knight, who then signed with the Baltimore Orioles. Also, they traded the flexible Kevin Mitchell to the Padres for long-ball threat Kevin McReynolds. But the biggest shock since the Midnight Massacre of 1977 was when Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. But after struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, "Dr. K" would come back, and so would the Mets. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading Ed Hearn to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone. They would surge to battle St. Louis for the division title. They would have two tough losses to the Cardinals. The first came on Seat Cushion Night where Tom Herr hit a walk-off grand slam. But the worst loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman Terry Pendleton hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was Darryl Strawberry and Howard Johnson becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season.
The film has been awarded the "Best First Cinematographic Work" at the French "César" event.

History.
The Great Depression compromised the execution of the plans Wagner and Ermisch had come up with. Initially, the budget had been a sum of 5 million Reichsmark (RM) that was supposed to have been spent on an additional five of the two-storeyed halls, as well as a large, circular main restaurant, a pier with a café on it, a marina and an open air theater. Furthermore, a medicinal bath, a kindergarten and a pension had been thought of. Of all that, only the existing four-structure complex was realized, and only after the maior visited the site to see that most of the reduced project had already been built and would not require much further work. In the end, about 2 million Reichsmark were spent.
The title originally started development under GRIN, who had developed the previous title. When the company folded four months into development, Fatshark took over, having worked with GRIN previously on other games. Some key employees worked with Fatshark following the closing of GRIN. Simon Viklund, Creative Director on the first "Rearmed" was hired as a Creative Advisor to the Fatshark team. Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked "They were taking over things mid-project and I worked as a creative advisor during the hand-over to tell them what they were looking at." Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. "I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. thought it would be a nice way to convey that now everyone will see that bionics can't always be controlled." He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them.

The 2014 Pacific typhoon season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season will run throughout 2014, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a "W" suffix.
