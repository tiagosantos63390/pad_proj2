In the first trimester, all students, irrespective of their chosen medium, are taught the basics of Broadcast, Web and Print. From the second trimester onwards, students learn reporting in their choice of medium. The highlight of the stream specialisations are the in-house publications that students work on throughout the term. Print students publish their newspaper ‘The Word’ twice a week. Similarly New Media students report for their news e-zine, ACJ Newsline on a daily basis. Television and radio students produce news shows everyday.

Randy Winn broke this record in 2010; Adam Dunn is the current record holder. (Ernie Banks, who played most of his career before the League Championship Series was introduced, holds the all-time record.)
