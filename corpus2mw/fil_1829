Capranica, having already suffered severe losses at Rome through the enmity of the Orsini, took refuge first with Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan and later appealed (1432) to the Council of Basle for recognition of his title. Among his entourage when he left for Basel was Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius II. The Basel assembly recognized Capranica's promotion, but to punish him for adhering to the council Eugene IV deprived him of all honors and dignities, also of his possessions. Capranica sought a reconciliation with the pope at Florence (30 April 1434). Eugene restored to him his offices and goods, gave him the cardinalatial Title of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and sent him to the Council at Ferrara with a special commission to treat with the Greek bishops and theologians concerning the reunion of the Churches.

Higham Ferrers was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1556 and was first summoned to elect a representative to the Parliament of 1557â€“1558. The right to vote was exercised by the Mayor, aldermen, burgesses (members of the town corporation) and freemen, provided they were householders in the borough and not receiving alms; in 1831 this comprised a total of 33 voters. Since the corporation elected its own successors and had the right to create freemen (which was sparingly used), this ensured that the power was self-perpetuating and usually entirely under the influence of the local landowner or "patron".
