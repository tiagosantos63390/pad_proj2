The court "a quo"'s finding in this case had already come under some criticism before it was heard on appeal. Kritzinger, for example, noted that, in Roman law, a lessee did not have a real right in the hired property, but merely a personal right against the lessor on the contract. If the lessor sold the property, the buyer could generally evict the lessee. In this regard the Roman law was modified by the "huur gaat voor koop" principle, which principle became part of the Roman-Dutch law. Accordingly, the rule is not based on legal principle but is merely an expression embodying the general effect which custom and legislation had introduced into the law governing the lease of lands and houses: that is, that the buyer will be bound by the material terms of the contract, and therefore bound by the option to renew the lease.
