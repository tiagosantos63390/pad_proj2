They are thought to be one of the pioneering bands of the original Southern California punk rock movement out of Orange County, California, and their style closely associated with The Dickies, The Germs, and other bands from that place and time. In the mid-'80s there was a notable change in their style of music – taking more from their country music and rock and roll. Mike Ness admits in the DVD commentary from "Another State of Mind" that he may have even tried "too" hard on the "Prison Bound" album. They did eventually find their niche, and the majority of their albums from the mid-80s on to the early '90s are considered to be punk rock or rockabilly – a melodic punk sound that is distinctly – and distinctively – their own.

"Bagley" operated locally in the waters off of the coast of the Republic of the Philippines for the rest of the month. Early in March, the frigate’s task group visited Singapore on the way to duty in the eastern Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. While operating in the "I.O." "Bagley" briefly anchored off of the coast of Mombasa, Kenya, however the crew was denied liberty there, due to concerns over the AIDS epidemic there. After months in the Indian Ocean, "Bagley" participated in joint exercises with units of the Pakistani Navy. Then, Bagley stopped off at Karachi, Pakistan, between 15 and 17 March before dropping anchor at Masirah Island, Oman, on the 18th.
