In the mean time, Moamorias under the leadership of Bharathi Raja, who came out of his hiding, regrouped themselves at Bengmara. Kamaleswar Singha, now, commanded Haripad Dekaphukan to deal with the insurgency caused by Bharathi Raja. Haripad Dekaphukan marched against Bharathi Raja with six companies of sepoys and chased the rebels from their strongholds. The royal army continued their pursuit for rebels and found them out in deep forest. The soldiers surrounded the rebels from all sides. Their leader Bharathi Raja fought bravely until he was hit by rifle shot and later pierced to death by rifle bayonets of Ahom soldiers. Seeing their leader fall, the Moamorias broke and dispersed into the forest. By order of the King the corpse of Bharathi Raja was transfixed to a spear in the midst of the newly settled Moamoria village at Khutiapota. Large numbers of Moamoria and Morans offered their submission to Royal authority and large number of articles and provisions were recovered from them. These successive defeats appear to have convinced the Moamorias of the hopelessness of further resistance, and for several years no further trouble was given by them in Eastern Assam.
