Hereford Castle was a castle in the cathedral city of Hereford, the county town of Herefordshire, England (). Founded sometime before 1052, it was one of the earliest castles in England. Hereford Castle was probably destroyed when the Welsh sacked Hereford in 1055, but seems to have been replaced by the following decade. During the civil war of King Stephen's reign, the castle was besieged three times; the garrison surrendered each time and control of Hereford Castle changed hands.

Part of the output signal is usually fed back to the input (a 're-circulating delay line'), producing a resonance effect which further enhances the intensity of the peaks and troughs. The phase of the fed-back signal is sometimes inverted, producing another variation on the flanging sound.

In his discussions of halakot Johanan considered expediency and economy as well as law and authority. When Ṭarfon declared that only olive-oil was appropriate for the Sabbath-lamp, Johanan became impatient: "And what shall the Babylonians do where none but sesame-oil is to be had; and what shall the Medians do, who have nothing but nut-oil; and the Alexandrians, who have nothing but radish-oil; or the Cappadocians, who have only naphtha?" (Shab. 26a). On another occasion, when Akiba suggested that a married woman who has become the common talk of the "spinsters by the moon" ought to be divorced, Johanan remarked, "In that case there is no chance for a daughter of Judah to live with a husband! Only where infidelity is fully established by legal evidence may a divorce be imposed" (Giṭ. 89a; see Deut. xix. 15, xxiv. 1). In the Aggadah he is not often cited. He was very pious, and therefore later rabbis said that when one dreams of Johanan b. Nuri one may hope to develop a wholesome fear of sin (Ab. R. N. xl. S. Schechter, p. 64b).

There are not the usual pre-set adventures or encounters with monsters and non-player characters that result in camping. While the game allows for combat with certain types of creatures, and permits player versus player (PvP) conflict, it has a strong system of consent, which means that one has to specifically allow their character to come to harm from the environment or from another player. Even social interactions may be consented or denied, to prevent unwanted intrusive interactions with other players. This is to prevent "griefing" by other players.
