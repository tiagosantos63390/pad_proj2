According to legend, the castle Veveří ("squirrel" in Czech) was founded by Přemyslid Duke Conrad of Brno in the middle of the 11th Century, then only as a hunting lodge. Nevertheless, the first credible recorded mention about the castle is from the years 1213 and 1222, when King Přemysl Otakar I used the fortified castle as a prison for rebellious peers. Initially, it was apparently a wooden residence situated near the church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary west of the present compound. In the 1220s a stone castle on the extremity of the rocky promontory behind a deep moat cut out of the rock started to grow. The so-called keep is the only structure which has remained well-preserved from this oldest building stage.

The 2003 title game was one of the most thrilling championship matches in Arizona high school football history. The opponent, John Wrenn's Hamilton Huskies, fought hard with the Toros. The game went into three overtimes, where Hamilton would win 35-28. Since that game, both teams' fortunes have changed; Mountain View has only appeared in one state championship since (in 2006, took the loss to Hamilton), even posting the first losing campaign ever in 2010 and the first playoff-less season ever in 2011, while Hamilton has taken the role of football powerhouse. In all, Mesa Mountain View has appeared in 13 5A title games, with an 8-5 record.


By now the perimeter along the river was only about wide. In the south-east a large force of Germans managed to break through the brigade's perimeter and overran one of the division's artillery batteries, located at the rear of Lonsdale Force. The other artillery batteries opened fire on the Germans from a range of and requested infantry as well as anti-tank weapons to come to their assistance. The German force including two Panther tanks and SP guns, came close to cutting the defenders off from the river and were only defeated by the artillery, followed up by bayonet and grenade counter-attacks. Lonsdale Force spent the rest of the day in close quarters battles with Waffen SS infantry. The fight was likened to a "snowball fight with grenades" and at least one tank was destroyed with a Gammon bomb. In the afternoon, more Germans managed to infiltrate the perimeter. Only intervention by the guns of 64 Medium Regiment firing on the British positions prevented the division's headquarters from being overrun.
Rejangese is not obviously close to other Malayo-Polynesian languages. McGinn (2009) classified it among the Bidayuh languages of Borneo, closest to Bukar Sadong. It may be that it is related to the newly described language Nasal, but that is speculative at this point.

Holmgren was selected by the Edmonton Oilers 67th overall in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft. He never played for Edmonton as his WHA rights were traded to the Minnesota Fighting Saints. A year later he was selected by the Philadelphia Flyers 108th overall in the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft. He began his professional career with the Fighting Saints in 1975–76, but left the team on February 28, 1976, three days before it folded because of financial problems. He signed with the Flyers shortly after and made his NHL debut a month later. Holmgren's hectic first professional season nearly ended in tragic fashion. While playing for the Richmond Robins, the Flyers AHL affiliate at the time, he suffered a scratched cornea. He was rushed to surgery in a Boston hospital and an allergic reaction to the anesthetic nearly cost him his life.

The station was founded in the 1948 as WJMJ ("Jesus, Mary, Joseph"), which broadcast middle-of-the-road music and religious programming. In the mid-1960s it was acquired by Rust Craft Greeting Cards, which changed the call sign to WRCP and in 1967 changed the format to country music. In 1981, after WFIL adopted a country format, WRCP switched to oldies. Later in 1985, the call sign was changed to WSNI to match a co-owned FM station; for a time, WSNI broadcast an all-Beatles-and-Motown format. After 2 years a more conventional oldies mix returned and the station became WPGR ("Philly Gold Radio"). In 1995, when the station was sold to new set of owners operating as Global Radio LLC, it became WNWR and switched to mostly ethnic brokered programming. On June 13, 2011, WNWR's entire brokered program schedule moved to WWDB.

In 1932 he established the New Commonwealth Society for ‘the promotion of international law and order’, writing several books on the right use of force, notably "The Problem of the Twentieth Century" (1930), which was translated into German and other languages.
