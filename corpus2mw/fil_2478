The java loach, like its fellow "Pangio" species, has a long eel-like body with small eyes set high in the skull. Its rayed dorsal fin is set far back on the dorsal side, halfway between the tail and middle of the fish. The tail ends with a flat edge and may be slightly forked in the middle.
The Cornish Institute of Engineers (CIE) was founded in 1913 by the then Principal of the Camborne School of Mines, J.J. Beringer. Its first President, Josiah Paul, was appointed on 1 March 1913. It is the only institute in Cornwall and maintains a continuous programme of lectures. The origins of the Institute go back to the Camborne Association of Engineers, a small but prestigious body existing in the early years of the 20th century and composed mainly of mechanical engineers. Since 2011, the CIE has been affiliated with the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.
