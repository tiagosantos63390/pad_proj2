By 1848, the stone fort was finished, replacing the wooden fortifications. In the meantime a sizeable and growing Christian settlement continued to flourish around the Recollect mission, rededicated since the expulsion of the Jesuits, to St Isabel de Portugal (Elizabeth of Portugal). The Fort thus established was subsequently named in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Indies, and was named Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda. The military garrison was initially placed under the direct command of the Fuerza de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar) in Zamboanga.
Katex (also, Gədıx [gyadıkh, Katekh, and Katekhi; ) is a village at the foot of the Caucasian Mountains and the most populous municipality, except for the capital Balakən, in the Balakan Rayon of Azerbaijan. The village takes its name from Turkic "gədik" (which in local dialect sounds like "gədıx") for nearby mountain passageway, which has been used for centuries to cross the Caucasian mountains from its northern side to Southern. The name Gədıx is still used by older generation of the local population, whereas the new and/or unfamiliar with local custom people use the "modernised" name. The name was changed to Katekh (formerly Katekhi) probably during short period in 1918-1921 when Katex was the part of the Georgian Democratic Republic.
