Location.
In early 2004, the company purchased 99.9 FM WRZA from Entravision and in late 2004, the company purchased three suburban Chicago radio stations from Spanish Broadcasting System: 92.5 FM WDEK, 92.7 FM WKIE and 92.7 FM WKIF. The trimulcast was formerly the home to Energy 92.7&5. WKIF was broken away from the trimulcast and WRZA took its place. WKIF became a CNN Radio affiliate. The new trimulcast became a variety hits format as Nine FM, and the station later became a split-format station with Nine FM during the day and Dance Hits format "Dance Factory" at night. Dance Factory is operated by TKC Entertainment, which leases the air time form Newsweb. Nine FM was discontinued as of October 19, 2008 in favor of Progressive Talk simulcast with sister station WCPT (AM).

Construction as far as Raleigh's Cross, at the head of the incline, had cost £82,000 compared with the estimate of £65,000 for construction of the entire line. Further construction was delayed, therefore, but it resumed in 1863 and reached Gupworthy in September 1864. The goal of reaching Hoult Point, the originally intended western terminal of the line, was abandoned. By now the Ebbw Vale Company Ltd had taken over the Iron Works company, and also the mines, and a new lease of the line to them, until September 1919, was made.
Simple LRC format was introduced by Kuo (Djohan) Shiang-shiang's "Lyrics Displayer". It was one of the first programs, if not the first, that attempted to simulate Karaoke performance. It usually displays a "whole line" of lyrics, but it is possible to display a word at a time, such as one would see in modern Karaoke machines, by creating a time tag for each word rather than each line.

Already exhausted through overwork before arriving in Los Angeles, Harrison lost his voice early on in the rehearsals and contracted laryngitis, the results of which were obvious on the finished songs, particularly "Dark Horse". Harrison and his tour band recorded the album's title track live on a sound stage at A&M in late October, with Norm Kinney engineering the session.
