During the campaign, he called for a speed limit reduction in the Plateau, increased security in parks and at metro stations, more co-op housing and support for local artists, and more parking spots for businesses. Vision Montreal lost the election to Gérald Tremblay's Montreal Island Citizens Union, and Tétrault served as a member of the official opposition.
