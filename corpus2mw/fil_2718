Elsewhere, we are introduced to John Smith (Val Kilmer), an inmate serving a life sentence for killing the entire families of two men who brutally raped and murdered his wife and daughter. He is initially shown in San Quentin prison, having started a riot among the prison population for what appears to be his own pleasure. During a visit with his friend Gordon (Sam Shepard), a former prison guard who John had saved from being killed, Gordon reveals John has been given one final chance before being stuck in solitary confinement for life. Gordon requests that John be transferred, and subsequently, John is sent to the SHU as well, and becomes Wade's new cellmate.
