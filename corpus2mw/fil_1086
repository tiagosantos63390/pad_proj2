Alvin Nugent "Bo" McMillin (January 12, 1895 â€“ March 31, 1952) was an American football player and coach, who served at both the collegiate and professional levels. He played college football at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, where he was a three-time All-American at quarterback, and led the Centre Praying Colonels to a historic upset victory over Harvard in 1921. After graduating from Centre, McMillin played professionally with the Milwaukee Badgers and Cleveland Indians, two early teams of the National Football League (NFL), in 1922 and 1923.

RCHS also hosts an event for military veterans, called Rancho Remembers, which is held every April/May. The event, founded and organized in 2007 by two of the school's history teachers and a number of students in a club of the same name, gathers a number of veterans in the school's gymnasium, who have the opportunity to share their stories and interact with the school's junior class in a formal setting, with lunch also being served at the event for the veterans and students. The event attracts a large number of veterans each year, with the 2013 event attracting 320 veterans. Rancho Remembers and its founders have received great praise from the veterans, and from local citizens and news outlets, for putting on such a special event that honors the veterans, and teaches the students in a memorable fashion.
