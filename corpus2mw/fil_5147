After graduating from Prospect Park High in 1943, Showell joined the U.S. Army. During his time in the Army, he attended flight school where he became a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black Army Air Corps pilots during World War II. Showell first experienced significant racial discrimination when he joined the military, where he and his fellow airmen were rarely called into action because of the color of their skin. Showell was discharged from the U.S. Army in October 1945.

After mating, a female usually chooses a cavity as its nesting site. If the entrance is too large, a mud wall may first be built in which a hole about in diameter is made. The mud is gathered in small balls by the mandibles, transferred progressively to the fore, mid and hind legs, and deposited in the pollen basket on the hind leg. About six balls make a load, three in each basket and the female flies back to the nest site. Inside the cavity, a pedicel is constructed on which an urn-shaped cell is built. The mud of which it is made hardens as it dries. The outside of the cell is usually covered by a thin layer of faeces brought in by the female and the inside is lined with resin which is drawn up to form a flexible collar at the top. Each brood cell is provisioned with a cream-coloured mass made from a mixture of pollen and nectar, tamped down and filling two thirds of the cell. On about the fourth day after the construction was started, an egg is laid in the cell and the female folds in the collar and caps the cell with mud. The pedicel is extended and further cells are built against the long wall of the first giving a group of neatly arranged cells. The construction and provisioning of the later cells occupies less time.

Fisher began her bid at completing the Seven Summits challenge in January 2003, with Aconcagua in Argentina, followed in July by Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and Mount Elbrus in Russia. In 2004, she climbed Mount Kosciuszko in Australia in January, and Mount McKinley in May. She climbed her penultimate peak of the Seven Summits, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, in January 2005. In June 2005, Fisher successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, making her at 20 years old the youngest American to have done so at the time. Her ascent of Everest marked her completion of the Seven Summits; she became the youngest person ever to have completed the challenge. Most of Fisher's Seven Summit climbs were made with expeditions run by Alpine Ascents, a Seattle-based guiding company, costing a total of US$96,000.

Like her husband, she is known as a portrait and history painter, and she took on female pupils, among whom was the porcelain painter Marie Virginie Boquet. She was a pupil of Charles Meynier and presumeably also of her husband, Louis Hersent. She exhibited at the Paris Salon between 1810 and 1824, obtaining first-class medals in 1817 and 1819.

On receipt of this news Menéndez sent Diego Flores in advance with forty soldiers to reconnoitre the French position; he himself with the chaplain, some officers, and twenty soldiers rejoined Flores at about midnight, and pushed forward to the side of the inlet opposite their encampment. The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Menéndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape over his shoulder, and, carrying a short lance in his hand, went out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.
