After arriving in the New World, Nephi, the son of Lehi left the place of their first landing and traveled with his followers “many days” in the wilderness. “Many” is a non-specific word that can mean anything from "three hours" to “forty days.” This particular journey did not take Nephi and his followers beyond the territory that would later be called the land of Nephi.
In February 2012 The New York Times reported that Pet Airways had run into financial problems, canceling flights at the last minute, leaving customers and pets with no recourse, and that customers had reported difficulty getting refunds. In a regulatory filing that month, the company said, "We have experienced a history of losses and have yet to begin generating positive cash flows from operations and, as a result, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern." In 2013, the airline permanently ceased operations.

The Golden Ratio, roughly equal to 1.618, was first formally introduced in text by Greek mathematician Pythagoras and later by Euclid in the 5th century BC. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle noted its aesthetic properties. Aside from interesting mathematical properties, geometric shapes derived from the golden ratio, such as the golden rectangle, the golden triangle, and Kepler’s triangle, were believed to be aesthetically pleasing. As such, many works of ancient art exhibit and incorporate the golden ratio in their design. Various authors can discern the presence of the golden ratio in Egyptian, Summerian and Greek vases, Chinese pottery, Olmec sculptures, and Cretan and Mycenaean products from as early as the late Bronze Age. The prevalence of this special number in art and architecture even before its formal discovery by Pythagoras is perhaps evidence of an instinctive and primal human cognitive preference for the golden ratio.
