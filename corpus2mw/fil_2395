Elysia started as "Elysium's Revenge", while the band members were still in high school. The band gained notoriety in the Shingle Springs-Cameron Park area with their empty shows at the Shingle Springs Community Center. By the end of 2003, they shortened their name to "Elysia" and added a second vocalist, Justin Chambers who helped them record their first EP. Months later, they pen "Incinerate", a song that has grown to become a staple in their setlist. In the spring of 2004, they recorded a second EP, with the first occurrence of "Incinerate". The release show for this EP features Suffokate and The Frontline. That summer and fall, they would write "Triumph" and "Filthy".
