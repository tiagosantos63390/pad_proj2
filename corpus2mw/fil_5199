It is assumed that there exists some linear operator formula_38 that can take some arbitrary quantum state formula_39 to formula_14 efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given formula_14 as input. Any error in the preparation of state formula_14 is ignored.
