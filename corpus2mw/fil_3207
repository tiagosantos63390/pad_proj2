The Glasgow Herald magazine praised the band's style, hailing them as their "new favourite Scottish Band" drawing similarities with the powerpop of XTC and The Undertones. The band have received mainly positive coverage from the press, with further praise coming from The Daily Record describing the band as "the best thing to come out of St Andrews since KT Tunstall". The List described the group as having a "charming playfulness" and "unpretentious style". After seeing the band perform at FÃªte de la Musique as part of Glasgow's West End Festival, Paul Whitelaw described the band in his review of the event in The Scotsman as "Juicy, chewy pop-kids to savour, proving that life still twitches in this indie guitar-pop business". The Fly deem the band to "showcase a sound too big to be Scotland's secret for much longer" and have carried a number of positive live reviews.
Rail lines run parallel to the highway, but there is no longer a station in Frontenac.
