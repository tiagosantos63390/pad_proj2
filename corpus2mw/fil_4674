The Grinnell System is a fast-tempo style of basketball developed by coach Dave Arseneault at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, USA. It is a variation of the run-and-gun system popularized by coach Paul Westhead at Loyola Marymount University in the early 1980s. The Grinnell System relies on shooting three-point field goals, applying constant pressure with a full-court press, and substituting players frequently.
