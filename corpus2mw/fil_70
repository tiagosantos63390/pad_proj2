Wright County was open up for settlement by white pioneers in 1855. The village of Buffalo was platted in 1856 to 1858. The town of Buffalo is actually named after the carp-like fish that were once abundant in the region. Buffalo remained a small town until the mid-19th century when it became a popular resort town for wealthy day-trippers from the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. There were several resorts located around Lake Pulaski, which along with Buffalo Lake is one of the two largest lakes in Buffalo. Visitors would take a train from the Twin Cities and arrive in Buffalo only an hour later. Buffalo remained a popular resort destination from the 1890s until the 1920s. During the summer months, Buffalo's population would nearly double in size with all the visiting tourists. Today, many visitors still come to Buffalo for the fishing on Lake Pulaski and Buffalo Lake, as well as for shopping in the many boutiques and antique shops. Their monthly sales attract many non-residents.
