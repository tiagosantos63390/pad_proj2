The red-bellied titi has a variety of postures and facial expressions that it uses as visual signals. Swaying the entire body, turning the head sideways and lowering the head to face downward are examples of these signals. Observers have seen that these signals are a response to a disturbance or escape tendencies. Arching of the back is a signal that the red-bellied titi uses to warn that they're about to attack. This signal is associated with hostility, after they arch their backs an attack usually follows. Other signals associated with hostility include piloerection and tail lashing. These tend to follow back arching and are often used as scare tactics. Facial expressions observed in these species include partial and complete shutting of the eyes, protrusion of the lips and baring of the teeth which is usually followed by smacking of the lips.
