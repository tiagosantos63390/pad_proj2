Ājīvika is thought to be contemporaneous to other early Indian nāstika philosophical schools of thought, such as Cārvāka, Jainism and Buddhism. While the early nāstika systems such as Cārvāka and Ājīvika gradually became extinct or evolved into others, the Jain and Buddhist traditions spun off into what may be described today as separate religions, distinct from Hinduism (which is now restrictively meant to encompass only the six orthodox "Āstika" philosophical systems).

Albini further explained that, while he takes the game seriously, he is "not particularly competitive, and "only play tournaments when I’m out for the WSOP.” Albini expressed an appreciation for the "less macho" attitudes that exist in the game and was opposed to "assholes that try to dominate the table or are King Shit of their local card room. It just galls me and makes me think less of all the people that do it.”

Overall, despite their technical innovation, Japanese submarines were built in small numbers and had less effect on the war than those of the other major navies. The IJN pursued the doctrine of "guerre d'escadre" (fleet vs fleet warfare), and consequently submarines were often used in offensive roles against warships, which were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships. During the Battle of Midway, "I-168" administered the "coup de grace" to , as well as sinking the destroyer . Later in 1942, Japanese submarine "I-19" sank the fleet carrier , damaged the battleship , and damaged the destroyer (which sank later on 19 October 1942) with a single salvo of torpedoes. However, as fuel oil diminished and air superiority was lost, Imperial submarines were no longer able to continue with such successes. Once the United States was able to increase its production of destroyers and destroyer escorts, as well as bringing over highly effective anti-submarine techniques learned during the Battle of the Atlantic, they continually took more and more of a toll on Imperial Japanese submarines, which also tended to be slower and not as deeply diving as their "Kriegsmarine" counterparts. The Imperial Japanese Navy's doctrine of fleet warfare ("guerre d'escadre") resulted in its submarines seldom posing a threat to allied merchant convoys and shipping lanes to the degree that the Kriegsmarine's U-boats did as they pursued commerce raiding against Allied and neutral merchant ships.

In 2004, Menu announced his return to production-based touring car racing, with the fledgling Chevrolet team, RML in the 2005 World Touring Car Championship season. Menu, and his equally highly regarded team-mate Nicola Larini, did not expect to win races in their first year but the team's performance was still seen as a big disappointment, Menu only achieving three points finishes, his best result being a 6th at Spa-Francorchamps.
