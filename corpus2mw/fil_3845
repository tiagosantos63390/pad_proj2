"Scyllarus pygmaeus" was first described in 1888 by Charles Spence Bate as part of the results of the "Challenger" expedition. He based his description of ""Arctus pygmaeus"" on material from "off Gomera" in the Canary Islands. In the same publication, he also described ""Arctus immaturus"" from the Cape Verde archipelago, which Eugène Louis Bouvier realised in 1915 was simply the "nisto" (juvenile) stage of "S. pygmaeus". Applying the principle of first reviser, Bouvier established that "S. pygmaeus" would be the valid name, over "S. immaturus". Although "S. pygmaeus" is not rare in the Mediterranean Sea, its presence there was overlooked for decades, due to the confusion between it and the more conspicuous "S. arctus", whose immature form "S. pygmaeus" was often assumed to be. In 1960, Jacques Forest and Lipke Holthuis demonstrated for the first time that "S. pygmaeus" does indeed occur in the Mediterranean Sea, from museum specimens at the "" in Naples.
