Prince's Major League audition came after a mediocre 1962 season with the Cubs' Triple-A Salt Lake City Bees affiliate, where he won 10 of 24 decisions and had a high earned run average of 5.31, largely as a starting pitcher. In his one MLB game, he pitched in relief in the ninth inning of a 4–1 loss to the New York Mets at the Polo Grounds. He issued a base on balls to the first man he faced, Joe Christopher, then hit the next batter, Frank Thomas. But Jim Hickman got Prince off the hook by grounding into a 1-6-3 double play and Sammy Drake bounced out to second.
