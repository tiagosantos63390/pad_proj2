John Blakey
In episode 11, Prim attempts to takeover Kotoko's body after LeBlanc disables Kotoko. She gains control of it by the twelfth episode and manages to deliver her body to the "Integral System". Before LeBlanc can fire a fatal shot from his Rampant Armor, Prim manages to restrict the computer systems in his rampant armor, long enough for Misaki to fire the finishing shot. Misaki cannot initially bring herself to take the shot. Prim reveals why she had followed LeBlanc. The two are brother and sister, having been created from the same set of genes. LeBlanc's resistance causes greater damage to Prim's physical body, with LeBlanc eventually gaining the upperhand and telling Misaki that if she fires, she'll be killing Prim. She manages to hold LeBlanc at bay long enough for Misaki to fire, shattering the rampant armor and killing Prim.
