The main feud heading into the show was between The Rock and Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. At SummerSlam on August 27, The Rock defeated Kurt Angle and Triple H in a Triple threat match to retain the WWF title. In a rematch at No Mercy (2000), Kurt Angle beat the Rock for the WWF Championship. In the match, Rikishi interfered on Rock's behalf but accidentally nailed him with a savate kick, enabling Angle to finish off Rock with the Angle Slam. The following two months at Armageddon (2000), Angle pinned The Rock to retain the WWF title in a Hell in a Cell, also involving Steve Austin, Triple H, Rikishi and The Undertaker. On the January 1 episode of "Raw Is War", The Rock lost a number one contenders match to Kane by countout after WWF Champion Kurt Angle interfered. A few days later on "SmackDown!", Rock lost a non-title match to Angle by disqualification after nailing Angle with the steel chair. On the February 8 episode of "SmackDown!", The Rock defeated The Big Show to become the number one contender to face the WWF Champion Kurt Angle at No Way Out. On the final episode of "SmackDown!", WWF Champion Kurt Angle teamed with Edge and Christian against The Rock, Kane and The Undertaker in a six man Tables match. At the end, Angle's team won when Angle performed an Angle slam to The Rock through a table for the victory. After the match, he finished off Rock with the ankle lock at the close of the show.
