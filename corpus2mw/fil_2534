Strachwitz had been needed elsewhere, and was soon back to acting as the Army Group's fire brigade. Strachwitz's Panzerverband was broken up in late July. From the morning of July 10 39th Army was introduced into the battle, conducting an assault towards Kaunas.

By early August, the Soviets were again ready to attempt to cut off Army Group North from Army Group Centre.
