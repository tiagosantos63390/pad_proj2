Born into a Quaker family that had been forced to flee their Rahway, New Jersey home during the American Revolution, he was named after the renowned grammarian, Lindley Murray, who "befriended father Samuel Moore in the difficulties growing out of the war." The family re-visited N.J. in 1810, and Lindley Murray Moore stayed there while his father and siblings continued on to Upper Canada (Ontario). He and his wife, Abigail Lydia Mott, opened a Quaker school in Rahway, N.J. soon after they were married 1813. In 1815, they moved to New York City to take charge of a school under the auspices of the Friends Monthly Meeting. By 1820, they had opened their own boarding school for boys first in Flushing, and then in Westchester Village, NY. In 1831, Lindley and Abigail bought a farm in what is now Rochester and built a two story house in the Greek Revival style that is still in use.
