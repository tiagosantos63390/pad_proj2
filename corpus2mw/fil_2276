"Yuruginaimono Hitotsu" is the forty-first single by B'z, released on April 12, 2006. This song is one of B'z many number-one singles in Oricon charts. The B-side "Pierrot" was also featured on the album "Monster" and it has been covered by Aya Kamiki.
The council was composed by "the Governor, the Chancellor, and the Justices of the Supreme Court, or any two of them". The governor presided but, only if the other members' vote was tied, cast the deciding vote.
"LST-662" earned three battle stars for World War II service.

 As stated in the introduction, strictosidine synthase catalyzes the biological Pictetâ€“Spengler reaction of tryptamine and secologanin to stereoselectively form 3-alpha(S)-strictosidine, the universal precursor for monoterpenoid indole alkloid compounds. It also catalyses the formation of 12-aza-strictosidine, an important intermediate for cytotoxic alkaloids, from coupling secologanin with 7-aza-tryptamine. The enzyme is encoded by a single-copy gene, which is subject to coordinate regulation from plant hormones involved in controlling primary and secondary plant metabolism. The encoding gene is rapidly down-regulated by auxin, an essential promoter in cell division, leading to lower levels of alkaloid accumulation. Conversely, the gene is upregulated by jasmonate, a plant stress hormone, through the activation of a 42 base-pair region in the str promoter. Several studies of the "Catharanthus roseus" strictosidine synthase indicate that the enzyme plays a regulatory role in sustaining high rates of alkaloid biosynthesis. However, high activities of the enzyme are not enough to increase alkaloid production by itself. No additional cofactors are needed for strictosidine synthase to achieve optimal activity, although early studies of the enzyme derived from "Apocynaceae" plants identified p-chloromercuribenzoate as a potent inhibitor.
North-Eastern parts of the province were also inhabited by pagan Itureans, who lived in more significant numbers in the neighbouring Phoenicia and Phoenicia Libani provinces to the north. Christian Arab Ghassanids migrated to the province from Yemen in around 4th and 5th centuries and settled the Gaulanitis, as well as former territories of Arabia Petraea province, creating a buffer Byzantine client kingdom in the 6th century, with the capital on the Gaulanitis - the North-Eastern border of Palaestina Secunda.
