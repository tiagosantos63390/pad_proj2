Durham Castle is a Norman castle in the city of Durham, England, which has been wholly occupied since 1840 by University College, Durham. It is open to the general public to visit, but only through guided tours, since it is in use as a working building and is home to over 100 students. The castle stands on top of a hill above the River Wear on Durham's peninsula, opposite Durham Cathedral ().
The "Stanford Chaparral" was established in 1899 by Bristow Adams. Published for more than 112 years, the "Chappie" is the second oldest continually published humor magazine in the world after "Nebelspalter" (1875â€“present). It is the oldest continually published humor magazine in the United States, as the "Harvard Lampoon" did not publish during World War I and World War II. The magazine's most recent brush with the national media was its feature in "The New Yorker" by Evan Ratliff.
