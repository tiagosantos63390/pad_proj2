Author Richard Matheson said that his best-known work, "The Incredible Shrinking Man", was inspired by a scene in Aldo Ray's "Let's Do It Again" in which a character puts on someone else's hat and it sinks down past his ears; "I thought, what if a man put on his own hat and that happened?" he recounted in an interview for Stephen King's non fiction work "Danse Macabre". 
Kodiak bears reach sexual maturity at age five, but most sows are over nine years old when they successfully wean their first litter. The average time between litters is four years. Sows continue to produce cubs throughout their lives but their productivity diminishes after they are 20 years old. Mating season for Kodiak bears is during May and June. They are serially monogamous (having one partner at a time), staying together from two days to two weeks. As soon as the egg is fertilized and divides a few times, it enters a state of suspended animation until autumn when it finally implants on the uterine wall and begins to grow again. Cubs are born in the den during January or February. Weighing less than a pound (<450 g) at birth with little hair and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June, weighing 15–20 pounds (7–9 kg). Typical litter sizes on Kodiak are 2–3 cubs, with a long-term average of 2.4 cubs per litter. However, Kodiak bears have six functional nipples and litters of up to six cubs have been reported. Sows are sometimes seen with five or six cubs in tow, probably due to adopting cubs from other litters. Most cubs stay with their mothers for three years. Almost half of the cubs die before they leave, with cannibalism by adult males being one of the major causes of death.
In 1889 Cuyamaca Dam was completed, creating Cuyamaca Reservoir. A wooden flume, now long gone, was constructed to carry water west toward San Diego.

The results of this study show why this issue is complicated, without an obvious solution. The privately run prisons were found to be a cheaper alternative without diminishing the level of safety and generating a higher completion rate of the offered educational/vocational programs. But the publicly run prison offered more services, suggesting a larger commitment beyond guarding and housing inmates.

The bank also functions as a natural shelter for a variety of birds, enabling bird-watching.
The opposite of the Baldwin effect is 'shielding'. Modern medicine, for example, could artificially control a harmful pathogen, thus preventing any genetic immunity against it from being selected for. Here, learned behavior that improves fitness also prevents genetic adaptation.
The anecdotes were edited from taped conversations that Feynman had with his close friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton. Its surprise success led to a sequel entitled "What Do You Care What Other People Think?", also taken from Leighton's taped conversations. "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" sold more than 500,000 copies.

By the time enough theoretical evidence existed to make a business case for strategic workforce management, changes in the business landscape (à la Andrew Carnegie, John Rockefeller) and in public policy (a là Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal) had transformed the employer-employee relationship, and the discipline was formalized as "industrial and labor relations". In 1913, one of the oldest known professional HR associations—the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development—was founded in England as the "Welfare Workers' Association", then changed its name a decade later to the "Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers", and again the next decade to "Institute of Labour Management" before settling upon its current name. Likewise in the United States, the world's first institution of higher education dedicated to workplace studies—the School of Industrial and Labor Relations—was formed at Cornell University in 1945.
The blues influence would return in full force on the band's third album, "Swarm". Compared to their first studio album, the recording and production of "Swarm" were of higher quality, and sales catapulted forward. The band gained national recognition with appearances on the nationally syndicated "Jenny Jones Show". In 1999, they released their fourth album, "Babies", a largely experimental work. "Babies" notably included as a secret track an alternative version of "Florence", jokingly referred to by fans as "Florence Goes to Hell", that the band had been performing at Halloween night shows for the past few years.
Lockwood's two series came early in his career, and each lasted only a single season. ABC's Hawaii-set "Follow the Sun" (1961–62) cast him in support of Brett Halsey and Barry Coe, who played adventurous magazine writers based in Honolulu. Lockwood was Eric Jason, who did the legwork for their articles, but his on-screen time was limited since most of the plot focused on Halsey or Coe. In the story, Eric Jason was said to have been born on December 7, 1941 (Pearl Harbor Day), but Lockwood was actually born nearly five years earlier. Another series regular was Gigi Perreau, who played the writers' secretary. Lockwood had earlier played a soldier with a crush on Mary Stone (Shelley Fabares) on the ABC sitcom, "The Donna Reed Show".
The Lakers were very successful under Buss' ownership, winning ten NBA championships with such players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol, and with coaches Pat Riley and Phil Jackson. He inspired the Lakers' Showtime era with his vision that basketball games must be entertaining. The Sparks also experienced their share of success, winning two WNBA championships with such players as Lisa Leslie, Tamecka Dixon and DeLisha Milton-Jones.
