Ettore was given a leading role in "Hotel Italia", one of Lucas Kazan's classic early films. Soon after, he took on a full-time position with Lucas Kazan Productions, which led him to oversee model scouting in Italy and eventually to directing his own gay porn series: "The Road to Naples", "Maspalomas" (GayVN Award Nominated for Best Solo Video), "" (GayVN Award winner for Best Pro-Am video), "Sexcursions" (GayVN Award nominated for Best Pro-Am video), "Sexcursions 05" and an ongoing reality series for LucasKazan.com.
Construction of the fort began in the summer of 1765, and took a couple of years to complete because of structural complications as well as the constant threat of attack by the Creek Native Americans. It was named for the reigning queen at the time. The Fort was made mostly of granite quarried from across the Savannah River. The Fort measured approximately 170 foot squared with bastions at every corner and a wall height of between 10 and 20 feet. The Fort was built for defensive purposesâ€”to protect local settlers, as opposed to being a trading fort, meant for Native American/ European trading. Almost as soon as the Fort was completed the British Royal (Federal) government abandoned the Fort by placing it under the care and authority of the South Carolina government. During that time (1768) several forts were closed in the area, and in many cases guns, cannon, powder, bullets and other military supplies were sent to Fort Charlotte for safe keeping.
