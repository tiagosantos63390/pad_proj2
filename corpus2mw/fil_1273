On April 27, 2009 KHKZ started airing "On-air with Ryan Seacrest".
Originally it was part of the Kirchdorf parish, but in 1664 it joined the much nearer Gurzelen parish.

The script is an integrated series of evolutions and formations. The band first forms a triple Block O formation, then slowly unwinds to form the famous letters while playing Robert Planquette's "Le RÃ©giment de Sambre et Meuse". The drum major leads the outside O into a peel-off movement around the curves of the script, every musician in continual motion. Slowly the three blocks unfold into a long singular line which loops around, creating the OSUMB's trademark. Unlike a typical follow-the-leader drill, the Script Ohio is a very specifically measured and charted maneuver. Each band member is required to memorize the counts for each portion of the formation. Squad Leaders, as part of their tryout drills, are required to march a Script Ohio, individually, from their spot in the block to their final charted position to ensure they are counting and not just following the person in front of them. This is also required in the event that the Drum Major is incapacitated for some reason (injury, sudden illness).
