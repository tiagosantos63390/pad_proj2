It is revealed that the thing that knocked out Kanako before is a person who committed suicide and since then, Kanako had been in a coma because of the operation to remove the person's hands, which had been fused to Kanako, meaning that the previous night's events were her imagination. She also learns that Akira's ex-wife is not the presumed woman in red, but instead had been trying to tell Akira that she will remarry. Kanako visits the apartment in front of the girl's memorial where a neighbor tells her that the insane woman had committed suicide a year before by hanging. The insane woman and her daughter appear, who then disappear shortly when they try to reveal something. The set suddenly turns to night as the woman in red appears and tries to push Kanako off the balcony. Kanako realizes that the one who fell on her is herself when she sees another self of her walking on the road, meaning that the entire events had been a loop. The woman in red reveals herself as a monster before throwing Kanako to her death.
