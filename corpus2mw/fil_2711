In Central London, England, an area known as the "Elephant and Castle" (or "The Elephant") is a major road intersection and a station of the London Underground. The "Castle" in the location's name likely refers to a Howdah. The heraldic elephant and castle has also been associated with the city of Coventry, England since Medieval times where it denotes religious symbolism. More recently in Britain, Welephant, a red elephant cartoon character with a fireman's helmet, was originally used as a mascot by fire brigades in the United Kingdom to promote fire safety for children and has become the mascot for the Children's Burn Trust.
