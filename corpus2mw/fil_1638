Up to this point, the three kingdoms had operated on a very simple feudal model. Peasants were subsistence farmers who paid taxes to their local "aji" and performed various other labors and services to him; the "aji" in turn owed taxes and services to the head of their kingdom (hypothetically a king, but called a prince in many English-language texts on the subject). Shō Hashi did not effect drastic dramatic changes upon this system, but reinforced it as part of his unification efforts; "aji" were made to owe their allegiance to his royal government at Shuri, rather than becoming lordless rebels or the like upon the defeat and absorption of their kingdom. Hashi also oversaw a significant expansion of trade, particularly with China, and organized envoys to other Asian countries as well. Documents survive today chronicling a number of missions to Ayutthaya, the capital of Siam at the time, to resolve trade issues. Recognizing the importance of trade to Ryūkyū's continued prosperity, Shō Hashi promoted it strongly, and even ordered a bell cast and installed at Shuri Castle, upon which was inscribed "Ships are means of communication with all nations; the country is full of rare products and precious treasures."

In 2005 the hospital with donations and funding from the state through a grant written by board member Jimmy Gladwell, and funding from the hospital itself, paved way for a much needed helipad to help in the shipment of patients to Charleston, West Virginia, Beckley, and even Morgantown's Ruby Memorial Hospital. The helipad was a much needed addition to the aging hospital's need to provide better care.
