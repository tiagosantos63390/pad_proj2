In 149â€“150 CE, Yavanesvara translated the "Yavanajataka" ("Saying of the Greeks"), one of the earliest writings of Indian astrology, from Greek to Sanskrit:
Set 244 to avoid an innings defeat, England started badly again. Prabhakar took the wickets of the top three batsmen, reducing the visitors to 34/3, and they never really recovered despite half-centuries from Smith and Gatting, and 47 from Hick. The tail was unable to demonstrate the same resilience as in the first innings, only DeFreitas making double figures, and the Test series ended on a whimper for England when DeFreitas was stumped off Raju still sixteen runs short of making India bat a second time.

It is a well studied problem in many different models of computation. The problem may be solved by sorting the list and then checking if there are any consecutive equal elements; it may also be solved in linear expected time by a randomized algorithm that inserts each item into a hash table and compares only those elements that are placed in the same hash table cell.
