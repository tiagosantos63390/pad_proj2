Thomas is one of the most popular players in Brewers history, affectionately known as "Stormin' Gorman." Thomas hit more home runs during the period 1978–1983 than any other player in the American League, with 197.

Thomas was a premier center fielder, with a wide range and strong arm until undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1984, which limited his duties and led to his being utilized primarily as a designated hitter for the remainder of his career.
