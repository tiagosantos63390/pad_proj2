When INOS was dissolved under the Presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez the intent was to decentralize service provision to the municipalities that already had the legal responsibility for service provision. However, because of the lack of capacity and resources of most municipalities, service provision in 20 out of the 23 states was temporarily entrusted to the ten regional water companies under the holding company HIDROVEN (see above). In the remaining three states services were provided by the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG).The Pérez government also launched a bid for a private concession for the water and sanitation system of Caracas in 1992. However, the bid failed for lack of interested bidders under the proposed conditions.

Schroeder (2009) describes Schmid's work as entirely convincing; "an enormously detailed examination of Haydn's genealogy" that "put all theories to rest." He notes further, however, that the "timing of this type of study was unfortunate. Only a few years later similar genealogical studies affirming the German (and Aryan) roots of the Germanic musical giants had become a musicological preoccupation as a propaganda service to the National Socialist government ... Schmid's book pre-dates those sponsored by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and his chief ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, but it is a matter of regret that his proved to be a model for those which followed."

The HP LaserJet 4100 series were replacements for the HP LaserJet 4000/4050 series of printers. The LaserJet 4100 series printers print letter paper at 25 pages per minute, and can be set to print at 600 dpi or 1200 dpi. Unlike the 4000 and 4050 series, the 4100 series printers are capable of printing at true 1200 dpi at full engine speed. These printers may be connected to a computer using either the serial port, parallel port or Ethernet ( for the network capable "N"series" ). The LaserJet 4100 series was introduced in March 2001 and was discontinued in February 2003. The 4100MFP, however, was introduced in March 2002, and discontinued in August 2006. They are all powered by a PMC-Sierra RM5261 CPU
