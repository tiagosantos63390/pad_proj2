Lane co-wrote "If I Should Die" with Adamson, "I'm a Believer" with Cave, and "Sugar in a Hurricane" with Harvey and Katy Beale. The third track, "Lost in Music", is a cover version of Sister Sledge's 1979 single and has Cave on piano. AllMusic's Dean McFarlane describes her EP as "arresting" with the "outstanding tracks" being "If I Should Die" and "Sugar in a Hurricane", where Lane "summons the spirit of Nancy Sinatra, Nico, and Marianne Faithfull. plays the scared chanteuse role beautifully".
The Monash Freeway was extended by 7.5Â km in July 2003 when the Hallam Bypass was completed after 3 years of construction, linking the Monash Freeway to the Princes Freeway in Berwick. It opened 17 months ahead of schedule and A$10 million under budget (total cost A$165 million). This was due to the omission of one key interchange that should have linked the South Gippsland Freeway with the Hallam Bypass at Eummemmering. This omission causes unnecessary congestion on neighbouring roads as northbound South Gippsland Freeway traffic must exit the freeway at Princes Highway only to join the same freeway again from Belgrave-Hallam Road eastbound.

Alternately. the origin of the name comes from the legend of a Breton saint, Ferreol, who arrived here on a ship, amid a chorus of seven siren. Another tradition says that "Ferrol" proceeds from "farol", alluding to the heraldic figure that appears on the coat of arms of the city. However, according to experts, the origin of the arms of Ferrol goes back only to the eighteenth century, and there are also several variants used over time, without having been set in accordance with the applicable legislation since the 1990s. The combination of two words that can mean either 'port - close', 'landing on pillars' or a Ferreoli Domini, "the lord of Ferreol" veiled allusion to the town, which could have had a temple under the patronage of St. Ferreol.
