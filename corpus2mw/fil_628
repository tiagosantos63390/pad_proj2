On the death on Christmas Day 1988 of his remote kinsman, Edward Pelham-Clinton, 10th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1920â€“1988), Fiennes-Clinton inherited the earldom of Lincoln, although not the dukedom which for ten generations had gone with it. That was because he was the senior male heir to the title through his ancestor Sir Henry Clinton, of Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, third son of the 2nd Earl of Lincoln, who died in 1616, but he was not descended from the first Duke of Newcastle. His ancestors had served in public life since John de Clinton, 1st Baron Clinton had been summoned to Parliament in 1299, and in the 18th century one predecessor had twice served as Prime Minister. The barony of Clinton is also extant, but as is customary with titles created by writ of summons, it can pass through the female line, and today is held by another distant branch of the family.
