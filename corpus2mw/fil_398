Rifampin increases the clearance of nitrazepam significantly and probenecid decreases its clearance significantly. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and increased risk of accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol.

In the latter half of 1975, DeMeo became a silent partner in a peep show/prostitution establishment in New Jersey after the owner of the business became unable to pay his loansharking debts. DeMeo also began dealing in pornography, including bestiality, which he sold to his New Jersey establishment as well as connections he had in Rhode Island. When his superior Nino Gaggi found out about DeMeo's involvement in such taboo films, he ordered DeMeo to stop under the threat of death. DeMeo did not stop however and Gaggi continued to accept his weekly payments. Gaggi's nephew Dominick Montiglio claimed that the subject was simply never mentioned between the two men after the initial confrontation, and as long as DeMeo continued to provide copiously for his boss the violation of his order was never addressed.

Conacher remained in senior hockey and while playing for the North Toronto Seniors in 1923, was a part of the first hockey game ever broadcast on radio. That summer, he received an offer from Roy Schooley, the manager of the Duquesne Gardens and owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA), to play for his team. While he would retain his amateur status, Schooley set Conacher up with a job in the insurance business and paid his university tuition so that he could improve his education. He brought many of his teammates with him to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, all of whom received jobs in the community, and he attended school at Bellefonte Academy for a year before enrolling at Duquesne University.

Semester at Sea has used a number of ships as its floating campus, including the MS "Seven Seas" (formerly the USS "Long Island"), the SS "Ryndam" (not the later freighter of that name), the SS "Universe" (formerly the SS Atlantic) and the SS "Universe Explorer". One ship SAS intended to use, the S.S. "Seawise University" (formerly the RMS "Queen Elizabeth"), burned and sank in Hong Kong Harbour during its conversion into a floating campus in 1972, and consequently was never used for students. The "Universe Explorer", retired in 2005, had a structure of four main decks with a small swimming pool in the stern of the ship. The "Seawise University", "Universe", and "Universe Explorer" were supplied and managed by Tung Chao Yung's Seawise Foundation. Concerns about the split between the Institute for Shipboard Education and the Seawise Foundation as well as the safety of the MV "Explorer" contributed to the University of Pittsburgh severing ties with the program in 2005.
Publication history.
As part of independent Indonesia, Bogor began to play a significant role in the cultural, scientific and economic development of the country and West Java in particular – primarily due to the infrastructure built during the colonial period. Its special position was further reinforced by the transformation of the former summer residence of the governor-general into the summer palace of the President of Indonesia. In the 1990s–2000s, the city regularly hosted various international events, such as ministry-level meetings of the Asia-Pacific institutions and the APEC summit of 15 November 1994. Since 2008, a Christian church congregation in Bogor has been embroiled with Islamic fundamentalists over the building permit for their new church.
