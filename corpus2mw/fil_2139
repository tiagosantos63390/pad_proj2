Manuel A. Vasquez is a leading expert on religion and transnationalism in the Americas. Manuel A. VÃ¡squez received his B.S. from Georgetown University and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Temple University. He was an Andrew W. Mellon post-doctoral fellow at Wesleyan University's Center for the Americas. Vasquez's dissertation and first book, "The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity" (Cambridge University Press 1998), focused on the impact of neo-liberal capitalism on grassroots progressive Catholicism in Brazil. The book received the 1998 award for excellence in the analytical-descriptive study of religion from the American Academy of Religion. More recently, Vasquez has co-directed (with Philip J. Williams) a series of studies, supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, on the role of religion in the process of migration, settlement, and integration among Latinos in new destinations in the U.S. South. In particular, he has explored how religious congregations grapple with the challenges posed by increasing racial and ethnic diversity and transnational immigration, both authorized and unauthorized. Vasquez has also contributed to the field of method and theory, advancing a "non-reductive materialism" that stresses the centrality of embodiment, emplacement, practice, and material culture in the study of religion. He argues that religions are hybrid and dynamic artifacts produced by complex relations among discursive matrices, and social, neural, and ecological networks.
