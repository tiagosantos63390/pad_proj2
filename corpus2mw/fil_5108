Marlfield House, County Wexford is an Irish country house built in 1852 and was one of the two houses owned by the Earls of Courtown. It was a dower house on the Courtown estate and is a good example of a rural regency style house. Owning two residences was not uncommon for wealthy families during the 19th century and the Stopfords (the family name of the Earls of Courtown) were no exception. Guests regularly came to stay at both Marlfield and Courtown House, the principal family home, located some three miles from Marlfield. The Stopford family was ultimately unable to support their lavish lifestyle and Courtown House no longer exists today. Marlfield House was further improved in 1866 by James Thomas Stopford (1794-1858), fourth Earl of Courtown. The house has historic connections with James Walter Milles Stopford (1853-1933), sixth Earl of Courtown, Major James Richard Neville Stopford OBE (1877-1857), seventh Earl of Courtown, and James Montagu Burgoyne Stopford (1908-1975), eighth Earl of Courtown. It is now a hotel.
