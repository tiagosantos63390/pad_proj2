In 2007, Chuck Lorre, the creator of "Two and a Half Men", contacted Carol Mendelsohn, the show runner of "", about a crossover. The first reactions to this were that it was a stupid idea. "CSI" writer and executive producer Naren Shankar commented that when Mendelsohn first told him about the idea he replied: "What a nut". However, that same year, the idea resurfaced, when Lorre and Mendelsohn met at the World Television Festival in Banff. Upon hearing this, the cast of both shows were surprised and not interested, but they eventually jumped aboard. In an interview with "The New York Post", before the idea was fully worked out, Mendelsohn described the possible crossover as "a great challenge".
