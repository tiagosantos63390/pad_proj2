St Mary's is constructed in buff sandstone, the roof is tiled and the spire shingled. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a north chapel, a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in four stages, the lower two of which date from the 12th century, and the upper two from the following century. There are lancet windows on all but the east side, and on the south side is also a clock face. The bell openings in the top stage are paired lancets under arches.

Inside the porch are seats along the walls and a stoup.
