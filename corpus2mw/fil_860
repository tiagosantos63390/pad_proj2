Since 1993, there have been almost 8000 screenplays submitted and over 200 writers selected, 135 international advisers, and a record 65 films produced and released.

Solomon Quetsch was an Austrian rabbi and Talmudist. He was born at Nikolsburg, Moravia on October 13, 1798, and died there January 30, 1856. He was educated at the yeshiva of his native city under Mordechai Benet, and was his premier disciple. He officiated as rabbi successively at Piesling, Leipnik, and Nikolsburg. In the later city, where he succeeded Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, he officiated for only a few months. He was a traditionalist, but was distinguished by a tolerant and kindly disposition. Of his literary works only some Talmudic novellæ are known, edited under the title "Chokmat Shelomoh" in the collection "Harha-Mor" by Moses Löb Kohn (Vienna, 1862).
