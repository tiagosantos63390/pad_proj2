The earliest china dolls often depicted grown women. From approximately the 1850s on child like china dolls became popular. Blonde haired china dolls became more prevalent at the end of the 1800s. These dolls display contemporary hairstyles: sausage curls, ribbons or headbands.

In the development of MOS equations, past observations and archived NWP model forecast fields are used with a screening regression to determine the 'best' predictors and their coefficients for a particular predictand and forecast time. By using archived model forecast output along with verifying surface observations, the resulting equations implicitly take into account physical effects and processes which the underlying numerical weather prediction model cannot explicitly resolve, resulting in much better forecasts of sensible weather quantities. In addition to correcting systematic errors, MOS can produce reliable probabilities of weather events from a single model run. In contrast, despite the enormous amount of computing resources devoted to generating them, ensemble model forecasts' relative frequency of events—often used as a proxy for probability—do not exhibit useful reliability. Thus, ensemble NWP model output also requires additional post-processing in order to obtain reliable probabilistic forecasts.

According to Jungledyret fans, the cats featured in the film's appearance are similar to that of the characters from Felidae, despite having a more non-violent and quite animated (cartoony) appearance.
Bangla Bangers, later followed by sequel-series Chop Shop: London Garage, was a reality program on the Discovery Channel about eccentric and unconventional Bangladeshi coachbuilder Nizamuddin "Leepu" Awlia and foul-mouthed Cockney mechanic Bernie Fineman. In every episode they and their team attempt to build a supercar in a mere matter of weeks out of an automobile which they generally obtain from a wrecking yard.

Twelve of the victims survived the shootings and the fall into the ravine. Seven of them were found by members of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS), who filed a report on the "terrible crime against civilians," but the prisoners were not immediately released and some suffered further abuse while being treated for their wounds at the Hospital for Eye Diseases in Paprikovac. They were eventually handed over to the ICRC on 1 October.

Eight different types of Vivaah have been documented in the ancient Indian scripture "Manu Smrti" III.20-34. In all these types of marriage, an eligible groom is one who has completed his Brahmacharya Ashram (student hood) and an eligible bride is a never-married virgin who has recently attained puberty. The eight types of marriage are:

The GSO projection (named after Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joël Scherk, and David I. Olive) is an ingredient used in constructing a consistent model in superstring theory. The projection is a selection of a subset of possible vertex operators in the worldsheet conformal field theory (CFT)--usually those with specific worldsheet fermion number and periodicity conditions. Such a projection is necessary to obtain a consistent worldsheet CFT. For the projection to be consistent, the set "A" of operators retained by the projection must satisfy:

By the 20th century the major brewing firms had become very large vertically integrated businesses. They owned the breweries and ran truck fleets and distribution networks, and the major brewers owned chains of pubs across the country. The premises were typically operated on a leasehold basis by licensed publicans.
During October and November 2006, "Ipswich" was the primary ship used for filming the 13-episode Australian television drama series "Sea Patrol". "Ipswich" was rebadged as the fictional HMAS "Hammersley" (pennant number 202), and spent six weeks operating off Dunk Island with both the show's cast and her normal crew aboard. Footage of "Ipswich" at sea was mixed with scenes shot on and around sister ship while the latter was docked in Sydney.

Hiking is more than great exercise - it's also a terrific way to see the world. Here are the basics of long distance walking.

The series consisted of 26 episodes of 5 minutes duration. It was filmed using stop-motion with origami figures and was written and directed by Francesco Misseri with music by Piero Barbetti. Quaq Quao was produced by L + H Films in 1978. It was first broadcast in Italy in 1980 
In 2007, a group of rabbis led by Adin Steinsalz and supported by the Temple Mount Faithful and the New Sanhedrin Council identified a Kohen who was a butcher, made plans for conducting a passover sacrifice on the Temple Mount, and petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice for permission. The Court sided with the government and rejected the request, holding that such an event would inflame religious tensions and would threaten security. The incident was a successor to a series of earlier attempts by various groups to perform such a sacrifice, either openly or by subterfuge.

Rumiko Fujikawa first appeared in the pages of "The Invincible Iron Man" vol. 3 #4 (May 1998) while Iron Man (Tony Stark) battles Firebrand on the island of Isla Suerte. The daughter of Kenjiro Fujikawa, the man who had taken over Stark's company during his stay in the Heroes Reborn universe, she begins to date Stark largely as an act of rebellion to parents who disapproved of Stark.

The species is native from Pennsylvania westward to Illinois, and north of Georgia. However, "F. rubra" is fairly successful as an alien species in places such as Massachusetts, where it was first recorded in 1875 and is still found. In many places where it is native, such as Indiana, and places where it is alien as well, "F. rubra" is a threatened species.

She has served on the editorial board for a number of scholarly journals, including "Feminist Studies," "Politics and Society," the "American Journal of Sociology," "Gender and Society," "International Labor and Working-Class History," "Contemporary Sociology," the "British Journal of Industrial Relations," "Industrial Relations" and "Work and Occupations."
Hill began his career with Blackburn Rovers, moving on to Plymouth Argyle in 1992 in a joint deal with Craig Skinner, with Nicky Marker moving in the opposite direction. Hill spent four years with Plymouth, moving on to Rochdale in 1996. After five years at Spotland, he joined Cheltenham Town, but he only spent a year there, playing only five games, punctuated by a two-month loan with Wrexham. He then spent a year with Football Conference side Morecambe.
