Chris Dodge rejoined on second guitar, and they released their second album "Don't Miss the Train" in 1992 before signing up with Fat Mike's label Fat Wreck Chords in 1993. During this year Chris Dodge left the line-up, and was replaced with guitarist Robin Pfefer, who took over on lead guitar so Sly could concentrate on singing and stick to rhythm. No Use for a Name also released their first record on Fat that year, "The Daily Grind", which turned out to be a highly successful album.
