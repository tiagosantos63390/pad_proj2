Since the mid-1990s, Russian, Uzbek, Kazakh, and Philippine women have worked as prostitutes in U.S. military camp towns in South Korea. Reportedly many of them have been forced into prostitution. Since the 2000s, the majority of prostitutes have been Philippine or Russian women, and South Koreans have become less numerous. Since the mid-1990s, foreigners make up 80-85 percent of the women working at clubs near military bases. Between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s nearly 5,000 women from Russia and the Philippines have been smuggled into South Korea and forced into sexual slavery. On the other hand, South Korean prostitutes are still represented in large numbers. According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, South Korean prostitutes numbered about 330,000 in 2002. As the number was rising, the Ministry estimates that about 500,000 women work in the national sex industry. The Korean Feminist Association estimates the actual number may exceed one million. According to the estimates up to one-fifth of women between the ages of 15 and 29 have worked in the sex industry. South Korean government also admits sex trade accounts for as much as 4 percent of the annual Gross Domestic Product. In August 1999, a Korean club owner in Tongduchon was accused of trafficking in women by bringing more than 1,000 Philippine and Russian women into South Korea for U.S. military bases, but a South Korean judge overturned the warrant. In 2000, five foreign women locked in a brothel died in a fire in Gunsan. In early 2002, 12 women died in a similar fire, also locked in a Gunsan pub.
