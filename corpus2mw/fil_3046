Early career.

Plot is the core of a play. “Aristotle considered it to be the most important play element of them all." There are two things to remember about the plot – selection and arrangement. Selection pertains to what the playwright decides to actually write about. S/he never decides to tell every facet of the story, but instead chooses important parts that not only progress the story but are also connected to dramatic action. Arrangement pertains to how the playwright wants the story to be told. There are many ways to tell a story, such as starting from the ending and then showing the audience how the characters reached that conclusion, it’s all up to the playwright to see what order will do the most justice to the story.

In January 1862, William Dole, U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asked Native American agents to "engage forthwith all the vigorous and able-bodied Native Americans in their respective agencies." The request resulted in the assembly of the 1st and 2nd Indian Home Guard. Many Native American tribes fought in the war including: the Delaware, Creek, Cherokee, Seminole, Kickapoo, Seneca, Osage, Shawnee, Choctaw, Lumbee, Chickasaw, Iroquois, Powhatan, Pequot, Ojibwe (Chippewa), Huron, Odawa, Potawatomi, Catawba, and Pamunkey. The Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Catawba, and Creek tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. Like other American communities, some tribes had members fighting on either side of the war. The majority of the Creek sided with the Union as two-thirds of the people preferred to be guided by the advice of their chief Opothleyahola. Ex-Chief McIntosh was bought by the South, whose leaders appointed him a colonel in the Confederate Army. During November 1861, the Creek, Black Creek Indians, and White Creek Indians of their tribe were led by Creek Chief Opothleyahola, fought three pitched battles (Battle of Round Mountain), and the Battle of Chustenahlah against Confederate white troops and other Native Americans that joined the Confederates to reach Union lines in Kansas, and offer their services.
