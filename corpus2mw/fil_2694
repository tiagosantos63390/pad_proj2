There was no fixed process for papal selection before 1059. Popes, the bishops of Rome and the leaders of the Catholic Church, were often appointed by their predecessors or secular rulers. While the process was often characterized by some capacity of election, an election with the meaningful participation of the laity was the exception to the rule, especially as the popes' claims to temporal power solidified into the Papal States. The practice of papal appointment during this period would later give rise to the "jus exclusivae", a veto right exercised by Catholic monarchies into the twentieth century.

Released on 15 December 1984, the single coincided with a much-publicised coach crash the group experienced earlier in the week. While the group were returning from a gig in Newcastle, their tour bus collided with road works and careened off the road and injured the members of the group as well their entourage. Member Mike Nolan was badly injured and the group were inactive for several months. As a result of this, promotion for the single was minimal and the song failed to chart as highly as had been expected, reaching No.34 in the UK Charts, despite it being seen as one of their strongest ever songs by fans. Reviewing the single for "Number One" magazine, pop group Bananarama made positive comments about the song, saying that it had "something that their last few singles didn't". Member Cheryl Baker has also commented that it is one of her favourite Bucks Fizz songs.
Azerbaijan and Greece announced professional dance couples as their representatives at the Eurovision Dance Contest 2008. According to the regulations of the contest, professional couples were not allowed to take part in the competition. The EBU specified that the couple had to be composed of one professional (defined as a dancer who earns his or her living through dance and dance-related activities), and one non-professional known in a field other than dance. The non-professional was not required to be a celebrity, as long as he or she was known in his field, and it was also not a requirement that the non-professional had no dance experience. Since the representatives for Azerbaijan and Greece both consisted of two professional dancers, however, it is not clear why their entries were considered valid.
