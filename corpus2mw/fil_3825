A main point critics attributed to the song was its ability to be kid-friendly, yet appeal to all music listeners, with Gerrick Kennedy of "The Los Angeles Times" calling the song radio, club, and recess-friendly, and Daniela Capistrano of MTV News calling it a "kid-friendly club banger". Kennedy commented, "don't let her age fool you; the song packs serious punch." Capistrano said that the song's "crazy" beat works on the schoolyard and dancefloor. Commenting that the song was age-appropriate, Gina Serpe of E! Online said, that accomplishment was commendable, stating, "it's got to be a bit of a battle finding material suitable for someone still in the single-digits." Tim Stack of "Entertainment Weekly" commended the song, complimenting the production value, stating the song was "Lil Mama meets Rihanna". CBC said while the song may not be deep, it was the best to be expected from a "fourth grade fashionista", commenting the track was more "schoolyard friendly" than any music released by Miley Cyrus. "The Guardian" described the track as "a pretty good R&B belter in the same vein as Rihanna, all heavily treated vocals and huge juddering beats". BET Sound Off blog commented that Smith had more personality on the track than fellow artists three times her age. Bill Lamb of About.com said that the song was "not only quality music for a nine year old, but it is also solid, catchy R&B / pop that will appeal to a wide range of music fans". Melinda Newman of HitFix complimented Smith's "competent" singing voice.
