Light locomotives mainly used diesel motors (originally classified as "Kö/Köf/Köe" by the DRG), as their source of energy, but there were also versions with Benzolmotors, designated as "Kb/Kbf/Kbe", and with electrical batteries (accumulator cars: "Ks/Ka"), as well as one locomotive with a steam engine. The third letter indicated the type of power transmission. If there wasn't one, the locomotive had a gear system. An "f" stood for an hydraulic drive and an "e" for electric traction motors, that were fed by a generator. Köf, therefore, stood for a light locomotive ("Kleinlok") with diesel ("Öl-(Diesel-)Motor") engine and hydraulic transmission ("Flüssigkeitsgetriebe").
