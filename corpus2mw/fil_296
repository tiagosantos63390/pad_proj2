Dulbecco and his group demonstrated that the infection of normal cells with certain types of viruses (oncoviruses) led to the incorporation of virus-derived genes into the host-cell genome, and that this event lead to the transformation (the acquisition of a tumor phenotype) of those cells. As demonstrated by Temin and Baltimore, who shared the Nobel Prize with Dulbecco, the transfer of viral genes to the cell is mediated by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (or, more precisely, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), which replicates the viral genome (in this case made of RNA) into DNA, which is later incorporated in the host genome.

The first known imprint of the press is John D. Rockefeller's "Random Reminiscences of Men and Events." In the earliest years, M&S concentrated primarily on exclusive distribution and printing agreements with foreign-owned publishing houses. But the company did feature home-grown authors alongside their foreign offerings - the second catalogue issued by the company was titled "Canadiana: A list of Books on Canada and Canadian Questions, Books by Canadian Writers."

In 1816 Dubourg paid their passage to America and they sailed to in Baltimore, Maryland, then traveled by flatboat to Bardstown, Kentucky, where they were welcomed by the local bishop, Benedict Joseph Flaget. The two Italians taught theology at St. Thomas Seminary there, while they perfected their knowledge of the English language and adapted to life on the new continent. Dubourg himself returned to the United States on 4 September 1817, accompanied by a large group of priests and religious Order members, also landing in Baltimore. From there he sent a request to Flaget that he accompany the two Vincentian priests to St. Louis to prepare the groups' arrival.

Betty Jo was portrayed by Paul Henning's daughter, Linda Kaye Henning (billed as Linda Kaye for the first five seasons) for the entire run. However, the actresses portraying her sisters changed over the years. Billie Jo was originally going to be played by Sharon Tate; however, CBS decided not to use her when she posed scantily clad for some photos. There was a cast photo taken with Sharon Tate, but she was replaced just before the show began. Billie Jo was played for the first two years (1963–1965) by Jeannine Riley, who left to pursue a movie career; in season three (1965–1966), to be replaced by Gunilla Hutton; and for the rest of the show's run (1966–1970) by Meredith MacRae. Bobbie Jo was played in the first two years (1963–1965, but absent some episodes) by Pat Woodell, who left the series to start a singing career, and then (1965–1970) by Lori Saunders. (Woodell and Saunders resembled each other physically, but the character of Bobbie Jo was gradually revamped after the cast change, going from shy bookworm to humorous scatterbrain.) In Pat Woodell's absence, Bobbie Jo was partially played by a double - who did not show her face - in two episodes. The only cast members who were in all seasons were Edgar Buchanan, Linda Kaye Henning and Frank Cady; Buchanan was the only one to appear in every episode, with Henning appearing in all but one.
The library contains mainly old books in manuscript chained to their places, some of them fine specimens of ancient handwriting, containing beautiful illustrations in gold and colour. Two of the most valuable are a unique copy of the ancient Hereford antiphonary of the 13th century, in good preservation, and the Hereford Gospels, a copy of the Gospels at least a thousand years old, in Anglo-Saxon characters. Another treasure is an ancient reliquary of oak, bequeathed to the cathedral by Canon Russell, who is said to have obtained it from a Roman Catholic family in whose possession it had long been. It is covered with copper plates overlaid with Limoges enamel representing the murder and entombment of St. Thomas of Canterbury.
Robert Connolly, director of the 2009 film, said, "It's quite clear the journalists were murdered. The current Indonesian and Australian (government) point of view, that they were killed in crossfire, is quite frankly absurd. We seek out war criminals from World War II, so to dismiss calls for justice for the Balibo Five is crazy."

The Grande Punto in India went through a facelift changing the front face and a revised rear and giving it an aggressive look (inspired from the avventura CUV) and was named as Punto Evo. Although its names evo id doesnot share the Multi-air engines of its European brothers.The Indian version also sports an SUV-like ground clearance of 185mm for diesels and 195mm for petrols to suit Indian roads..
Alexius advanced from Salonica and pitched camp on the river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaeologus, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaeologus, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexius, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, while they were still besieging the city. Alexius moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.
After liberation, Denmark ratified the Kauffmann treaty but began efforts to take over U.S. installations. Nonetheless, in summer 1946, the radio and weather station was enhanced with a gravel airstrip and an upper-air (balloon) observatory. This was part of an American-Canadian initiative to construct joint weather stations in the High Arctic. This station was under joint U.S.-Danish operation. The location changed from the civilian village at Thule (Dundas) to mainland Pittufik. In 1946–1951, the airstrip played an important role in Arctic resupply, aerial mapping, research, and search-and rescue.

During medieval times, the Ilidža area was part of the Bosnian province of "Vrhbosna". "Katera", one of the two original Bosnian towns mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in De Administrando Imperio, was found on the ground of today's Ilidža municipality. The disciples of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius considered the area important enough to stop by Vrelo Bosne and build a church in the area.
