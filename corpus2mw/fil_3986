BirdLife Cyprus is a partner in two projects: the LIFE Oroklini project for the restoration and management of the Oroklini Lake, in which it has a coordinating role, and the ‘GYPAS’ Project for the recovery of the extremely reduced Cypriot population of Griffon Vultures, carried out under the Cross-border Cooperation Programme Greece-Cyprus (2007-2013).

The NASA Ames research center experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit (1988), had a flexibility rating of 95%, compared to what movements are possible while not wearing the suit. It is composed of gasketed hard shell sections joined with free-rotating mechanical bearings that spin around as the person moves.
