History.
The investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent John McCammont of West Mercia Police, and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces. Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all be the work of the same individual. Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, both of whom were found strangled near motorways. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Celine's murder with any other investigations." He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift to Figard before coming to England: "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced."
