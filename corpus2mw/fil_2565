<br>These schemes have been heavily criticised as they do not prevent or reduce sewage outflow into the river, and, with resumed building, outflow and pollution will increase.

"Digital Spy" gave the song a positive review: "A really good video can make you realise a song's better than you originally thought - a case in point being the new Pink single. Within the context of her Funhouse album, 'Please Don't Leave Me' seemed like a quite good angsty break-up song - one of many quite good angsty break-up songs on there - but after watching the Misery-inspired promo it becomes something far more memorable. "I can be so mean when I wanna be, I am capable of really anything," sings Pink here, one of several lines that resonate harder once you've seen her brandishing a golf club, chucking her invalid boyfriend out of his wheelchair and chasing him round the house with an axe. Still, entertaining as the video is, it's Pink's bruised vocals - which convey the combination of bitterness and regret in her lyrics perfectly - that leave the biggest impression".
