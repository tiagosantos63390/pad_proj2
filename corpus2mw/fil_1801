In the ladies' event, Stephanie Westerfeld had a narrow lead over Laurence Owen after the compulsory figures and performed well enough in the free skating that she might have won the competition. However, Owen followed with a superior effort in the free skate and won the title on a 4-1 split of the first-place ordinals. The men's competition was won by Bradley Lord, likewise in a come-from-behind victory in the free skating after having been second to Gregory Kelley in the compulsory figures. Maribel Owen and Dudley Richards, the silver medalists from the previous year, were the clear winners of the pairs event, while Diane Sherbloom and Larry Pierce -- skating in their first season together—took the ice dance championship.
