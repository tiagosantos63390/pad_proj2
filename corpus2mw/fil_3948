The Stampe et Vertongen RSV.26/100, RSV.18/100, RSV.26/18, and SV.18 were a family of two-seat touring aircraft designed by Alfred Renard and built by Stampe et Vertongen in Belgium in the 1920s and under license by Gates Aircraft in the United States as the Gates Convertiplane. Originally designed as a biplane, a monoplane version soon followed, and the aircraft was eventually marketed as convertible between the two configurations. Sometimes described as a lightened version of the RSV.26/140 military trainer, the RSV.26/100 was actuaslly a fresh design.

Early examples soon used girder stays to support the inner firebox crown. These are iron girders spanning the length or width, on the outside of the inner firebox (i.e. in the water space). The crown sheet is bolted to these. The force on the ends of the girder stays is supported by the ends or sides of the "inner" firebox. The upper part of the boiler barrel is unconnected to the firebox. This has the advantage that a large hole may be cut in the boiler directly above the firebox, to mount the steam dome.
