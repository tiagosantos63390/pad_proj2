The crystalline structure of silicon oxynitride is built by SiN3O tetrahedra connected through oxygen atoms along the "c" axis and through nitrogen atoms perpendicular to it. The strong covalent bonding of this structure results in high flexural strength and resistance to heating and oxidation up to temperatures of about 1600 Â°C.
