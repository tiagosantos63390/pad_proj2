In late March 2007, Mr. Autrey sued a lawyer and his Hollywood agent, alleging they tricked him into signing a "one-sided" contract. The lawyer, Diane Kleiman, says Mr. Autrey signed the contract willingly and is trying to get out of the contract because he wants to work with someone else. According to the Associated Press, the contract between Autrey and Kleiman (which Autrey says he signed without reading) gives Kleiman (1) exclusive rights to Autrey's name and ownership of his story, and (2) 50% of Autrey's earnings. The lawsuit was settled later that year with the contract voided.
