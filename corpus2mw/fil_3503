On 21 October 1537, in Kreuznach, Marie married Frederick of Simmern (b. 1515), later Elector Palatine (1559â€“1576). The marriage was happy. Marie, who is described as intelligent and religious, influenced her Catholic husband toward Protestantism. In 1546, Frederick finally adopted Lutheranism and assumed the administration of the Franconian territories from his brother-in-law Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Since their family was living in reduced circumstances, Marie repeatedly turned to her uncle Albert of Prussia for financial assistance.

MD 249 begins south of the state highway's intersection with Sheaffer Road on St. George Island. Piney Point Road continues as a county highway toward the southern end of the island. Just north of its terminus, MD 249 begins to closely parallel a riprap along the Potomac River side of the island. The state highway passes along a narrow point of the island where St. George's Creek briefly parallels the northbound side of the highway. MD 249 temporarily leaves the immediate coastline before crossing over a strait between St. George's Creek and the Potomac River on the St. George Island Bridge.
