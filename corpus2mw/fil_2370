Studies have investigated the efficacy of alpha-GPC for cognitive disorders including stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. An Italian multicentre clinical trial on 2,044 patients suffering from recent stroke were supplied alpha-GPC in doses of 1,000 mg/day for 28 days and 400 mg three times per day for the five ensuing months. The trial confirmed the therapeutic role of alpha-GPC on the cognitive recovery of patients based on four measurement scales, three of which reached statistical significance. Commonly used doses are 300 to 1,200 mg daily.

On August 19, 2011, a ≥3.6 Earth-mass planet was discovered using HARPS that is "just inside" the habitable zone, along with the planets of 82 G. Eridani and HR 7722 c. The planet could be potentially cool enough to host liquid water if the planet exhibits more than 50% cloud coverage. HD 85512 b is currently the fifth best candidate for habitability according to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog.
"Aspasia lunata" is primarily epiphyte on thick stems but often is found living over rock grooves covered by fallen leaves and humid forests where they never are exposed to straight sunlight. "Aspasia variegata" is found in open forests both in dry and flooded lands, then often on branches of the trees hanging over the waters.
