On November 15, 2002, Microsoft launched its Xbox Live online gaming service, allowing subscribers to play online Xbox games with other subscribers around the world and download new content directly to the system's hard drive. The online service works only with a broadband Internet connection. Approximately 250,000 subscribers signed up within two months of Xbox Live's launch. In July 2004, Microsoft announced that Xbox Live had reached 1 million subscribers; in July 2005, membership reached two million, and by July 2007 there were more than 3 million subscribers. By May 2009, the number had ballooned to 20 million current subscribers. On February 5, 2010, Marc Whitten posted on gamerscoreblog that Xbox Live support for the original Xbox games would be discontinued as of April 14, 2010. Services were discontinued on schedule, but a group of 20 gamers continued to play for almost a month afterwards by simply leaving their consoles on connected to "Halo 2". APACHE N4SIR was the final user to play on the original Xbox's Live Service and was finally disconnected on May 11, 2010, at 01:58 EDT (UTC−4).

The Navy decided that completion of "Henry Eckford" as an oiler was no longer necessary, and considered converting her into an ammunition ship, but the conversion was found to be cost-prohibitive. Instead, the nearly complete "Henry Eckford" was turned over to the Maritime Administration and towed up the James River in Virginia, where she remained in reserve in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as part of the United States Navy's James River Reserve Fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia. She was struck from the Navy List on 10 November 1997, and her title was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 2 February 1998. She and "Benjamin Isherwood" were the only units of the 18-ship "Henry J. Kaiser" class not to be completed.

Biography.

The American Evangelical Christian Churches is a denomination founded in 1944, with the aim of 'Security with Liberty', enabling orthodox Christian evangelical ministers the opportunity to minister without particular decrees about non-essential Christian doctrines. The denomination is unique in that it recognizes dual ordination status with most other mainline Christian denominations. The denomination is attracting members of 'Generation X' and 'Generation Y' Christians who seek professional ministerial status after having grown up in an 'nondenominational' or 'interdenominational' church culture. The AECC ordains both female and male ministers called by God for service in the world.

After the death of Bishop McMullen, Cosgrove was named administrator of the see. His name was not on the terna that was sent to the Holy See for Davenport's new bishop. There were still resentments about Davenport as a see city instead of Des Moines and its supporters saw an opportunity. Father Trevis, who championed Davenport as the see city and had friends at the Holy See, interceded and suggested no appointment be made until the clergy of the diocese had their say. The clergy desired one of their own as bishop, and chose Cosgrove. A petition was sent to Rome. Henry Cosgrove was appointed the second bishop of Davenport on July 11, 1884 by Pope Leo XIII, and was consecrated in St. Margaret's Cathedral on September 14, 1884 by Archbishop Patrick Feehan of Chicago. Bishops John Hennessy of Dubuque and James O'Connor, the Vicar Apostolic of Nebraska, were the principal co-consecrators.
