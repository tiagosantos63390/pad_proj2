The future of the Fraternity is in the hands of its members. Edgar Friedrichs, Beta Sigma Psi's first national president, once observed that "Beta Sigma Psi was organized as a means of serving the Church -- as a means to the end. Let us therefore be vigilant lest the means become an end in itself."
In 1909, Khalil Sakakini founded the Dusturiyyah school, which became known for its Arab nationalist approach. Sakakini pioneered an progressive education system: no grades, prizes or punishments for the students, and emphasis being placed on music education and athletics. He also introduced new methods of teaching Arabic, and made it the primary language of instruction instead of the Turkish. Sakakini led a movement to reform and change into a more Arab approach to what he considered to be a corrupt Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, and wrote a pamphlet in 1913 titled "The Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine", which led to his excommunication from the Greek Orthodox Church. Ottoman authorities arrested him on the last day of the Ottoman Rule in 1917 after he had sheltered a Polish-American Jew and fellow citizen of Jerusalem, Alter Levine. Both were sent to a prison in Damascus. Levine became an enemy when the United States joined the Allies of World War I. Even so, Alter Levine and Khalil Sakakini became close friends during their incarceration. Upon his release, Sakakini boarded for a brief time with Musa Alami, a former pupil, and then joined the Arab Revolt, for which he composed its anthem.
