A hand woven textile sling was collected by Loud in 1912 but it was not reported or studied extensively until years later. Archaeologists are interested in the specific specimen because it is recognized as one of the earliest slings in North America. The Indians of the Northern Paiute or Paviotso were occupants of the area during historic times and they recognized the sling as a toy or used for hunting and war. Slings were known to serve different purposes such as a toy, a forehead band, or a mechanism for hunting birds. The design of the sling found at Lovelock was constructed through a simple knotting technique from a two-ply yarn. The pattern on the sling is reversible. It was likely made from various pieces of available fiber. The sling found at Lovelock is just one of the many handmade textile items of the cave. Traps and nets were also crafted to assist hunters during their search for food. Baskets and other food storage items were used to ensure that during times of resource scarcity everyone would have enough food for survival.

The north-western corner of the parish is at the A1500 junction with the A15, at a roundabout. The boundary follows "Horncastle Lane" eastwards where it neighbours Welton, to the north. At Dunholme, it follows southwards across the old runways of RAF Dunholme Lodge, of which the western end was in Grange de Lings. It briefly meets Scothern, and a small section of the parish extends between Scothern and Nettleham, to meet the A46, which it follows for around 200 metres. The boundary with Nettleham passes westwards, then south-west across "Hall Lane", then meets Riseholme, where it follows a line due west to the A15 (Ermine Street), meeting South Carlton just south of the pylons across the A15. The western boundary of the parish is the A15, and just north of Watering Dyke Houses, it meets North Carlton at the perimeter fence of the Lincolnshire Showground (wholly outside the parish).

Because lack of specific approval treatment for PE in the US and some other countries, other SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and citalopram have been used as off label drugs to treat PE. Waldinger’s meta analysis shows that the use of these conventional antidepressants increasing IELT from two to ninefold above base line in comparison of three to eightfold when dapoxetine is used. However, these SSRIs must be taken daily in order to achieve meaningful efficacy, and the long half-life increases the risk of the drug accumulation and as a consequence increased of adverse effects such as decreasing sexual libido and causing erectile dysfunction. Dapoxetine, on the other hand, is a fast-acting SSRI. It is rapidly absorbed and eliminated from the body within a few hours. This favorable pharmacokinetics minimizes the risk of the drug’s accumulation in the body, and therefore reducing side effects.
