Mates uses the case study of the North East to test assumptions about the British response to the Civil War, and argues that the popular front strategy pursued by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was inadequate and a distraction from the need to end the policy of non-intervention. He also contends with the "popular frontist" assumption that the popular front was the best means available for British people to support the Spanish Republic, instead arguing that direct action in the form of mass strikes would have been more successful in placing pressure on the British government to intervene. The popular front strategy, Mates writes, was "inimical to providing the Spanish Republic with what it needed to fight Franco".
