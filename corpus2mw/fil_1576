In many of those conflicts, the bright red tunics worn by British infantry regiments had proved to be a liability, especially when faced by enemies armed with new rifles firing smokeless cartridges (this had been exacerbated by the white carrying equipment worn by the line infantry, the cross straps of which formed an X on the soldier's chest). The term "Khaki" (Urdu for "dust") had come from India and was used to describe the 'Drab' uniform first worn in 1848 by the Corps of Guides which had been raised in December 1846 as the brain-child of Sir Henry Lawrence (1806–1857) Resident at Lahore, and Agent to the Governor-General for the North-West Frontier. Lawrence chose as its commandant Sir Harry Lumsden supported by William Stephen Raikes Hodson as Second-in-Command, to begin the process of raising the Corps of Guides for frontier service, from British Indian recruits at Peshawar. Initially the border troops were dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pajama trousers, made of a coarse home-spun cotton and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. For the first year (1847) no attempt was made at uniformity; in 1848 Lumsden and Hodson decided to introduce a drab (khaki) uniform which Hodson commissioned his brother in England to send them - as recorded in Hodson's book of published letters: "Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India" (first published in 1859). It was only at a later date, when supplies of drab (khaki) material was unavailable, did they improvise by dying material locally with a dye. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857 many British regiments took to staining their white tropical uniforms with tea leaves or other makeshift dyes in order to camouflage them. Rifle regiments had long used dark green uniforms (with blackened badges, buttons, and carrying equipment) as camouflage and some units of the Volunteer Force London Regiment had adopted Hodden grey uniforms for the same purpose. Numerous khaki uniforms were adopted by units in the field over the turn of the century but the standardised Service Dress uniform was not adopted until after the Second Boer War.

On 11 November 1918, Emperor Charles I of Austria relinquished power and, on 12 November, the ethnic German areas of the empire were declared the Republic of German Austria, with the intent of unifying with the German Reich. The Province of German Bohemia was formed from the part of Bohemia that contained primarily ethnic Germans (however, ethnic German areas of southwestern Bohemia in the Bohemian Forest were added to Upper Austria instead of German Bohemia). The capital of the province was at Reichenberg.

The riot occurred because Electrica (electricity provider) decided to cut the electricity of some blocks, due to energy theft and consumer debts. However, whole blocks were cut the electricity, including few consumers without debts. In those blocks there was no central heating and people were using electric radiators (which are energy inefficient). There were also some apartments with air conditioners, so the total debts (not including the stolen energy) rose to €400,000. The stolen energy was estimated to €430,000 per month.
Toni & The Finish announced that they will do a very special "warm up" show at the Gaelic Club Surry Hills on the 5/7/2007 for the basis to have fun before Live Earth. This also was the mark of Glenn Richards on guitar reuniting with the band to perform live as on the band's Look Up tour Richards was unable to tour with them because of recording commitments with Augie March. This warm-up show sold out the Gaelic club and got a very positive reaction from the crowd.
The novel was generally well-received by critics. A reviewer for "The New York Times" said that "Burger's Daughter" is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel", and a review in "The New York Review of Books" described the style of writing as "elegant", "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class". A critic in "The Hudson Review" had mixed feelings about the book, saying that it "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless". "Burger's Daughter" won the Central News Agency Literary Award in 1980.

Nymphidius is significant not only because he played an instrumental part in the downfall of Nero, but also because he illustrates the heights to which even men of low birth could rise on their own initiative, as well as the tremendous importance of Praetorian loyalty for imperial succession in the turbulent Year of the Four Emperors which followed the death of Nero.

Biography.

In 1846, the Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway (FP&WRR) Company was set up. It had an ambitious plan to link Fleetwood on the Lancashire coast to Leeds and Bradford in Yorkshire. It would link the existing Preston and Wyre Joint Railway to the Longridge line in Preston, and build a new line from via Ribchester, Hurst Green and Clitheroe to Skipton, where it would join the proposed Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway. The line would give Lancashire passengers access to the spa towns of Harrogate and Knaresborough, and beauty spots such as Bolton Abbey. Reciprocally, it would give Yorkshire passengers access to the seaside resorts of Fleetwood and Blackpool. Freight trains would carry cattle from Craven Valley, and stone from quarries near Clitheroe as well as from Longridge. Stonyhurst College would be within a mile of the line and would be able to use it to bring in supplies as well as pupils.

In 2011 the European Court of Human Rights declared admissible two complaints of relatives of the massacre victims against Russia concerning adequacy of the official investigation. In a ruling on 16 April 2012, the court found that Russia had violated the rights of victims' relatives by not providing them with sufficient information about the investigation and described the massacre as a "war crime". However, it also refused to judge the effectiveness of the Soviet-Russian investigation because the related events took place prior to Russia ratifying the Human Rights Convention in 1998. The plaintiffs filed an appeal, however the October 21, 2013 ruling essentially reaffirmed the previous one, noting that Russian courts failed to adequately substantiate why some critical information remained classified.
