In 2012, InTeGrate ("a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.
Michael Speier from "Variety" magazine called it "clever and touching" with "fresh" stories and praised chemistry between Ted Danson and Shelley Long. Jonathan Boudreaux from the website "TVDVDReviews.com" wrote, "the episodes are often outrageously funny, the show's humor is character-based. The laughs arrive from the personalities and foibles of the group rather than from wacky situations." He also wrote, ""Cheers" is probably one of the best TV series of all time." Elizabeth Skipper from "DVD Verdict" rated the story 90 percent and acting 95 percent and wrote, "[there's nothing terribly unique about the series; it's ...  fueled by the sexual tension between the two leads and fanned by a well-rounded supporting cast, a portrayal of the attempts of a downtown boy to win over an uptown girlit's all been done before." Matt Brighton from "Blu-ray Authority" called the season's writing and directing "clever" and was "impressed at how this show has stood the test of time." "TV Guide" called "The Tortelli Tort" a "classic episode".
