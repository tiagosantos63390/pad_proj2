The project funding was exceeded in a day, and quickly grew over $100,000 within a few days of its launch. To encourage additional funding, Preston created new stretch goals, including additional game play modes, more bosses and characters, and expanding the release to include the PlayStation 4 and Vita, the Ouya, and the Wii U consoles. These goals were all met by the completion of the campaign, with more than $640,000 raised. Preston stated that he had had these additional platforms in mind when first launching the Kickstarter, but did not want to overpromise what he felt he could deliver. The additional funds have helped Preston hire additional developers to aid in porting the game to these additional consoles.

In Tyler, Texas, he met and soon married in 1922 Annabell Estes (1894-1956). Back in Winnfield, he was sales manager for the Southern Minerals Company until the company quarry was sold in 1923. Harley and Annabell Bozeman had two children, Helen Gayle Bozeman Fausett (1923-2007) of Oklahoma City and Estes Bernard Bozeman (1926-2007) of Winnfield. Estes Bozeman, like his father a tree farmer and weather observer, died some three months prior to his sister's passing.

Upon his most heinous attempt to take control, Levistus tried to subsume Bensozia, Asmodeus's consort whom he thought knew very well her master's weaknesses. At that time, Bensozia was leading a routine inspection of the layers with her pit-fiend escort and Asmodeus's constable, Martinet. While they were travelling across Stygia, Levistus ambushed them and proposed that the Queen of Hell become his consort if she helped him depose Asmodeus. The staunch queen refused harshly and passed him by. Infuriated, the Lord of the Fifth killed Bensozia and her pit-fiend bodyguards while Martinet managed to escape.
