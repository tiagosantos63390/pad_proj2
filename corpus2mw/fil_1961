The Dragon Lady first appeared in 1934 in the first Sunday strip story. She began as a stereotypically beautiful, seductive and evil Asian, but as the comic strip became more realistic, the character grew more complex. Fans of the strip recall her passionate love for Pat Ryan, and the time she taught Terry how to dance. In the years leading up to World War II, she became a heroic though Machiavellian figure leading the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China.
