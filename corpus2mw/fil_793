In 1988, Lane had become so frustrated with Warner's handling of the Executives' contract that when Claypool asked him to recommend a replacement for Primus' recently departed drummer Tim "Curveball" Wright, Lane accepted the position himself. Claypool, Lane, and guitarist Todd Huth played together as Primus for about eight months, and recorded a demo tape named "Sausage". At the end of 1988, the Freaky Executives' deal looked to be taking a turn for the better, and as Claypool was ready for Primus to start touring, Lane decided he no longer had time for both projects and chose to leave Primus, and also left the Freaky Executives after their record deal was shelved.

Since William Rutherford was a very capable mathematician, his motive for requesting a proof of a theorem that he could certainly have proved himself is unknown. Maybe he posed the question as a challenge to his peers, or perhaps he hoped that the responses would yield a more elegant solution.
