In early 2012, Aditya joined Sanjay Leela Bhansali as an assistant director for the producer/director's next directorial venture, Ram Leela. Aditya used to sing all the scratch versions of the songs. When Sanjay heard Aditya's scratch recording of the song 'Tattad Tattad' which was originally slated to be rendered by his father Udit Narayan, he was so impressed that Sanjay decided to retain Aditya's voice for the song. He also made him sing another song for Ram Leela, 'Ishqaun Dhishqyaun'. Both, the music & movie received a positive response from critics and audiences alike. 'Tattad Tattad' became a chart buster, garnering more than 5 million views on YouTube
At the start of Narváez's voyage the "Santa Saturnina" passed Admiralty Inlet, the entrance to Puget Sound (called "Ensenada de Caamaño" by the Spanish). Narváez saw that it was a large channel leading to the south and planned to explore it after returning from the north. But the Strait of Georgia proved larger than expected and Narváez ran out of food, the "Santa Saturnina" being very small. Narváez had to return directly to Port Discovery, and then Eliza was eager to then return to Nootka Sound and send a report about the Strait of Georgia. The Spanish thus missed the opportunity of preempting the British exploration of Puget Sound, which took place a year later under George Vancouver.
