Separately from the Ordinance of Secession, Texas also issued a declaration of causes spelling out the rationale for secession. The document specifies several reasons for secession, including its solidarity with its "sister slave-holding States," the Federal government's inability to prevent Indian attacks, slave-stealing raids, and other border-crossing acts of banditry. It accuses Northern politicians and abolitionists of a variety of outrages upon Texans. The bulk of the document offers a justification of slavery and white supremacy, including this extract:

After attending Hagley RC High School, Bartram's first professional club was Wolverhampton Wanderers who in 1985 signed him from non-league, making his first team debut on 23 August 1986 in a 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge United, that marked the club's first-ever game in the fourth tier. However, this proved his only Wolves league outing until April 1991 as the club brought in Mark Kendall, and later Mike Stowell, who were both virtual ever-presents.

The Long Litanies follows, where all pray for the peace, for the ecclesiastic hierarchy and for the congregation. The Nicean Creed is proclaimed, the priest washes his hands three times and sprinkles water on the congregation reciting the Prayer of Reconciliation which is a prayer of worthiness for all who attend the liturgy. Next is the Kiss of peace during which the faithful sing the "Aspasmos Adam" ("Rejoice O Mary") hymn.

Isabel's first show was a sell-out and by September 1934 she was living in Paris. She worked with André Derain and lived and travelled for a time with Balthus and his wife. She was painted several times by Derain and Pablo Picasso. In 1936 Isabel married her first husband, foreign correspondent for the Daily Express, Sefton Delmer. The travel, parties and luxurious apartment in the Place Vendôme, never replaced her Left Bank life, however; and most days she made the long walk there and back. A lifelong Socialist, Isabel visited Spain while Delmer was reporting the Spanish Civil War.

He was more important as a teacher than a painter. His large-scale plan of "Rákóczi March," never progressed much beyond sketches, as he kept changing his mind. His landscapes painted in Técső include "Landscape in Técső", "Landscape with Stacks" and "Sunset with Stacks," in which he applied elements of "en plein air" and Impressionism. His self-portrait (1916), held by the Hungarian National Gallery, is considered one of his most harrowing pictures.

Meanwhile, Mary, Keisha and Shauna meet up for the city finals, having found an abysmal replacement for Izzy with Shauna's cousin Alberna, who is practically blind. Izzy arrives and apologizes to Mary, who jokes around with him and smiles before handing him a uniform, and all is forgiven. They once again face the Dutch Dragons before the match, Lina and Yolanda snarking at them, confident that they would win. The Hot Chili Steppers ignore them and affirm their solidarity before beginning the competition, Chuck, Earl, Tammy, and even Rodney showing up to watch. With Mary's stellar performance, the Hot Chili Steppers take first place in the compulsory competition, while the Dutch Dragons take second, much to their astonishment. In the speed competition, Yolanda beats Izzy by just six steps, tying them for first place and leaving freestyle to determine the winner. Other teams compete while the Hot Chili Steppers look on, and then the Dutch Dragons take their turn. The Hot Chili Steppers take the stage immediately after them, and while doing so, Izzy sees his father and sister entering the arena, greeting him with a smile. Thus encouraged, the Hot Chili Steppers take the stage, performing a series of freestyle jumprope tricks and then a dance number, for which they earn tumultuous applause. Izzy meets his father afterwards while the judges decide the winners, and he apologizes for pushing boxing so hard, having done it motivated by wanting to connect with Izzy. He accepts that boxing is his dream, not Izzy's, and says how proud he is of what he had done. He then meets his friends, who state that they've been enlightened, and Chuck embraces Tammy while Earl feigns nausea. Finally, seeing Rodney, he confronts him, surprised to find his hostility gone and him admitting that the Double Dutch was cool. They agree on a truce, and Izzy agrees to teach his moves to Rodney later to use in the ring.
