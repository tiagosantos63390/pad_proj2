Christian Lara was deliberately striving to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Oruno Lara (1879-1924), who was Guadeloupe's first historian of African descent, in featuring the history of the Caribbean, as is apparent from Christian Lara's subsequent historical feature films. 
Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, in their book "The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions", have drawn attention to the use of mise en scène early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's "bric-à-brac". This technique draws attention to the painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on "the famous homecoming queen shot" of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the "emotional claustrophobia" felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.
