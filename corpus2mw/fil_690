After the end of British rule in 1947, Cox's Bazar became part of East Pakistan. Captain Advocate Fazlul Karim, the first Chairman (after independence from the British) of Cox's Baazar Municipality, established the Tamarisk Forest along the beach. He wanted to attract tourists as well as to protect the beach from tidal waves (tsunami). He donated much of his father-in-law's and his own lands as sites for constructing a Public Library and a Town Hall. He was inspired to build Cox's Baazar as a tourist spot after seeing beaches of Bombay and Karachi, and was a resort pioneer in developing Cox's Bazar as a destination. He founded a Maternity Hospital, the Stadium and the drainage system by procuring grants from the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation through correspondence. T. H. Matthews, the principal of the Dacca Engineering College (1949~1954), was a friend who had helped him in these fundraising efforts. Engineer Chandi Charan Das was the government civil engineer who had worked on all these projects. In 1959 the municipality was turned into a town committee.

On 21 March 1791 and seven months shy of his 40th birthday, he honorably retired from the army, was given the title of Baron and took a civic oath. A civic oath was sworn by all persons as a pre-condition for citizen status. This was especially important leading up to and during the French revolution, especially among foreigners and nobility, both of which Kilmaine was. For almost an entire year he pursued family life and philanthropic interests. By personal invitation of Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, he rejoined the French army when the war broke out in 1792 between France and monarchic Europe.
Monteverdi, the Swiss brand of luxury cars, used Scout IIs to mass-produce well-equipped luxurious off-road station wagons. Two models were made in the late seventies, the Safari, which had most of the bodywork changed, and the Sahara, which featured more limited changes, i.e. changed grill and a more luxurious interior. Both were available with IH's SV-345 engine or Chrysler's LA 318 (5.7 or 5.2 litres). The Safari was also offered with Chrysler's 7.2 litre "440 RB" engine, while the lesser Sahara could be had with Nissan's SD33 diesel engine.
