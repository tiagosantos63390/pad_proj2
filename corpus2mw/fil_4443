Numbering.
FOQA or Flight Data systems are similar to HUMS as they monitor the vehicle usage. They are useful for IVHM in the same way as they allow the usage of the vehicle to be thoroughly understood which aids in the design of future vehicles. It also allows excessive loads and usage to be identified and corrected. For example if an aircraft was experiencing frequent heavy landings the maintenance schedule for the undercarriage could be changed to ensure that they are not wearing too fast under the increased load. The load carried by the aircraft could be lessened in future or operators could be given additional training to improve the quality of the landings.

Another boxset, "Blur 21 Vinyl Edition", was released at the same time, featuring the band's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl, each of the LPs repackaged as a double album except for "Leisure", a single album. The vinyl edition does not, however, include any previously unreleased material. As above, the "Blur 21" CD/DVD/7" single pack contains many previously unreleased recordings, including the long-awaited releases of previously known about songs like "Pap Pop", "Beached Whale" and "Sir Elton John's Cock". Yet some previously released songs by the band have not been listed as featuring on the box set, such as "Colours", a "Think Tank" outtake released as a fan club single in 2003. Likewise, some unreleased songs are not featured on the box set, like "Death Metal", a jam session from the "13" sessions in 1998, and "For Old Time's Sake", recorded in 1993 for "The Sunday Sunday Popular Community Song CD", but left off the EP, due to it possibly being deleted or lost. Additionally, no material from the band's 1998 live recording and remix album "Bustin' + Dronin'" appears on the box set. "Rarities 2", one of the bonus albums in the box set, features an early mix of "Under the Westway" with some differences between it and the 2012 single version.

On November 29, 2008, The Crown Jewels won via forfeit at "Double Intensity" when Chase Del Monte and Fred Curry, Jr. failed to appear at the referee’s ten count; they subsequently faced Team Nightmare in a match which ended in a double-disqualification. DellaGatta then wrestled Evan Siks in a singles match at NECW's January 10 show "Snowbrawl" to decide the guest referee for their team's grudge match at the next supercard, a match won by "Bad Boy Jason".
