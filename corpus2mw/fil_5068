The cemetery was used as the burial ground for the Jews of nearby Abterode ( until 1660 ), Reichensachsen ( until 1700 ) and Sontra ( until 1710 ), which all later established their own cemeteries, and also for Netra and Eschwege. The oldest of the surviving tombstones dates from 1642 and the last of them marked the grave of Salomon Kugelmann, who died on 11 April 1855 ( 23 Nisan 5615, according to the Jewish calendar ). Two years later, in 1857, the cemetery was closed when the Jews of Eschwege opened their own cemetery but it opened for one more time on 28 April 1861 ( 18 Iyar 5621, according to the Jewish calendar ) for the burial of the last remaining Jew of Jestädt, a penniless old man who had died childless at the age of 73.

History.

Frønningen is an historic manor. It was sold in 1651 to a lecturer from Bergen, the magister Peder Nilssøn Lem, whose mother owned one of the neighboring farms. He then extended his properties in the area. Hans Sørensen Lem was the first of the family who moved here and actually lived on Frønningen, when he moved here about 1740. The estate was owned by the Lem family until 1889, when it was taken over by Bjarnhard Rumohr, who was a relative of the last Lem.
The tower is in perpendicular style, in three exterior visual stages separated by stringing. On different levels it has three interior floors consisting of the vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle floor levels are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal buttresses run up the bottom two stages and half of the top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west door, in a "segmental-pointed" arch with "broad chamfer" is in the lower exterior stage. The three-light window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an embattled parapet. The tower is floodlit at night.

The Balfour Note of 1 August 1922, signed by Britain's acting Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, was sent to Britain's debtors France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Portugal and Greece. Balfour claimed that the British government had reluctantly decided that the loans that those countries had received from HM Treasury should be paid back and that reparations from Germany should be collected due to the need for Britain to pay its creditors, the United States.

In mathematics, a Janet basis is a normal form for systems of linear homogeneous partial differential equations (PDEs) that removes the inherent arbitrariness of any such system. It was introduced in 1920 by Maurice Janet. It was first called the Janet basis by F. Schwarz in 1998.
The Wall Street Crash in the USA and the worldwide Great Depression greatly diminished the market for prints, but many artists continued to design plates, though fewer in number, in smaller editions and at lower prices, as the volumes of "Fine Prints of the Year" between 1930 and 1938 show. For example the artist Edmund Blampied issued 76 etchings between 1920 and 1929, typically in editions of 100 proofs, but in the following decade only published 23 etchings, some in editions of less than 50 proofs.

In 1963, Hasenjaeger built an Universal Turing machine out of old telephone relays. Although Hasenjaeger work on UTM's was largely unknown and he never published any details of the machinery during his lifetime, his family decided to donate the machine to the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn, Germany, after his death."In a academic paper presented at the International Conference of History and Philosophy of Computing" Rainer Glaschick, Turlough Neary, Damien Woods, Niall Murphy had examined Hasenjaeger's UTM machine at the request of Hasenjaeger family and found that the UTM was remarkably small and efficiently universal. Hasenjaeger UTM contained 3-tapes, 4 states, 2 symbols and was an evolution of ideas from Edward F. Moore's first universal machine and Hao Wang's B-machine. Hasenjaeger went on to build a small efficient Wang B-machine simulator. This was again proven by the team assembled by Rainer Glaschick to be efficiently universal.
