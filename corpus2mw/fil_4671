The Tong Wars were fought not only on the streets and alleys of the Chinatown, but also on the rooftops in a deadly guerrilla warfare-like fashion. In a large number of cases, a tong war was started over the issue of a woman, whether it be the failure of one tong to fully pay for a slave-girl of another tong (As in the case of the Bing On tong – Wah Sin San Fan tong War) or just for the sheer fact of the limited amount of Chinese women in the area during the time (Hop Sing tong- Suey Sing tong War). Other tong wars started due to a variety of issues, such as defamation of a rival tong’s “face” to attempting to take another tong's business. The Bing On tong – Wah Sin San Fan tong War was caused when Bing On sold the girl to a Wah Ting member but he did not pay the full amount specified, and the Bing Ons demanded that the bill be paid. The Wah Tings replied that the girl was not even worth $500 and if they wanted to do something about it they were welcome to try at their own risk. The Hop Sing tong- Suey Sing tong War was particularly bloody, and by the time a truce was signed, four Hop sings lay dead with four more wounded compared to the Suey Sings’ two dead, one wounded. This ongoing war was particularly bloody, as even though the truce was signed, they went back to war for a two more times, one time being of a three-month duration in 1900, which produced even deadlier results (seven dead in total, eight wounded and not a single murderer captured by police). The other each killed one member of the other group, and the Hop Sings attempted to dynamite their rivals' headquarters.
Several brain regions including the bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated both in instances of first person painful experience and observed painful experience. The bilateral anterior insula (AI) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are therefore hypothesized to take part in the emotional reaction evoked from witnessing another in pain. The somatosensory region of the brain was not shown by fMRI to be excited during pain observation, rather only when the pain was experienced firsthand.

On 4 May 1919, the WWF were blockading the wharf to prevent the NWWU workers from reaching the "Dimboola". The NWWU workers, however, arrived in boats down the river, accompanied by the Western Australian Premier, Hal Colebatch (who was only Premier for a month). In the fracas, Tom Edwards, a union worker, was attempting to assist the WWF president William Renton when he was struck on the head by a police baton. He died three days later at Fremantle Hospital.

Performance history.
At the end of July, Preserve was sent to compete at Goodwood Racecourse where she was entered in four events. On the opening day she ran in the Drawing Room Stakes in which she was set to concede four pounds to the Riddlesworth Stakes winner Oak-Apple. Ridden again by Flatman, she won by two lengths from the colt Outcast with Oak-Apple, who was favoured in the betting, finishing third. On the following day Preserve had two engagements, beginning with the Verulam Stakes in which she was allowed to walk over the one mile course for a £100 prize after her opponents were withdrawn by their owners. Later the same day, Preserve started 9/2 second favourite for the Goodwood Stakes, an all-aged handicap run over a distance of three miles. Carrying a weight of 108 pounds, she finished second of the fourteen runners, beaten a length the Ascot Gold Cup winner Glaucus. She appeared to be a very unlucky loser, having been badly hampered when making her challenge inside the final furlong. Two days later Preserve reappeared in the one mile Racing Sweepstakes and won by ten lengths from her only opponent, a colt named Gladiator.
