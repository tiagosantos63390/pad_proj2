Adult "Campsicnemus popeye" has a body length between 3 to 3.2 mm, and wing length of 3.1 to 3.6 mm. Its head is black in colour with dark-brown toward the front face. It has a pair of antennae and a pair of compound eyes, which are distinctively red. The antennal segments are a mixture of black and yellow patterns. The main body (thorax) is yellow, while its setae are black. The mid-tibia is particularly enlarged towards the apical region, somewhat like the swollen forearms of Popeye. The wing membrane is uniformly pale-smoky coloured. The abdominal segments (tergites) are largely brown, with yellow stripes on the sites of tergites II and IV. Each tergite has numerous short black hairs on the dorsal side, and few long hairs on the side. The main difference of a female from a male is absence of large spiny setae on the legs, and the swollen legs.

Znamierovsky was born in Zatišje, Ludza, in eastern Latvia, to a father who worked as a land-surveyor and a mother who was a music teacher. He attended the St. Petersburg Academy of Art twice between 1912 and 1917, and then attended Vilnius University from 1926 to 1929. He studied under Ferdynand Ruszczyc, Arkady Rylov, and Nicholas Roerich. Znamierovsky lived in Vilnius the remainder of his life, and often painted images of the cities landscapes. By 1965, he painted around 1400 landscapes and made 800 sketches and over 3000 artworks in his entire 50 year career as an artist.
