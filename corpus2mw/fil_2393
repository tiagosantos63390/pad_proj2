History.
In an Okanagan story Coyote tries to catch some swans, but they fool him by playing dead. Not realizing that the swans are just faking, Coyote unwittingly ties them to his son and crawls up a pine tree to get a pitch top for kindling. The swans then flew away with his son, and in Coyote’s haste to get down to save him his long hair got caught in the tree. The swans drop Coyote’s son to his death, and Coyote has to cut off his hair to get free. Coyote then transformed his hair into wila, and pronounces that his valuable hair should not be wasted, rather it should be gathered by the people, and the old women should make it into food.
