They tell the story of Inspector Singh, a fat Sikh, Singaporean murder investigator, with a track record in catching killers. He does not fit into the Singapore police force culture, so he gets sent by his superiors on investigations anywhere but Singapore. The aim is to keep him as far from Singapore as possible and hopefully to keep him away from trouble, which is always near by when Inspector Singh is involved.

The school itself welcomes students from any background who are interested in studying the classic texts of Rabbinic Judaism and living an authentic halachic Torah-observant lifestyle.
This is a particularly important criterion for assessing whether an animal has the capacity to experience pain rather than only nociception. Nociceptive responses do not require consciousness or higher neural processing; this results in relatively fixed, reflexive actions. However, the experience of pain does involve higher neural centres which also take into account other factors of relevance to the animal, i.e. competing motivations. This means that a response to the experience of pain is likely to be more plastic than a nociceptive response when there are competing factors for the animal to consider.
During the last years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí participated only in minor projects which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Família. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaudí. It was put in the Sagrada Família, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936. Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellterçol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Lluís Bonet i Garí, Gaudí's assistant.

Slouch socks seem to be gaining in popularity again, partly as a result of the popularity of Manga and Cosplay culture. Japanese style "loose socks", an exaggerated form of slouch sock with heavily ribbed uppers ranging from 24" to 48" in length, and "super loose socks" with uppers that can range from 48" to 72" in length are available from various web retailers. One look that's growing in popularity is to wear a pair of loose socks with leggings and a pair of calf length boots, with the socks slouched down over the top of the boots. The winter sock selections in 2012 show a distinct trend towards longer, thicker and slouchier socks, with both men's and women's styles featuring loose-fitting knit fabrics and heavily ribbed uppers.

The school is named in a charter of count William III of Holland in 1323 under the name "schole" or "scoele", and is probably founded in the second half of the 13th century. After the Siege of Leiden (1573-1574) Nicholaus Stochius was named rector. Around 1700 the school was named gymnasium in official Latin documents (in Dutch: Latijnse school). The name Stedelijk ('municipal') Gymnasium was introduced in 1838, together with a new educational approach.

"The Comic Strip" album achieved some attention owing to the strong language used by the performers, which prompted the label to place a parental advisory sticker on the front cover. It also attracted attention because of its long duration – with a total running time of over 69 minutes on a single 12" disc – considerably longer than the customary 40 minutes per album.
