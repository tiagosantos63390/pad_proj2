Moreira was born in Matola just outside Maputo, the capital of Mozambique on 13 February 1977.
Out of politics, in 1990 the Government of Canada appointed him to diplomatic missions abroad which organized and supervised democratic elections in 10 African countries, in 2 countries from the former Soviet Union, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He finished twelfth at the 2006 European Championships. He also competed at the 2009 European Indoor Championships, but without reaching the final.


His descendants lived in the house for almost a century, until 1943. There have been very few alterations to the interior. It is one of the few surviving octagon houses built as Fowler had originally intended.
He was featured on the Versus television series TapouT, where he was sponsored before his fight with Anthony Njokuani. Cerrone won the fight in the first round with a triangle choke.
Alcaeus of Messene (; Greek: ) was an ancient Greek poet, who flourished between 219 and 196 BC. Twenty-two of his short poems or epigrams survive in the Greek Anthology, from some of which his date may be fixed at around the late 3rd/early 2nd century BC. Some of his poems are on literary themes, but most are political.
