The island is uninhabited and tree covered but sits opposite houses with extensive river frontages. The island shows the effect of soil movement, with the upstream end almost joined to the bank, and the downstream end broken into smaller islets.
In the Epic of Baal, Shapash plays an important part in the plot, as she interacts with all of the main characters, and in the end she is favourable to Baal's position as king. She announces that El supports Yam. By delivering her verdict in the final struggle of Baal with Mot, she reveals her role as judge among the gods, and by her judgement against Mot, as saviour of humankind, two aspects, Brian B. Schmidt observes, that conform with what is known of Shamash's function in Mesopotamia. After Baal is killed, she helps Anat bury and mourn him, and then stops shining. Following El's dream about the resurrection of Baal, El asks Anat to persuade Shapash to shine again, which she agrees to, but declares that she will continue to search for him. In the battle between Baal and Mot, she threatens Mot that El will intervene in Baal's favour, a threat which ends the battle.
Throughout the 1950s, however state voters regularly rejected constitutional amendments which provided for public consumption. Votes were generally along regional lines, with northern areas and larger cities supporting repeal, and southern and rural areas supporting the continued ban. In 1961, the state legislature found a "work-around" that short-circuited another vote. The new law provided for a new type of "private club". In actual practice, these "private clubs" are simply public places. Patrons become "members" for one dollar with the purchase of their first drink, which comes with a one dollar "discount", with the law requiring that the club may not refuse "membership" to any person over age 21. In previous years, patrons were actually issued membership cards, but this practice has fallen into disuse and 99% of patrons are unaware that they are members of any such "club". Technically, public bars and saloons remain illegal in the state to this day. The 1961 law was a part of a political deal whereby southern legislators agreed to these changes, and northern legislators withdrew their blocking of the renaming of Marshall College, which had been accredited as a "university" since 1937 and which is located in southern West Virginia, to Marshall University. This system remains in effect to this day. Such "clubs" are required to post a registry number which begins with the letter "ABCC" followed by a serial number, over their doors.

"Metrioxena" apparently feed only on "Arenga" sugar palms (Arecaceae). Larvae, though little is known about them, are probably eating the wood of dead or dying trees, while the adults eat pollen. The Paleogene fossil "Metrioxena electrica" was found in conifer amber from the Baltic region, where palms are known to have grown some 50 million years ago.
