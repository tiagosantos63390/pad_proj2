Due to the successful development of their previous 26 and 27 knot torpedo boat destroyers, John I Thornycroft & Company developed their two funnel design for the 1894/95 – 1897/98 building programs. The ships were considered an incremental improvement to the previous 27-knot design of the 1893/94 program.
