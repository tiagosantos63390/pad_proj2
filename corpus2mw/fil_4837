The machines were first placed just before the Black Friday shopping holiday in 2012. In 2013, the machines began operating in three locations: Westfield Century City, Westfield Topanga and Hollywood and Hyland. The owners credit their daughter for coming up with the idea when they were purchasing a cupcake from a vending machine. The coverage of the placement of the machines included the comments "I feel sure that, very soon, you will be able to buy engagement rings, tiaras, mink coats and leather bodices amid all the excitement of the mall -- but without the interruption of some obsequious store assistant," from CNet, and a marketing analyst stating that the idea was merely to generate buzz.

Janet Taylor Spence and Kenneth Spence were married on December 27, 1959 and moved to Iowa shortly after. As she was female and unable to get a job at the Department of Psychology of the University of Iowa, she was hired by the Veterans Hospital in Iowa City as a research psychologist. While working at the VA Hospital, she was able to expand her interests to the study of schizophrenia. In 1964, she and her husband moved to Austin, Texas for his job at the University of Texas. Just like in Iowa, because she was female, she was unable to get a job at the university. She accepted a job at an institution for the mentally handicapped called the Austin State School. While there, she began a number of studies with normal and mentally handicapped children. She was later offered a position at the University of Texas by the Department of Educational Psychology. She went on to replace the chair of the Department of Psychology.

On May 9, 1988 a pond located at a nearby residence near the site suffered a fish and bird kill. Numerous dead fish (shad and catfish) and ten dead birds (Snowy Egrets) were found around the perimeter of the pond. Upon necropsy, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) determined the fish tissue was contaminated by high levels of several different pesticides. The CDFG analyzed the pond and concluded that high winds blew pesticides from the Stoker airplane cleaning activities into the pond. After the discovery of dead birds and fish, the pond was closed to public activities due to the belief of contamination. Later in 1988, an on-site warehouse that contained pesticide supplies caught fire and burned to the ground. The fire started in the east end of the warehouse where sulfur and diatomaceous clays were stored. To avoid health risks, businesses and residences within a 2-mile radius were evacuated. During the fire, approximately 300 tons of soil were contaminated and later disposed of in a landfill regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
