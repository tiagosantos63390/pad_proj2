Medwin had also embarked on what may be regarded as his finest achievements, the translations of Aeschylus's plays into English. It was a prodigious piece of work with "Prometheus Unbound" and "Agamemon" appearing in companion volumes in May 1833, followed by "The Seven Tribes Against Thebes, The Persians, The Eumenides" and "The Choephori". He did not translate "The Suppliants", apparently because he disapproved of "its corruptions". The translations were enthusiastically reviewed by important literary magazines, including The Gentleman's Magazine, and published in Fraser's Magazine but there was some criticism that he had strayed from the original meaning, which Medwin had intentionally done when he felt the occasion demanded. Medwin's skill lay in bringing alive Aeschylus's characters through believable dialogue that uses traditional metres and measure.

The puppets or marionettes are made of wood, silk and brocade or embroidered cloth. They are operated by strings and push rods from within the yatai. “Karakuri (mechanical) puppet plays performed on a stage are superb”. The puppets like the Yatai represent the skilled craftsmen of the area. The puppets or The three marionettes “on Hotei Tai (the god of fortune)” require 9 puppet masters to manipulate the 36 strings which make the marionettes move in a lifelike manner, with gestures, turns and other movements. A problem with the puppets are parts needed to repair the puppets. The springs in the puppets are made of Right whale baleen and cannot be replaced with steel springs or the baleen of other whales. Other materials used to make the springs cannot duplicate the movements of the springs made with Right whale baleen.
The Catholic Church's response to the scandal can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at all three levels in parallel with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. The United States' National Conference of Bishops passed a "zero tolerance" policy in June 2002.

In Cantonese, Aberdeen is known indigenously as Hong Kong Tsai (香港仔), which means Hong Kong Minor, Son of Hong Kong or Little Hong Kong. It is believed that Aberdeen is where the name of Hong Kong (more accurate transcription, Heung Kong) originates. Heung Kong Tsuen (香港村, Hong Kong village) on Ap Lei Chau was mentioned in Ming maps. Another walled-village Heung Kong Wai in Wong Chuk Hang was also founded during Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. Hong Kong means 'fragrant harbour' and it was Aberdeen where incense trees (aquilaria sinensis) from the New Territories used to be transferred for export to other cities in China. One alternative Chinese name was 'Shek Pai Wan' (石排灣).

The young Ismail began playing football using tennis balls which he got from a neighbour in Al-Karkh who was working with the British before he started school. It was at Dar Al-Mualamin Primary in Al-Karkh where he was taught by Egyptian PE teacher Safwat Al-Ameiri. One of his fellow students was Abdul-Ghani Askar, who Ismail still says possesses the strongest shot that he has seen to this day. Ismail played in several school tournaments involving other schools from Baghdad; one game was against the Al-Tahera Primary, where one of Baghdad’s best players Nassir “Chico” Yousef was studying.

This detection technique is also being used by the Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna (ANITA) and the Radio Ice Cerenkov Experiment (RICE) detectors. The ARA experiment will be built around the IceCube experiment, and will cover an area of approximately 100 square kilometers.
Also, if formula_5 is an order isomorphism from formula_1 to formula_2 and formula_31 is an order isomorphism from formula_2 to formula_33, then the function composition of formula_5 and formula_31 is itself an order isomorphism, from formula_1 to formula_33.
