John Thomas Quekett (1815 - 1861) was a pioneering histologist. His brother Edwin lived at 50 Wellclose Square. John moved in with his brother. In 1839 John founded the "Royal Microscopical Society". He was conservator of the Hunterian Museum until his death. Dr Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward (1791 - 1868) invented the terrarium (a dry version of an aquarium). He invented it about 1829, because his ferns were being poisoned by the London air. 
A census, which was necessary for the election to be held, was initially planned to be held in July 2007, then from 15 November 2007 onwards, then delayed to be held from 2 February 2008 onwards due to funding issues. It was again postponed to 15â€“30 April 2008. On 12 April 2008, a few days before the census was slated to start, the SPLM withdrew from the census, stating that they wanted IDPs to return to their homes before the census would take place. However, it was agreed on 14 April 2008 to start the census on 22 April 2008 instead. It was finished by 6 May 2008 (with about 90% of the country covered by then; many people claimed, however, not to have been counted, but officials stated that in no state was the covering rate below 80%.) Preliminary results that hit the press in early July claimed a population of about , with in Southern Sudan. This strongly contradicted former estimates of at least residents in the south. However, the Central Bureau of Statistics quickly denied these figures, saying no numbers had yet been released. The full results of the census were announced on a press conference by Central Bureau of Statistics on 12 May 2009. The total of Sudan's population were reported as 39,154,490, with 8,260,490 in the south.
The loch was once the property of the monks of Kilwinning Abbey and it is recorded that in 1482 the monks took legal action against the Montgomeries of Giffin Castle and James Ker who were accused of "dangerous destruction and down-casting of the fosses and dikes of the loch called Loch Brand." It is not recorded what effect these actions had upon the size and depth of the loch.
On 17 January 2012, Ripper announced his resignation as state Labor leader. At a caucus meeting on 23 January, McGowan was elected unopposed as Ripper's successor.
Theory.
Plot.
Beginning with personal contacts early in his career, Matthews was instrumental in conciliating relations between religious scholars affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ, which had separated in a schism in the 1840s. The two religious communities, and their scholars, had long been at odds over access to and interpretation of important early texts of the Latter Day Saint movement. Matthews was particularly influential when, in 1969 and 1970, scholars affiliated with the Community of Christ were invited to meetings of the Mormon History Association. The new scholars were welcomed and some were chosen as officers in the organization in later years. Matthews is also noted for his promotion of the concept that the currently available text of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible is reliable and authentic.
