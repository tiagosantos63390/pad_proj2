Both sides now began to gradually feed in reinforcements. One year later, in August 1967, the Vietnamese communists besieged the Royalist stronghold. Both sides now expedited reinforcements into the battle. The battle-hardened 316th Division, plus an independent regiment, moved in from North Vietnam to join the attack; they brought the North Vietnamese strength to about 4,100 soldiers. Opposing them by now were some 7,500 Royalist troops, including 3,000 irregulars. However, Royalist battle performance was poor. Coordination of close air support ranged from poor to disastrous. Air assets were in short supply as it was, but the Royalists refused to utilize all available air power after a friendly fire incident. Command and control communications within the defense were iffy. The resupply system broke down, leaving some units under-equipped. Artillery support for the infantry was nonexistent or inadequate.
