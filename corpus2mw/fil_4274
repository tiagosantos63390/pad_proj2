The Mughal empire had been weakened by ruinous wars of succession in the three decades following the death of Aurangzeb. The Muslim nobles had asserted their independence whilst the Hindu Marathas had captured vast swathes of territory in Central and Northern India. Its ruler, Muhammad Shah, proved unable to stop the disintegration of the empire. The imperial court administration was corrupt and weak whereas the country was extremely rich whilst Delhi’s prosperity and prestige was still at a high. Nadir Shah, attracted by the country's wealth, sought plunder like so many other foreign invaders before him.

Most round pens are located outdoors, but due to their relatively small size can easily be enclosed by a roof or a tension fabric building. Round pens made of portable panels are sometimes set up within a larger riding arena allowing one horse to be worked in the round pen while others may still ride along the rail of the larger area.
