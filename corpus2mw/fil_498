Intensive-care nurses endure intensive didactic and clinical orientation, in addition to their general nursing knowledge, to provide highly specialized care for critical patients. Their competencies include the administration of high-risk medications, management of high-acuity patients requiring ventilator support, surgical care, resuscitation, advanced interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy procedures, as well as chronic-care management or lower acuity cares associated with premature infants such as feeding intolerance, phototherapy, or administering antibiotics. NICU RNs undergo annual skills tests and are subject to additional training to maintain contemporary practice.

Irish (specifically the Connacht dialect) is the main spoken language of Carraroe, the settlement being the most populous Irish speaking village in the Connemara Gaeltacht. It is one of the strongest Irish speaking areas in Ireland. There are two summer schools which teach Irish to English-speaking secondary-school students from all over Ireland. Students usually stay for three weeks with local families. Carraroe is also a centre for the Irish-language media. The main national Irish-language newspaper "Foinse" had its head office in the village; the Irish-language radio station, RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, is in nearby Costelloe, and the Irish-language TV station, TG4, is based at Baile na hAbhann, a few kilometres east. Catholic church services are in Irish only. All school lessons are conducted in Irish.
The station's digital channel is multiplexed:

In addition, new employees may be added to an existing unit without the need for either an election or proof of majority support if they share such an overwhelming community of interest with the employees in the existing unit that they could not be represented separately. As an example, a new department in a factory in which a union represents all of the production and maintenance employees in a “wall to wall” unit is likely to be accreted to that unit. The NLRB will not accrete employees to an existing unit, however, if they have been historically excluded from the unit, no matter how strong the community of interest might be; in that case the union must obtain proof of majority support to add them to the unit.

The successful series of exhibitions in private galleries begun in 1968 continued (Frankfurt, Geneva, Paris, New York, Milan and Hanover, among others). This year he finally produced "Romeo e Giulietta", using the technique of injection casting, which for the first time enabled him to make 2000 copies of a sculpture. He used similar techniques to make "Goliath" (consisting of 80 pieces) and "Richelieu" (61 pieces). He worked on the book/object "Petite Rapsodie de la main", with text by Loys Masson. Important works produced during this period are "Sainte Agathe II", "Cleopatra" and "Alfa e Romeo", a work specifically studied as an illustration for "Petite Rapsodie de la main". "Mini David" began the series of five mini-sculptures produced in quantities of 10,000 copies, using the automatic injection technique, a subtle procedure hitherto used exclusively in industrial manufacture. The Galería Iolas-Velasco in Madrid presented his sculptures in Spain for the first time. Various well-known dealers created Multicetera, a company for the distribution of his mini-sculptures. He received the Gold Medal from the Presidency of the Italian Republic for “Metal as a pure expression of art” at the V Biennale del Metallo in Gubbio.

Gamesa and Iberdrola are currently making important investments in Juchitán, to create a big wind power eolic park -called Proyecto La Venta II- able to produce at least 88 megawatts of energy. The project will make Juchitán the center of the alternative energies in Mexico becoming an example to the rest of Latin America as the eolic park would be the largest in all the region. This project has been criticized because of the lack of information given by Gamesa, Iberdrola and the Mexican Government about its possible ecological, political and cultural consequences on a region where its culture is based on the property of the land used by the Proyecto La Venta II.
