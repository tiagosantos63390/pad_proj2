The Australian national team is one of the most successful in world tennis. They are seven-time world champions and have reached a total of seventeen finals, both second highest all-time behind United States. Between 1963 and 1980, the Australian team played in every single final except for three. However, in recent times the Australian team has had a comparative lack of success, only appearing in the World Group five times between 1995 and 2010, and never going beyond the first round. However, the team has experienced a resurgence in recent times, accumulating a 15–6 win–loss record since 2005 and returning to the World Group in 2011 and 2013. Samantha Stosur holds the record for most singles wins by an Australian in Fed Cup, while Wendy Turnbull holds the record for most doubles wins, most overall tie wins, and most ties participated in.

"My Happiness" is a song by Australian rock band Powderfinger. It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band's fourth album, "Odyssey Number Five". The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart—the first Powderfinger song to do so.
