Reviews of the programme were generally unfavourable with critics citing its lack of credibility. John Crace of "The Guardian" wrote: "Government cuts as entertainment is both morally and factually iffy...In the end we didn't actually learn that much about what councils can and cannot afford or whether they offer good value for money; only that they manage it better than a bunch of 50 amateurs trying to do it on their own. But we did learn why the big society is probably a doomed project." Writing on their website, Chris Daniel, of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: "Whilst the theatrical show made for sensationalist television the concept was completely flawed. It bore little relation to the actual challenge people would face."
Since 1648, the political situation in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth underwent years of crisis. The Khmelnytsky Uprising was a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine which posed a threat to the existence of the Commonwealth. One of the targets of the Cossacks was the liquidation of the Greek-Catholic Church, and this request was considered acceptable by the Latin Catholic Poles who, after being defeated by the Cossacks, signed the Treaty of Zboriv in 1649, only the Papal nuncio and Greek-Catholic bishops opposed. The Cossacks army arrived to forcedly abolish the Greek-Catholic eparchy of Chełm, one of the stronghold of the Greek-Catholic Church. In September 1651, due to a temporary defeat of the Cossacks, the new Treaty of Bila Tserkva was signed and it contained no more statements about the liquidation of the Greek-Catholic Church which was allowed to re-enter in Chełm and Przemyśl.
