Prevention Point Philadelphia was founded in 1991 by a group of UP Philadelphia activists in response to the HIV & AIDS epidemic. That year, injected drug use was the most common risk category for people being diagnosed with HIV infection. At the time, it was illegal to distribute syringes/needles in Pennsylvania, and the activists risked jail time for their work.
