This is a list of rulers of Saba and Himyar. It is based on the unabridged book of Dr. Javad Ali "The history of Arab nations before Islam" which derives and reconstructs the lineage of the kings of Saba and Himyar based on inscriptions and other historiographical evidence. This book is in Arabic and has been translated to Persian. In the Qur'an, the title "Tubba" is used to refer to these rulers.

After the inspiring Green Bay win, Chicago lost a close game at Mile High Stadium to the Denver Broncos 31–29 on Monday Night Football, then beat Green Bay at home and Minnesota on the road, in the infamous "Rollerdome" game (Mike Ditka referred to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome by this name, prompting the Vikings' cheerleaders to parade around on skates throughout the contest.) The Bears were 10–2 with three games left, but dropped 2 of them, and struggled into the playoffs. One of those losses was a 41–0 disaster at San Francisco at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers, and Mike Ditka threw his gum at a heckling fan, prompting assault charges to be filed against him. This was certainly not a good way to enter the playoffs.

Like many computer publications of the time, "SoftSide" fell on hard times because of financial pressures and competition. This came during their attempt in 1983 to increase their distribution and reach a larger audience of readers. As a result, Robitaille made some efforts to reorganize the publication into a new magazine called "SoftSide 2.0" (directed towards the computer user), and "Code" (for the programmer), with disk versions of both to be made available. He was never able to get either concept fully established, and "SoftSide" ended with its August 1984 issue.4
