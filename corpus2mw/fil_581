The electoral district was abolished in 1924 when it was merged into Muskoka—Ontario riding.
but in the 20th century, as its popularity began to spread (aided by the ability to record performances), it became a national phenomenon. Today, "dikir barat" competitions have become wildly popular across Malaysia, and each year there are national champions crowned, not only for the "dikir barat" groups as a whole, but there also are national champion in the categories of "tukang karuts" and "tok juara". Top "tukang karuts" are famous and popular, much like rock stars in the West.

The markets are located on a 33-hectare site in Footscray Road, West Melbourne. They are adjacent to the Melbourne Fish Markets, the Port of Melbourne and the South Dynon railway yards and are to be moved to Epping by 2012 in order to facilitate access to the railway yards from the port.
In the second quarter, Toronto's Mike Vanderjagt kicked a field goal and Jimmy Cunningham returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown. Another Vanderjagt field goal put Toronto up 13-9. Edmonton regained the lead with a 75-yard pass and run from McManus to Jim Sandusky but lost it again when Robert Drummond scored for Toronto from the one. Edmonton's Henry "Gizmo" Williams reversed that in one play as he returned the kickoff 91 yards for the touchdown, a Grey Cup record that stood until the Eskimos' Tony Tompkins topped it with a 95-yard kickoff return in the 93rd Grey Cup. Flutie marched the Argos to the Edmonton 10 then ran in himself for the touchdown with 20 seconds left in the half to give Toronto the lead 27-23 at halftime, closing a quarter that saw the teams combine for 41 points.

The station has three passenger platforms and a parcels bay (which is now out of use). Platforms 1 and 2 are an island on the northbound (Up) side and Platform 3 and the old parcels dock are on the southbound (Down) side. There are two through lines between platforms 2 and 3. All passenger platforms are subdivided into 'a' (north end) and 'b' (south end), and all are of 12 car length. All platforms have access to all routes, although there is no access from either through line to or from the North Downs Line - all traffic from this direction must pass through a platform.

Controversies surrounding the AMA education system.


In 1962 J. G. Fox pointed out that all previous experimental tests of the constancy of the speed of light were conducted using light which had passed through stationary material: glass, air, or the incomplete vacuum of deep space. As a result, all were thus subject to the effects of the extinction theorem. This implied that the light being measured would have had a velocity different than that of the original source. He concluded that there was likely as yet no acceptable proof of the second postulate of special relativity. This surprising gap in the experimental record was quickly closed in the ensuing years, by experiments by Fox, and by Alvager et al., which used gamma rays sourced from high energy mesons. The high energy levels of the measured photons, along with very careful accounting for extinction effects, eliminated any significant doubt from their results.

The Irreconcilables were bitter opponents of the Treaty of Versailles in the United States in 1919. Specifically, the term refers to about 12 to 18 United States Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who fought intensely to defeat the ratification of the treaty by the Senate in 1919. They succeeded, and the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles and never joined the League of Nations.
