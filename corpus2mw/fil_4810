Before there were reforms in rape laws and special units to prosecute rape crimes, rape was a difficult case to prosecute as a crime; this is due to issue of consent, the need to provide sufficient evidence to charge the accused, and sometime biased cultural depictions of sexuality and gender. The prosecution largely relies on organizations, advocacy groups, or social movements such as the Anti-rape movement in order to be effective. The difficulties can also bring negative consequences upon the victims. For example in the United States, a study in the 1980s found that the rape victims who went through the prosecution system had a slower recovery process than those who were not prosecuted.
The last "Königsberger Paukenhund" was killed in April 1945 by his caretaker as the Red Army encircled Königsberg. The caretaker also shot his wife and their kids and then turned the gun upon himself.
