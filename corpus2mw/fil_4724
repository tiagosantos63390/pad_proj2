Jacob had scarcely left the room when Esau returned from the hunt to receive the blessing. The realization that he has been deceived shocks Isaac, yet he acknowledged that Jacob received the blessings as sworn, by adding, "Indeed, he will be remain blessed!" (52:8). Rashi explains that Isaac smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau's show of piety.
In 2008, Rajesh showcased spring summer 2009 collection at Paris Fashion Week which was positively received. The focus of the collection was the play of fabrics such as cotton and organza. The designer also experimented with the colour palette by using bright hues such as fuchsias and corals. With wearable, clean and structured cuts, the products were well appreciated.
