During World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (ex. depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact.

His game did not remain unnoticed and as a consequence he agreed to play for Italian powerhouse Virtus Roma in March 2005. Roma's management probably never regretted their choice, as Hawkins finished the season with an average of 17.1 points per game. During the next season in the Italian capital he shined in ULEB's Eurocup, not only averaging 18.5 points per game, but also showing great versatility and leading the competition in steals with 2.9 per game. Roma reached the quarter final and Hawkins showed he was ready for Europe's highest stage, the Euroleague.

Peach bowl officials pronounced themselves pleased with both the turnout for the game and the action on the field. Though traffic jams snarled attendees' arrival to the stadium, there were only 5,366 no-shows out of 58,212 tickets sold. Following the game, Peach Bowl chairman Ira Hefter announced that the bowl would seek corporate sponsorship and a potential television broadcast deal with a major American television network. The takeover by the chamber of commerce also proved to be successful, as the 1986 game made a small profit. This was an improvement over the three previous Peach Bowls, which lost more than $170,000. The sellout also confirmed that the game would continue to be held annually instead of being abandoned, as sportswriters had speculated prior to the 1986 game.
