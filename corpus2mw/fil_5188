In his interview with Susan Galbraith, tenor Michael Fabiano, who appeared in the March 2014 presentation of Verdi's early "Il corsaro" ("The Corsair"), expands upon the appeal of concert opera and defines what, for him as a performer, are some of the distinctive elements of concert opera production which distinguish it from fully staged and costumed productions:

In 1969, Dilley performed as a member of the “Rainer Dance Group” in Yvonne Rainer’s groundbreaking, improvisational "Continuous Project - Altered Daily" alongside Rainer, Paxton, Becky Arnold, Douglas Dunn and David Gordon.
