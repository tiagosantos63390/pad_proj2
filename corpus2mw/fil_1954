The task of taking Villa Rogatti, the westernmost crossing point, was given to Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). Having conducted reconnaissance on their objective during the night of 5 December 1943, an attack plan was devised by the battalion's commander—Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Bethel Ware—detailing the objectives of all four rifle companies. Once the objectives had been secured by the early morning of 6 December, Anglo-Canadian reinforcements were to be moved into Villa Rogatti, with the intention of repulsing the expected potentially strong German counterattacks. Elements of three German regiments—the 200th and 361st Panzergrenadier, and 26th Panzer—maintained strong defences within the town.

4th Quarter:
Project Soul (the development team of the "Soul" series) had always given the impression that "Soulcalibur IV" would be their last installment as the team was rumored to be disbanded; however, Katsuhiro Harada (producer of the "Tekken" series) said he would seriously consider a sequel if there was sufficient interest and informed fans that he is willing to accept opinions and requests on his Twitter; however, he asked the messages to be short and simple due to his poor English skills. While the possibility of a sequel was stronger than ever, Namco had not made a statement(s) to solidify their commitment for the game. Fans were encouraged to maintain support and show interest to secure development of "Soulcalibur V". On May 11, 2011, Namco Bandai officially announced the new game, which was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on January 31, 2012.
Scoring Summary:
The local sport club, "TV Lonsheim e.V.", founded in 1888, began a history of successes in the 1990s. The club’s greatest success was rising to the Verbandsliga, where opponents such as Waldalgesheim and Ingelheim await. Yet the true “climbers” are keeping themselves in the background and enjoying steadily growing success.

The roadway that carries SR 723 was constructed by 1961. For the first few years of its existence, SR 723 served as the western end of a section of I-70 that was complete. By 1967, I-70 was navigable in both directions from SR 723. Since then, no major changes have occurred to the route.
