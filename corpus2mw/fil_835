His form for Tasmania in the late 1990s soon drew the attention of English county sides, and he signed for Sussex County Cricket Club for the 1999 season. He scored 1,133 runs for Derbyshire in 2005 but it was not enough to prevent relegation. Di Venuto has made the switch to Durham in readiness for the 2007 season, having served Derbyshire for eight years. Upon his first County Championship appearance for Durham in April 2007, Di Venuto carried his bat as the number one batsman throughout Durham's first innings. Di Venuto repeated this feat just three weeks later, scoring a double-century against Kent. In August 2009 Di Venuto hit his highest score of 254 not out against former side Sussex at Chester-le-Street.

The Britai fleet was pursuing surviving Supervision Army ships when they stumbled on Earth and the rebuilt Macross. When the booby trap system in the Macross fired on Britai's recon team it started Space War I. The fact that the humans possessed reaction weaponry (nuclear devices) — a technology the Zentradi have lost — and that the humans were "miclone" roused Britai's curiosity and made him pursue the Macross personally and relentlessly, even as his orders changed with every new revelation concerning the Humans. Because of his long exposure to human culture, he was one of the early defectors to the human side, helping in ending the war in the battle of February 11, 2010. In the aftermath of Space War I, he also helped capture a Zentradi factory satellite for the new United Nations in October 2011.
The film received extremely negative reviews by critics and is considered one of the worst sequels in cinema history. Critics and viewers have criticized the poorly-written story, the absence of Atreyu, the dumbing-down of beloved characters Falkor and the Rock Biter, and the large number of continuity errors. "Variety" stated: "The NeverEnding Story lives up to its title in the worst way possible with this third outing, a charmless, desperate reworking of the franchise that might just as well be subtitled Bastian Goes to High School."
The first royal residence on the Castle Hill was built by King Béla IV of Hungary between 1247 and 1265. It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof.
