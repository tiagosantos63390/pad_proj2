Based on the life of Park Tae-joon, founder and honorary chairman of multinational steel-making company POSCO, this is the story of the people who battled poverty and despair after the colonial era and the Korean War with a relentless pursuit of economic innovation, and the choices they made in the name of love, loyalty and sacrifice. Park worked tirelessly to build a mill that produced steel, which became pivotal to Korea's modernization.

Fruit and berries such as blueberries ("jija"), salmonberries ("tujija' "), lowbush cranberries ("netl' "), highbush cranberries ("tsaltsa, tsoltso"), raspberries ("dwhnikotl' "), crowberries ("dziłnołt'asr"), kinnikinnick berries ("dinish"), timberberries, and wild rose hips ("nichush, nitsush")., edible roots such as "Hedysarum alpinum" (Indian potato, Alaska carrot or wild carrot, "tsosr"), and assorted plants were eaten fresh, preserved for later consumption, or used for medicinal purposes.
