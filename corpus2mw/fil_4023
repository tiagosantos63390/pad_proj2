"The Last Sam Weiss" received generally positive reviews from television critics. Ken Tucker from "Entertainment Weekly" called the episode "equally surprising in its plotting and pacing", praised Sam and Olivia's scenes together, and believed the ending to be "mind-blowing" and "both startling and thrilling". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing the first half "wasn't quite as rollicking as , because there was a lot more set-up and explanation required to keep the story moving" but "then the second half brought in all the emotion and tension, topped off by an unexpected gut-punch of an ending." Murray admitted his "eyes glazed over a bit" during the search for the "crowbar", believing it to be "little too "Lost"-y", but "the quirky Corrigan as Weiss helped put all the mumbo-jumbo over".

Shri Ram is sitting in Padmasan (Lotus position), with only left leg crossed on to the right thigh though (both legs are not crossed unlike in the usual Padmasan). Every day after worship sandalwood’s teeka is applied on Lord Ram’s left’s thumb. It is believed when visiting the Raja Ram Darbaar if worshippers look at the left foots thumb then their wish gets fulfilled. Spotting the left foots thumb on Lord Ram’s idol is not easy, one should not look down since the left leg is folded, instead one should look close to Lord Ram’s right hand. The temple priest can also help in spotting the thumb.
