Biography.
The Marabou is a mid-wing, pod-and-boom style, tandem two seat aircraft with a pusher configuration single engine and a T-tail. The wings are trapezoidal and with 6Â° of dihedral outboard of a brief, constant chord centre section, terminating in winglets. They carry rod actuated ailerons and electrically powered Fowler flaps. The fin and unbalanced, tab assisted rudder are swept and the tapered tailplane carries a single piece tapered elevator. All manual controls are integrated in the UAV's own control drives. The outer wing panels and horizontal tail are metal structures; the wing centre section and the vertical tail are composite.
