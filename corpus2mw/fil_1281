Kingslee James Daley was born the son of a Jamaican father and Scottish mother and grew up in the Camden area of London, without the presence of his father. He was talented in numerous ways at a young age, including football where he was in both the West Ham United and Wimbledon youth teams, only to have his chances of playing professionally ended by injury. He was seen in the Sky Sports advertisement for Copa America 1999 performing football skills in a Brazilian-like kit. Daley was also a very talented mathematician, having been awarded certificates for being in the very top few in his age group in the country, and offered places at prestigious universities. He declined these, looking instead towards a career in the music industry.
