United sold top scorer Billy Dodds to Rangers at the start of December and immediately the club's fortunes changed. Sitting third in the league, the club would win only one of the next fourteen league games and three in total for the rest of the season. In fact, United lost 11 of the last 13 matches, consigning them to eighth place. Such was Dodds' impact that he finished top scorer, despite only playing the first four months of the season with the club.

Storyline.
10 February 1991
Mr. Conductor Jr. (Michael E. Rodgers) aka C. Junior is the cousin of Mr. Conductor, who was always on holiday at the beach. He is good-natured and friendly, but was also originally clumsy and lazy, preferring to relax and go surfing rather than do honest work. Mr. Conductor urged him to travel to Shining Time Station to retrieve the last of the family's gold dust. There, Junior met Lily, and they went to Sodor to find Mr. Conductor. They did find him at the windmill, but Junior became caught on the whirling blades of it, and was flung onto the back of Diesel 10's roof. He ended up in the scrap yard, flung onto James's cab. The two were nearly sent into the smelting pit, until Junior used the last of his gold dust to transport them away. Junior then reunited with Mr. Conductor, and told him that their gold dust was now completely gone. When Lady returned to the Island, Mr. Conductor and Junior found their gold dust again. Junior, pleased and encouraged by his success in helping out, offers to take a job on Sodor, and was hired on as conductor so that Mr. Conductor could go back to Shining Time Station and resume working there.

In an 11th hour effort to save the team from moving, a group of local investors headed by ex-Safeway magnate, Peter Magowan, offered Lurie $100 million for the Giants.
