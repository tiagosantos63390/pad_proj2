Warburton was elected at the 1977 election as the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Sandgate, succeeding Harold Dean who had held the seat for the ALP since 1960. In 1982, fellow opposition frontbencher Keith Wright deposed ALP leader Ed Casey in a secret ballot, after a string of poor election results. Warburton was appointed deputy opposition leader in Wright's shadow cabinet, despite having served only five years in parliament. Warburton became a member of the then dominant Trades and Labour Council faction, an affiliation he retained during his later career.

One of the cited changes suggested to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is intensification of the livestock industry, since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production. This assertion is supported by studies of the US beef production system, suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions, 12.1% less water use, and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than those used in 1977. However, these numbers included not only feedlots, but also feed production, forage-based cow-calf operations, backgrounding before cattle enter a feedlot, and animals culled from the dairy industry.
