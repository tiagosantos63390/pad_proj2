The Arrepentimiento Sector is located beside the highway running from El Chal to Santa Elena. It contains about 40 groups of structures concentrated upon karstic hills, with lesser occupation in low-lying areas. Settlement extends northwards from the highway for about until the dry riverbed of the Río El Chal. The majority of the architectural groups are located among cattle pasture. Some of the groups have been heavily looted, mostly those groups covered by dense vegetation. Those groups in open pasture have not been subject to looting but have suffered from the stripping of their stonework in order to use it in modern construction.
