It is characterized by large layers of urgoniennes rocks, where four waterfalls (from the top to the bottom: Cascade des Sources, Grande cascade, Cascade isolée, Pisse du Guiers) are dominated by limestone cliffs of an elevation of 500 meters. The water comes from Guiers Vif underground sources, historical border between the Dauphiné and the Kingdom of Savoy, and now this is the limit between the two departments of Savoie and Isère.

The concept of immediate perception of every musical metaphor is a problematic theory on Bernstein's part. Discussing the continuously overlapping metaphors, Bernstein says, “...with all this to be perceived... we still don’t require even that one millisecond before perceiving it” (p. 127). With countless overlapping and simultaneous metaphors, Bernstein argues that one hearing of the music alone is sufficient information to perceive all of them, and thus all humans can innately understand music. Obviously, this perception must happen subconsciously, because few could point out the metaphors individually, but surely many of these metaphors in music pass by undetected.
