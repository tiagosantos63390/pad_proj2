History.
Watters was selected as a pre-draft selection in the 1988 VFL Draft by West Coast after he won the fairest and best award for South Fremantle in 1987. He played 46 games for the Eagles over the next four seasons, including their first ever grand final appearance in 1991. However, when he was not selected in the 1992 premiership team, he was traded to Sydney as part of a deal which gave the Eagles the Number 1 draft pick, which they used to select Drew Banfield.
As a notable fitness expert, who advocated and lived the "perfect" diet and exercise regime, it was considered in the press to be a difficult message that he would die of heart disease at the relatively young age of 63. He had consulted a cardiologist who told him his left coronary artery (dubbed the "widowmaker" in medical jargon) was almost completely blocked and that he should have surgery immediately. Corea demurred, wanting to think about ita common reaction. He suffered a fatal heart attack that night. Corea had been sick for several weeks with what had been treated as a chest cold but was more likely congestive heart failure from two previous "silent" heart attacks. His family history was full of sudden cardiac related death. His father died at 36, his grandfather at 56 and his grandmother at 64 all from acute cardiac events. Corea never mentioned his family history of heart disease on the air and his death was a serious blow to his many fans and followers who lived, exercised and ate by his personal fitness regime. His death was compared to that of runner Jim Fixx. Like Fixx, his family had a history of heart disease, but it is possible that his lifestyle added many years to his life.
