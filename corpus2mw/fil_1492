At times in the 8th century, Gwent and Glywysing appear to have formed a single kingdom. Gwent may also have extended east of the River Wye into areas known as "Cantref Coch", which later became the Forest of Dean. Its eastern boundary later became established as the Wye, perhaps first determined by Offa of Mercia in the late 8th century, and certainly by Athelstan of England in 927. The area west of the River Usk was Gwynll≈µg, which formed part of Glywysing.
A note on the servomechanisms used on the Mk.1 and Mk.1A computers: These were electromechanical, using reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors and tungsten contacts. They were stabilized primarily by rotary magnetic drag (eddy-current) slip clutches, like high-torque versions of classical rotating-magnet speedometers. One part of the drag was geared to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly stiff spring. The latter part offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing velocity feedback. Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chattering when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, they also must have slowed down the servos somewhat.
