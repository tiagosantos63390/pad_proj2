Cells "in silico" are placed into this computational ecology and allowed to compete with each other for resources. The distribution of resources is set in a temporal dependent manner. During each round, random mutations and perturbations are introduced to the biochemical pathways. At the end of each round, the cells with the lowest energy count are eliminated. This selects for cells that are able to maximize energy uptake by optimizing the expression of its pathways in a particular time period.
