"Parapinnixa affinis" was first described by Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1900, in his "Synopsis of California stalk-eyed Crustacea". The type specimen was a single female, collected in July 1895 from Dead Man's Island, San Pedro, California (now part of the Port of Los Angeles); it was donated to the University of California. "P. affinis" no longer lives at the type locality, which has been made unsuitable by the accumulation of "harbor refuse and oil". No further specimens were collected for over thirty years, until one was collected in 1930, and Steve Glassell collected specimens including an allotype in 1932.
Platycypha pinheyi is a species of damselfly in family Chlorocyphidae. It is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania.
