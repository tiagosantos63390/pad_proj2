When he became a junior in 2008, Lawrence earned his spot as the field goal kicker for the Longhorns which he continued in his 2009 senior season as well. His most legendary kick came during the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. In the fourth quarter with one second put back on the clock, Nebraska held a 12-10 lead over the Longhorns. Coach Mack Brown sent Lawrence out on the field to attempt the game winning kick. From 46 yards out on the left hash mark Lawrence scored the winning field goal as time expired ending the game 12-13, thus securing the Longhorn's third Big 12 Championship, as well as a BCS National Championship Game berth.
