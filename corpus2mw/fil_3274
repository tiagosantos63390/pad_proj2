From as far back as 1904 there was rising concern about the West Indian Flamingo populations. During the 1960s the Bahamas National Trust formed the Inagua National Park. The Inagua National Park is the where the world's largest breeding colony of West Indian Flamingoes can be found. Forty years ago this flamingo species made a comeback from the brink of extinction to a colony of over 50,000 birds. The park has contributed to increasing bird populations in nearby islands such as Mayaguana, Acklins, Crooked Island, Cuba, and Andros. In 1997 the park was designated a wetland of international importance. It is also known as a bird watchers' paradise as it was designated an Important Bird Area.

In United States agricultural policy, Historic peanut producers are those producers who were actively involved in planting and harvesting peanuts in the 1998-2001 period. Under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1301-1310), only these historic producers are eligible to receive fixed direct payments and counter-cyclical payments under the new peanut program, irrespective of whether or not they continue to produce peanuts. Payments made to these producers are based on past production on historical acreage.
