Krasker was the first Australian-born cinematographer to win an Oscar; the second would not win until 1990.
After teaching theology and Eastern religions at the University of Dayton, Griffin came to appreciate the distinctively postmodern aspects of Whitehead’s thought. In particular, Griffin found Whitehead’s nonsensationist epistemology and panexperientialist ontology immensely helpful in addressing the major problems of modern philosophy, including the problems of mind-body interaction, the interaction between free and determined things, the emergence of experience from nonexperiencing matter, and the emergence of time in the evolutionary process. In 1973, Griffin returned to Claremont to establish, with Cobb, the Center for Process Studies at the Claremont School of Theology.
In the cities, suspected Whiteboy sympathisers were arrested and in Cork loyal citizens formed an association of about 2,000 strong which offered rewards of £300 for capture of the chief Whiteboy and £50 for the first five sub-chiefs arrested and often accompanied the military on their rampages. The leading Catholics in Cork also offered similar rewards of £200 and £40 respectively.
The development of tourism in the 19th century brought a demand for dance music in tea-rooms and hotels. Some local composers supplied songs and sheet music aimed at a tourist market.

Early Years.
Skaaland served in the U.S. Marines during World War II. After a short-lived attempt to make a living through boxing, he became a professional wrestler and debuted in 1946 as "Arnold Skaaland". Though competing under his real name, he was billed early in his career as hailing from Norway. Skaaland gained the nickname "The Golden Boy" and was known as a small, agile wrestler who relied on speed, wits, and toughness in the ring rather than size and strength.
This is a worn and eroded crater with an outer rim that has been somewhat distorted in shape due to nearby impacts. Several small craterlets lie along the rim and the sides. The interior floor has also been marked by impacts, including an eroded formation occupying the northwestern portion.

The Toronto Varsity Blues football team won the first Grey Cup game ever held in 1909, and went on to win the cup again in 1910, 1911, and 1920. After intercollegiate teams no longer competed for the Grey Cup, the team won the first Vanier Cup ever held in 1965, and then again in 1993 as Canadian national football champions. The team has 25 Yates Cup championship wins as champions of the Ontario University Athletics conference of the CIS, a total second only to the 29 won by the Western Ontario Mustangs.
Mars, a young and struggling cartoonist then, brought his superheroine idea as the Philippines’ answer to Superman to various publications both in the Philippines and in the United States but was rejected because publishers kept telling him "female superheroes will not sell". So Ravelo shelved his concept for the duration of the war. Years after the war, Ravelo realized the Filipinos were in need of a superhero so he again shopped his superheroine concept to publishers until one of them, Bulaklak Komiks ("Flower Comics") agreed to publish Ravelo's heroine that he now called "Varga" in 1947 (inspired by the Varga Girls series of illustrations) and the strip took off. Varga made her debut in "Bulaklak Magazine", Vol. 4, #17 on July 23, 1947 which Mars both wrote and drew himself. In an interview, Ravelo revealed that he offered his creation first to Liwayway Magazine and then to other publications but was rejected several times. And had not Liwayway magazine turned him down on his Varga (Darna’s predecessor character), history would have put Darna’s origin inside Liwayway’s pages instead of Bulaklak, and she would have been the Philippines’ first komiks superhero (Yes, at least one-a-half years ahead of Wonder Woman's first comics appearance!).
Public safety officers, such as those from the police, fire department, ambulance service, and customs, often wear peaked caps, especially on formal occasions. In the US, police forces use caps that have softer tops and are not round and rigid in form (notable are those worn in New York and San Francisco). British and Australian policemen have a checkerboard pattern on the cap band, and traffic wardens often have a reflective yellow strip.
Apart from a rotation about any one axis, in which the "xi" and "i" for some "i" coincide, the angles are not the same as Euler angles, and so the L matrices are not the same as the rotation matrices.

Amiga CD32 games often included long, cinematic intro sequences; the hardware was no more powerful than an Amiga 1200, but the 650 Mb of space on each CD could be easily filled with pre-rendered videos. The launch titles "Microcosm" and "" featured a long cinematic video, with "Super Stardust" and "Alien Breed: Tower Assault" following later.
Municipality has a population of 24,641 (census 2002), with an estimated 26,449 inhabitants on 31 December 2005 (124 per km²). Thanks to the immigration, it is one of the fastest growing areas of Belgrade, with an average annual growth of 2%. The rapid population growth is not followed by the equal development of infrastructure (good roads, waterworks, sewage system, waste disposal) even though in 2005 a construction of major water processing plant was finished. Two major traffic routes, the Ibarska magistrala (Highway of Ibar) and the railway Belgrade-Bar (Montenegro), are passing through the municipal territory.
There are several theories regarding the etymology of the term "Kurmi". It may be derived from an Indian tribal language, or may be a Sanskrit compound term "krishi karmi", "agriculturalist." Another theory holds that it was derived from "kṛṣmi", meaning "ploughman".
