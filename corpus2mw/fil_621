Weezer's self-titled debut album was released in 1994 and became a commercial and critical success. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo told "Rolling Stone" that success had "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me "–" 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this is the life I want to lead.'" Touring with Weezer, Cuomo had listened to the the operas "Aida" (1871) and "Madama Butterfly" (1904), the rock opera "Jesus Christ Superstar" (1970), and the musical "Les Misérables" (1980); he admired "how these works married music and drama, how the different characters would sing to each other instead of talk and how the story unfolded through song." He decided that a musical drama could be "the larger scale composition I wanted to write for Weezer's second record: a new-wave influenced rock musical in which I could explore my feelings about relationships, stardom, and my life in Weezer."
Gwee Li Sui in the eponymous book with the poem "Who wants to buy a book of Poems" refers to the stereotype used on poets as limp-wristed and "ah kua". In the poem, "Edward", he depicts the life of a cross-dresser during the time Bugis Street was being redeveloped.
Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from critics, with positive attention given to its lyrics. The album's energy level and Carey's vocal style, however, were almost unanimously criticized. Critics felt Carey became "too mellow" and "somewhat lazy" on the album, especially in comparison to her previous work, with Ron Wynn writing, "sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the album a generally positive review, calling it "another good collection of dance music and ballads" and writing that "the songwriting is generally high quality, and Nilsson's 'Without You' is a good choice for a cover". On a more critical note, however, Lamb described the album as a "toned down" album, and that Carey's upper registers aren't accessed as often as in previous releases, writing, "Mariah toned down the vocal gymnastics here, but she seemed to lose a lot of her energy as well. There are still strong songs here, but the overall effect is of a formula wearing a bit thin."
The name "Town of Newcastle" was used from 1973-94 for the municipality now called the Municipality of Clarington. The name was changed in 1994 to alleviate long standing confusion between the municipality as a whole and the community of the same name. The community was commonly known as "Newcastle Village" to distinguish the two. It was also a confusing fact that Bowmanville had a larger population than "Newcastle Village", and it also housed the former Town of Newcastle's municipal offices, causing some to believe the town should have been called "Bowmanville" instead of "Newcastle" during that period.
