Other than with walk-out or look-out basements, windows in basements require a well and are below grade. Clear window well covers may be required to keep the window wells from accumulating rain water. There should be drains in the window well, connected to the foundation drains.

"Gazette" is a loanword from the French language; in turn, the French word is a 16th-century permutation of the Italian "gazeta", which is the name of a particular Venetian coin. "Gazeta" became an epithet for "newspaper" during the early and middle 16th century, when the first Venetian newspapers cost one gazeta. (Compare with other vernacularisms from publishing lingo, such as the British "penny dreadful" and the American "dime novel".) This loanword, with its various corruptions, persists in numerous modern languages.
