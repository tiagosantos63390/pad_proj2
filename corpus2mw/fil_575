The show's first ten seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a small farming community. Fictional eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness with a succession of United States Forest Service Rangers. After traveling without human leads for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.

Sandman was a free music magazine launched in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in September 2002. Later versions were created, specifically covering Leeds, Kingston upon Hull, York, Nottingham and Manchester before all five editions were amalgamated into one compendium edition which also covered Manchester, Bradford, Derby and Leicester making Sandman the largest independent publication of its kind in the UK.

Initially the Cima was only available with the VH41DE, a short-stroke version of the VH45DE found in the first Infiniti Q45. The air suspension introduced in the previous generation was retained along with active suspension that was available on the USA-spec Infiniti Q45. Its appearance was said to reflect a more British appearance, both inside and out. An analog clock, found on most USA-spec Infinitis during the same time period, also appeared in this vehicle. AWD and a V8 engine were also added to the options list.
