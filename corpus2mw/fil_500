Weaker tornadoes, and at times even stronger tornadoes, can occasionally "lift", meaning their circulation has ceased to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the "house-skipping" effect is observed, except possibly at the time of the birth and organization of the tornado. There is not commonly observed and now a rarely applied term. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms this is a process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying in a process known as cyclic tornadogenesis leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell which are known as a tornado family.
What is snowball sampling?
