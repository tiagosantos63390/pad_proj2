Within developing countries, the local populace often stages protests against multinational corporations. Protesters insist that once allowed free rein the corporations will use their superior resources and experience to sway the political establishment of a country in favor of excessive concessions (tax holidays, underpaying for property, etc.) and try to influence the political system to fulfill corporate interests, which may or may not be shared by the citizenry. The concessions sought by these multinational corporations in turn collide with the free trade idea that subsidies should not be used to prop up corporations—in other words, subsidizing local corporations invites accusations of Protectionism by free trade proponents, while concessions to foreign corporations are portrayed as mere rational incentives.
