SYMPL was a programming language developed by the Control Data Corporation for use on the CDC 6000 series computer systems in the 1970s and 1980s. It was based on a subset of CDCs version of JOVIAL, as an alternative to assembly language. A number of important CDC software products were implemented in SYMPL, including compilers, libraries, a full-screen editor, and major subsystems.

New Zealand teams have dominated Super Rugby for much of its history, winning 11 of the 17 titles decided to date. The Crusaders are the most successful club, having won 7 titles in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2008. The Blues & the Chiefs are the other two New Zealand teams to have captured the title, Blues having won in 1996, 1997 and 2003, Chiefs winning the 2012 title and repeating the achievement in 2013. Australia's Brumbies (two titles), Reds (one) and NSW Waratahs (one) and South Africa's Bulls (three) are the only teams from outside New Zealand to have won a title.
