"Forza Horizon 2" again takes place during the fictional "Horizon Festival", this time being held in southern Europe, focusing on southern France and northern Italy. The game world has approximately three times more drivable area than that for the original "Forza Horizon", with events set in Provence, Tuscany and Côte d'Azur, among other regions. Players will explore the region, taking part in races and special events in order to advance through the game. Events can take place at day or night, and a dynamic weather system is being added for the first time in a "Forza"-series game.
