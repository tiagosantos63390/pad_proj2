Then, at the age of fifteen, the Benedictines awarded him 900 Guilders to study in Rome, where he attended at the Accademia di San Luca under Sebastiano Conca. He took further training in Venice with Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini and returned to Germany in 1718. Initially, he worked at Ottobeuren Abbey or in Füssen at St. Mang's Abbey, where he created ceilings and altarpieces. In 1725, he was appointed court painter by Anselm Reichlin von Meldegg, the Prince-abbot.

The Netflix Suro project has separate processing paths for data, but does not strictly follow lambda architecture since the paths may be intended to serve different purposes and not necessarily to provide the same type of views. Nevertheless, the overall idea is to make selected real-time event data available to queries with very low latency, while the entire data set is also processed via a batch pipeline. The latter is intended for applications that are less sensitive to latency and require a map-reduce type of processing.

Once synchronisation is achieved data can be transferred. The mark signal will be sent to the connected equipment so signal that the circuit is available. As characters are received at one end they will be inverted according to the marking pattern and checked for the present of three 1 (mark) symbols. If it is an error, a RQ character is sent on the return path. No characters are sent on from the receiver for a period of four character times. If an RQ character is received, then the transmitter will start a BQ-cycle in response, send an RQ character and repeat the last three characters sent. This phase of operation is called cycling as the same four characters will be recycled. Hopefully the receiver will have good reception of these and then forward them. If not the RQ will re sent again and repetition attempted.
