The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is just a repeat of the last line of the verse, which is always "won't you come see me Queen Jane". Each B line ends with a rhyme on "ain", while the A lines each end with a double-syllable rhyme, such as "cheek to / speak to" or "lent you / resent you". The music is recorded with a "warts and all" philosophy consistent with the rest of the "Highway 61 Revisited" album. The electric guitars are out of tune or out of phase and clash with the organ and piano chords, the bass has Spanish inflections, and the mix is raw with a sound similar to garage rock. Musicians on "Queen Jane Approximately" include Dylan, Mike Bloomfield on electric guitars and Al Kooper and Paul Griffin on keyboards.
Bill Moody first appears in a vision being interrogated by Fettel about Alma's location. Moody claims ignorance, which is supported by phone messages later in the game suggesting Moody knows nothing of the atrocities surrounding the Origin project, and that other Armacham employees ignore his concerns about his findings. Ian Hives, at one point, refuses to give Moody any information, later telling another employee named Janice to "act like you give a shit about his concerns." Moody is still barely alive when the Point Man finds him, but dies after warning him that Fettel is looking for Alma. Shortly after the player witnesses his death, Moody's phantom appears briefly.
