Ying Hu, author of "Tales of Translation: Composing the New Woman in China, 1899-1918", stated that Waldensee "much favored" Sai Jinhua "allegedly" due to Sai Jinhua's proficiency in several European languages. Ying Hu wrote that "Legend has it that in the "dragon bed" of the Empress Dowager, which Sai and Waldersee shared, she tried and sometimes succeeded in curbing the brutality of the troops."
