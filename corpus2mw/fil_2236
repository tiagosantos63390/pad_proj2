Description.
This manuscript consists of 155 leaves. Fols. 1r-153v contain a copy of Soul without the translatorâ€™s epilogue or a scribal colophon. The language shows characteristics associated by LALME with Northamptonshire. The craftsmanship of the manuscript indicates that it is the work of professional artists working in the middle of the fifteenth century. A partially erased inscription shows that the book was given to Henry Percy, prior of the Augustinian priory of St. Paul in Newham, Bedfordshire by his predecessor John Renhall in 1491.
In 1700 he succeeded Woodhouse, his former tutor, as Presbyterian minister at Little St. Helen's, Bishopsgate Street in the City of London. Here he enjoyed great popularity as a preacher, having much natural eloquence, and a gift of rapid composition with a strong pen. In 1705 he succeeded George Hammond as one of the Salters' Hall lecturers, and made this his first business when declining health compelled him to limit his work.
