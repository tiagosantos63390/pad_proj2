Sara Stewart of the "New York Post" gave the film three out of four stars, saying "Sure, it's not as novel as the first time we were here, but directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud stay true to the clever, slapstick vibe." James Berardinelli of "ReelViews" gave the film three out of four stars, saying ""Despicable Me 2" feels like a opportunity to get together with some old friends, hang out, and discover what they've been up to." Tom Russo of "The Boston Globe" gave the film a positive review, saying "The scope of the 'toon espionage-adventure goings-on is surprisingly limited. But the filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters, their creative joy is infectious." Stephanie Merry of "The Washington Post" gave the film three out of four stars, saying "The animation is beguiling, particularly when Lucy drives her car into the ocean, transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish."
