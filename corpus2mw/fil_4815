September 18 of the year 96 A.D. A perfect plan. A day designed to write the story. But everything goes wrong. Then we only improvise: a civil war, the Colosseum, the Praetorian Guard and border wars, poisonings, informers and poets, fighting in sand, Christians and martyrs, executions, the last disciple of Christ and the Apocalypse, the rise and fall of an imperial dynasty.
