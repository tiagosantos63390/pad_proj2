During the end of the Second World War, Kessell was based in Germany having been commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee (WAAC) as an official British war artist. Just three female war artists worked abroad during WWII; as one of them, Kessell was asked to document refugees "moving through Europe in the aftermath of the German surrender". She spent six weeks in Germany, from 9 August 1945 to 20 September, where she made charcoal drawings of refugees as well as keeping a diary of her experiences.

Contact with Europeans introduced new goods and materials that were extremely useful in everyday life. The acquisition of these goods transformed Wyandot society and by extension, the nature of their mortuary customs as well. In the pre-contact era, material grave offerings had been minimal, but the quantity and quality of material goods offered to the deceased became a sign of reverence. Significant grave offerings were expected as they demonstrated the generosity and wealth of the giver, as well as theoretically guaranteeing the goodwill of the deceased souls.

The game "Lemon Drops" features every week, where each celebrity helper played the Phat Contoller, and Lemon would be launched above the studio audience and drop soft, fluffy lemons with a prize inside into the audience.

Ellis Credle's artwork drew a comparison to Thomas Benton's in terms of "the undulating line, the surface agitation," as well as its "restless energy". The artwork in "Down Down The Mountain" is further praised for an appropriately "rough-hewn, deep-cleft, unfinished quality." The choices of blue and brown for the artwork and of brown again for the printed text are also noted for imparting a cheerful, individual look. "The New York Times" said in 1934 that Credle's illustrations have "zest and humor and a sympathetic understanding of the mountain country", and the same paper notes in later reviews the "sturdy simplicity" of her work as well as her "easy, fluid style".
She has received three Best Illustrated Book selections from the New York Times Book Review, in 1965 for "Sven's Bridge", in 1981 for "On Market Street", and in 2000 for "One Lighthouse, One Moon".

"On Market Street" also received a Caldecott Honor Book Award, a Boston Globe/Horn Book Award (illustration), and is an American Book Award finalist. "No Pretty Pictures" has also won many awards, including a National Book Award, a Judy Lopez Memorial Medal for Children's Literature, an Orbis Pictus Award, a Golden Kite Award, a Sydney Taylor Award Honor Book, a Booklist editor's choice, a River Bank Review Children's Books of Distinction finalist, an American Library Association Best Books for Young Adults citation, and a Gradiva Award for Best Memoir.
The English consuls were appointed by and affiliated with the Levant Company. The consuls were not in any way a representative for the crown, but merely representing the interests of the Company. It is interesting that if any issues arose with the Ottoman officials, the nation of merchants would meet with the consul to reach a decision on what to do and the company would never interfere in the decisions of the nation. It was not until 1605 that the Company gained the formal right to appoint consuls and vice consuls which were solely concerned with the nation of merchants who were members of the Company. If a consul was absent or died the vice consul would remain in charge until a new consul could be sent. England had the simplest hierarchy when it came to consular representation because the Company was in charge of the nation and consuls below, whereas the crown used other representation abroad.
"Continued Silence" has been highly praised by music critics. Jason Bracelin of the Las Vegas Review Journal and SPIN wrote, "'Silence' builds on the Dragons' climactic, dance floor-worthy swagger, with supersized, arms-in-the-air choruses and a buoyant groove amplified by the introduction of sub-hip-hop beats" Cincinnati CityBeat wrote "A quick spin through Continued Silence...is like panning in a creek bedded with gold nuggets; glints of Coldplay, Everclear, Train and any number of other chart-topping Pop icons, but with a discernibly beat-driven Indie edge. As epic as Homerian poetry set to a U2 soundtrack and as intimate as a candlelight dinner in the Nevada desert."
The small, slender shell has a golden brown color with slight lustre. The prominent oblique protoconch consists of but little over one whorl.

The Wolani or Wodani are a people in the Indonesian Paniai regency (kabupaten) of the Papua province (formerly Central Irian Jaya) of West Papua (western part of the island of New Guinea). Numbering about 5000 in 1992, they are farmers who live in the central highlands northeast of Lake Paniai, along the Kemandoga and Mbiyandogo rivers. Many Wolani converted to Christianity but, like elsewhere in Indonesia, they retain their traditional religion. They speak Wolani, which is affiliated with the western branch of the Trans–New Guinea languages, similar to the nearby Ekari and Moni languages.

An industrial forensics laboratory assists industry in interpreting and applying government guidelines and regulations throughout the manufacturing process. The laboratory recommends measures needed to handle environmental concerns to both workers and product. The laboratory can also determine sources of pollutants during the manufacturing process that may affect the working environment and can design sampling and collection plans to monitor that process.
