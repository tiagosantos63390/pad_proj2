On Monday 13 May 2013, Melbourne Victory announced their first signing of the season by signing Brisbane Roar Mitch Nichols on two-year deal, reuniting him with his former Roar manager Ange Postecoglou. He became Postecoglou’s first new signing ahead of the 2013/14 A-League season. On 9 June it was speculated that Melbourne Victory is the prime club looking to sign Greek national team captain, Giorgos Karagounis, after it was confirmed he was to be released by Premier League club Fulham. After it was confirmed the Karagounis talks had come to a halt, Fulham then had second thoughts about the release and decided to pursue Karagounis' signature, which in the end they did. Argentine Marque player Marcos Flores was released with mutual consent on 5 July. Following Flores' departure to Central Coast Mariners, Victory attempted to sign Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli as their marquee player however he signed with U.S. Lecce. Following these two disappointments for the Melbourne Victory stakeholders, the victory hosted one of the most notable sporting events in Australian Sporting history. This game was Melbourne Victory against Liverpool at the MCG in front of +95,400 spectators. The full Liverpool squad was brought to Melbourne, including stars such as Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez, Kolo Touré, Simon Mignolet, and Brad Jones. Melbourne lost the game 0-2 in what was considered a 'thriller', and has since sparked rumours of the development of a sister club relationship. Following the Liverpool match, Kosta Barbarouses was signed on a 3 year deal. On 17 September, Adrian Leijer handed over the captaincy role to Mark Milligan. Following two failed marquee signing attempts, Melbourne finally got their marquee on 22 September 2013, signing Chile international Pablo Contreras. Days after the signing of Contreras, Melbourne secured Socceroo James Troisi on a one-year loan deal from Italian club Atalanta. Brent McGrath trialled for the Victory following a failed trial with Melbourne Heart, but nothing came of it in Melbourne, only to sign with Adelaide United weeks later. Andreas Govas trained and made a few appearances for the Victory in pre-season games, but was later confirmed that he "wanted to keep fitness".
