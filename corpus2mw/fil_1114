Previously failing in modern country and rock formats, the current format was adopted in the mid-1980s under the leadership of Ned Horton. Since then, the format has been "tweaked" on numerous occasions.

A small hairpin RNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a sequence of RNA that makes a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of shRNA in cells is typically accomplished by delivery of plasmids or through viral or bacterial vectors. The promoter choice is essential to achieve robust shRNA expression. At first, polymerase III promoters such as U6 and H1 were used; however, these promoters lack spatial and temporal control. As such, there has been a shift to using polymerase II promoters to regulate expression of shRNA. shRNA is an advantageous mediator of RNAi in that it has a relatively low rate of degradation and turnover. However, shRNA is disadvantageous in that it requires use of an expression vector which can pose safety concerns.

The W-71 nuclear warhead was a US thermonuclear warhead developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and deployed on the LIM-49A Spartan missile, a component of the Safeguard Program, an anti-ballistic missile(ABM) defense system briefly deployed by the US in the 1970s. The warhead was designed to intercept a cloud of incoming enemy warheads after their carrying missile's boost phase, at altitudes comparable to low earth orbit where there is practically no air, an environment which permits the passage of essentially all of the X-rays generated by the nuclear explosion. As part of the Safeguard ABM program the W71 was to serve as the first line of defense and as a complement to the other Safeguard missile-warhead pairing, the Sprint missiles enhanced neutron radiation warhead, the W66.
Furthermore, it is not difficult to retrospectively criticise a theory. Priem and Butler (2001a) were arguably ten years too late in their critique of Barney's (1991) framework. In the process, they engaged in and instigated a rather superfluous debate instead of focussing on really important issues facing senior managers.
The fact that the sale back to Vam was for exactly what Mullens had paid out seems to have been a happy coincidence, i.e. that the market price was exactly that amount at the time; the price later fell to $0.30.

Despite its success, "Justified & Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)" was the final release by the KLF through retail channels as well the second-to-last altogether release from the KLF (the last release being the mail-order only "3 a.m. Eternal") before Drummond and Cauty quit the music business and retired the KLF name.
"Al Unser Jr.'s Road to the Top" is a racing video game released exclusively for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
In another multiplayer variant, players are simply removed from the round for a foul.
