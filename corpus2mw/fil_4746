Schedule.
William called a Scottish Convention, which convened on 14 March in Edinburgh. Initially William's supporters did not have a clear advantage and the Marquis of Hamilton, chosen by William to represent him, only gained the presidency over the Marquess of Atholl, who was associated with James, by a narrow margin. The faction that supported James, including many Episcopalians and led by figures including John Paterson, the Archbishop of Glasgow, were divided by James' previous attempts to achieve tolerance for Roman Catholics. A letter from James, received on 16 March, contained a threat to punish all who rebelled against him and declared the assembly illegal. This resulted in his followers abandoning the Convention, leaving the Williamites largely unopposed. William's supporters had control of the burgh, but Edinburgh Castle, with its formidable arsenal, was held by the Catholic Earl of Gordon. With Dundee raising troops in the Highlands, the convention met in a highly charged political atmosphere, behind closed doors and guarded by some 1,000 Cameronians.

Early life.
Following the approval of the Dodgers television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014 that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of spring training and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games will be televised by the new network. At least 75 games broadcast by the network in the 2014 season will be simulcast in Spanish; the network does plan to eventually televise all its games in Spanish in the future. While the network is not directly branded with the Dodgers' name, its logo incorporates a depiction of the Dodgers' interlocking "LA" insignia; team co-owner Todd Boehly stated that the decision was "something Warner Cable thought was really valuable to their brand. We have the flexibility to sit down and evolve the name over time."
