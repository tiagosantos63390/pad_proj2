On August 11 the Belarus KGB issued summons to the three Swedish organizers of the airdrop, Tomas Mazetti, Hannah Frey and Per Cromwell, to come to Belarus for questioning about the operation within 10 days. The summons were posted on the Belarus KGB website and delivered to Studio Total by e-mail and stated that failure to comply could result in "correctional work for up to two years, or imprisonment for up to six months." Studio Total refused to comply with the summons and instead offered to discuss the airdrop operation directly with President Lukashenko if he visits Sweden.

The library made its two copies of the Glossary accessible to readers only in early 2012, after the regionally authority, withdrew this extrajudicial ban, claiming that the library had never been bound by the authority's 'advice' on the Glossary. Furthermore, the library admitted that it was the first time in its history that a book in its holdings was made inaccessible to readers.
