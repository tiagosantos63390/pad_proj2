When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined "New Horizons" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as "Horns of Hattin" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as "Ein Gedi" (1950s), "Sheep of the Negev" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.
History of the Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House.

In 1823, the Gossler family sold the property to Wilhelm Schröder, who was married to Salomon Heine's eldest daughter Fanny. Their grandson Otto Nanne owned the property from 1872 to 1906, when he sold it to the factory owner August Herbst. Due to financial difficulties, Herbst sold the property to the Hamburg government in 1928–29. Since 1937, the manor house has been listed as a cultural heritage site. The park had by 1957 been reduced to 4800 m². The manor house was officially given the name "Stavenhagenhaus" in honour of the poet Fritz Stavenhagen in 1962, with a ceremony presided over by Helmut Schmidt. However, Stavenhagen has no association with the house's history and the building is also referred to as the "Frustberg" or as the "Tiefbrunn House". The name "Gossler House" has also been used. The building is used for cultural events such as concerts.
