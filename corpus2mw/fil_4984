Coalbed methane received a major push from the US federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.

Temerario joined the Washington Redskins as an assistant coach in 1960, overseeing the ends and the defense at different stages through 1965. He became the Redskins' head of pro player personnel in 1966 and served in that position for 13 years until his retirement in 1978. In 1975, he considered bringing in professional wrestler André the Giant for a tryout in training camp. Temerario called and then canceled a press conference with the 7-foot-four-inch wrestler, which led to speculation that he had been signed. Temerario, however, said he had only pondered the possibility and that André the Giant's salary requirements made the move impossible. He was then making about $200,000 a year ($ in dollars). The Redskins never had a winning season while Temerario was an assistant coach, although the team advanced to the playoffs five times during his career as an executive. The team reached Super Bowl VII in 1972, but lost to the Miami Dolphins.
