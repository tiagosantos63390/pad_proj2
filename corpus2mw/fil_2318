After twelve appearances in the first season, Ellie disappeared with no explanation offered the audience. Over the years Donahue offered multiple explanations for her departure from the show. In one she believed that she and Griffith lacked the chemistry to make their on-screen romantic relationship credible and she decided to leave.
