"Underlyingly", each syllable of every morpheme may be described as having one of two tone types: high (H [ ¯ ]) and null (ø). On the surface, all remaining null tones default to low (the LTA rule below) and the language is therefore spoken with two contrasting tonemes (H and L).

Mere Theory's debut full-length album, "Catalan Atlas" was released via a license deal with Melbourne based Boomtown Records in September 2007. The album received favourable reviews including Rolling Stone, BLUNT and The Adelaide Advertiser. In BLUNT issue No. 66, Catalan Atlas was dubbed one of the "Top 100 Albums You Should've Heard In 2007." Their review went on to say "They had already released two fairly decent EPs, but Adelaide foursome Mere Theory took a giant leap in 2007 with their debut album, "Catalan Atlas". Taking all the best bits from the likes of Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas Is The Reason and Elliott, then integrating them into their own Oz punk stylings, Mere Theory came out with a rock album of international standard."

Björk — "It's Oh So Quiet" (Choreographer: Michael Rooney)
On 21 March 1945 the ship sailed for Mobile, Alabama where she was placed out of commission on 31 March to be fitted out as a landing craft repair ship by the Alabama Drydock & Shipbuilding Company. The conversion was completed that summer, and USS "Bellerophon" (ARL-31) was recommissioned on 21 July 1945 at Mobile with Lieutenant Samuel H. Alexander, USNR, in command. On 31 July the ship began a fortnight's shakedown cruise that took her to Galveston, Texas. She returned to Mobile on 14 August and began preparations for an overseas deployment. On 1 September "Bellerophon" departed Mobile and headed for the Pacific Ocean. After transiting the Panama Canal, she headed up the west coast toward San Francisco. She made a stop at San Diego before arriving at Treasure Island on 3 October. There, the ship began duty as the repair ship for a newly formed boat pool. When a strike by civilian workers paralyzed civilian yards during the latter part of October, "Bellerophon" began making voyage repairs to Operation Magic Carpet ships while also carrying out some conversion work to enable attack cargo ships to serve as passenger carriers.

On July 31, 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.
