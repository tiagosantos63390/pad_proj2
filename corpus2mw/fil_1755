All the guests in the theatre move rhythmically to the music. We can see Helen Hayes, William Powell, Chester Morris, Gloria Swanson, and George Arliss in the audience. In the next close-up scenes the viewer can identify Jimmy Durante, Wallace Beery, Marie Dressler, Rudy Vallee, Joan Crawford, Will H. Hays (dressed as a king in reference to his position as "“Censorship Czar”") and Myrna Loy. Ed Wynn, Wheeler & Woolsey, Laurel & Hardy all laugh with the cartoon. Bela Lugosi (dressed as Count Dracula), Fredric March (dressed as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)) and Boris Karloff (dressed as the Frankenstein's monster) do the same, but with spooky evil laughter. Joe E. Brown laughs so loud that his enormous mouth opens wide, while Buster Keaton keeps his poker face. Jimmy Durante and Douglas Fairbanks laugh so loud that they literally "roll in the aisles". They are joined in by Groucho Marx, Joe E. Brown, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Oliver Hardy. As the cartoon ends the whole audience applauds and congratulates Mickey with his success. But Mickey is so shy that he has to be pulled on the stage by Will Rogers with a rope. All the Hollywood actors now shake Mickey’s hands (and feet!) to congratulate him with his success. Then Greta Garbo walks onto the stage and starts covering Mickey’s face with kisses. Mickey wakes up in his bed, while Pluto is licking his face. Mickey wonders if he was dreaming.

The alley is named after the former tavern "Storkällaren" ("Great basement"), in its turn named after the vicinity to the cathedral Storkyrkan. The tavern was located under the town house, where the present Stock Exchange Building is found. The town hall was relocated to the Bonde Palace at Riddarhustorget in 1730, and when the old building was demolished in 1767, the tavern moved to Svartmangatan. The name of the alley survived in various forms: ""Stora Källaregränden", "St. Källarbrinken" (1733), "Stora Kiällare-Gränden" (1740), "Källar-Gränd" (1855). Together with the inauguration of the stock exchange a new tavern was opened, which remained in business until 1906.

Lynnewood Hall suffered a general decline under the ownership of the Faith Theological Seminary, a religious group headed by Carl McIntire, which purchased it in 1952 for $192,000. During that ownership much interior detailing, such as mantels, walnut paneling, and landscape ornamentation was sold off in order to raise funds. This is evidenced by the 2006 auction of a French bronze figural fountain—one of only two major surviving Henri-Leon Greber commissions in America—originally installed at Lynnewood Hall.
