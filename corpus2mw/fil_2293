History.
Background.
Later modifications of MFT-II added "sub-tasking", so that the fixed number of tasks was no longer fixed, although the number of partitions did remain a limitation.
An auditor earns a living from the fee he is paid it is therefore automatic that he does not want to do anything to jeopardize this income. This reliance on clients’ fees may affect the independence of an auditor. If the auditor feels this client income is more important than their responsibilities to shareholders he may not perform the audit with the shareholder’s interests in mind. The larger the fee income the more likely the auditor is to shirk his responsibilities and perform the audit without independence. This could lead to the manipulation of figures and exploitation of accounting standards. By performing the audit without independence the shareholders’ may get misled, as the auditor is now reliant on the directors. To encourage auditors to maintain their independence they must be protected from the director’s board. If they were able to challenge statements and figures without the risk of losing their job they would be more likely to work with complete independence. Ultimately, as long as the client determines audit appointments and fees an auditor will never be able to have complete economic independence.

"I'm Your Witchdoctor" is a cover of a John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers song, which the band also performed in their early 1977/8 sets. "Instro" is the only original composition here and is a rare instrumental from the band; perhaps the lack studio time prevented them from writing lyrics and recording vocals, or maybe they deemed it unworthy of completion.

Scoring Drives:
The album did receive some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of "slidpast notes and draw[ing out the final syllables of lines are signatures indistinguishable from tics". "Entertainment Weekly"'s Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's "delicate upper range is nicely attuned to some of the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss". Mark Edwards of "The Times" called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his "trademark delivery" is "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, "Ain't nobody perfect".
