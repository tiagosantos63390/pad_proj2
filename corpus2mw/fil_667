Đoàn Minh Huyên, a native of Sa Đéc (now Đồng Tháp) province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, came to be known as the "Buddha Master of Western Peace" ("Phật Thầy Tây An") during the cholera epidemic in 1849, which killed over a million people. Huyên was reputed to have supernatural abilities to cure the sick and the insane. His followers wore amulets bearing the Chinese characters for "Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương", a phrase that became identified, retrospectively, with the religion practiced by Huyên, and the millenarian movement associated with the latter.
