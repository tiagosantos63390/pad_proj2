Architecturally, the station resembles North Wootton station, with a small main station building on the up platform and a small waiting room provided on the down platform; both had Great Easternâ€“style canopies. A small goods yard adjoined the main station building, and a standard Great Eastern gabled signal box was sited on the southern end of the down platform. A level crossing lay at the northern end of the station and, in common with other stations on the line, convenient lodging accommodation, a solidly built Carstone inn known as "The Alexandra Hotel", was to be found opposite the station approach.
