At the instant of engine failure, the main rotor blades are producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack and velocity. By immediately lowering collective pitch, which must be done in case of an engine failure, the pilot reduces lift and drag and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, producing an upward flow of air through the rotor system. This upward flow of air through the rotor provides sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rpm throughout the descent. Since the tail rotor is driven by the main rotor transmission during autorotation, heading control is maintained as in normal flight. 
Report.
Buksh was a nominated member of the Legislative Council of Fiji in 1947, as an Indian nominated member by the Governor. He is remembered for an incident which caused a rift between A. D. Patel and Vishnu Deo. In 1948, when the Governor asked the five Indian members of the Legislative Council to elect one from amongst themselves to be a member of the Executive Council, A.D. Patel and Vishnu Deo both put forward their names. (The member elected into the Executive Council would have been recognised as the leader of the Indian community.) Ami Chandra supported Vishnu Deo, whereas James Madhavan, supported A.D. Patel. Buksh regarded both Patel and Deo as capable and could not make up his mind as to whom to support. Fully aware that Buksh did not regard himself as worthy of the position, A.D. Patel nominated him. Flattered with this support, Buksh returned the favour and threw his support behind Patel. Buksh said afterwards, “I garlanded him with the garland he offered me.”
