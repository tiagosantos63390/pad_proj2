Track listing.
Chance's debut album has received mixed to positive reviews. "Us Magazine" rewarded Chance with three stars and a positive review, claiming that he "outdoes himself with 10 originals". "Entertainment Weekly" gave Chance a positive review as well by complimenting his mature voice saying, "Chance reveals a surprisingly mature voice on 'Hold On 'Til the Night' ('Heart Like Stone' provides a welcome touch of outsider brooding), though the Facebook-spurred melodrama of 'Unfriend You' reminds listeners that he is, after all, just a kid." The overall grade for the album was a B. PopCrush website also wrote a positive review giving Chance four stars. Scott Shetler writes, "the resulting debut album is a 10-song collection that sounds a lot more grown-up than you might expect from such a fresh-faced youngster". John Terauds of the "Toronto Star" gave it three-and-a-half stars, writing that "the boy's debut 10-track album is a solid effort that owes a massive debt to the boy bands of the 1990s" and ended with, "This YouTube phenom is standing on solid artistic ground here."
