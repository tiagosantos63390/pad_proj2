From the time of its opening through the decade of the 1980s, it was one of the most popular and upscale shopping destinations in Columbus, drawing in customers from the affluent northern suburbs of the city. A food court was added in a further expansion in around 1990, replacing a Woolworths that had just vacated, and the main mall's facade was updated. During the 1990s, however, the mall began a steady decline caused by the introduction of newer shopping options in the Greater Columbus area. The first new mall in the area in 20 years, the downtown Columbus City Center, opened in 1989 and included several tenants that were unique in the Columbus area (among them Marshall Field's and Jacobson's), which took some business from Northland. However, it remained popular with shoppers in the northern half of Columbus, and continued to be an attractive destination for those who found City Center's downtown location (and paid parking) a hindrance.
A group of children from a London tower block who were sent on holiday to an outdoor activities centre called Felfront Heights, along with their social worker. The first series revolved around their adventures at the centre. In the second series, the children found that the centre had been closed down so the social worker took them to a local village. They became involved with a witch finder, who had spent hundreds of years tracking down a local witch (who turned out to be Mrs Dears, the old lady who ran the local shop). The children travelled into the past, thanks to a time-travelling ambulance, in order to prevent Mrs Dears becoming a witch in the first place. When they returned to the present, the children realised that they had inadvertently changed the course of time, and the present was significantly different from how they had left it—most shockingly, they realised they had stopped America from being discovered by Europeans, and consequently, and paradoxically, there was no such thing as television.

The girls of St. Trinian’s hatch yet another fiendish plot — a trade union for British schoolgirls. Their friend and mentor, Flash Harry, suggests a plan which involves kidnapping girls from other rather more respectable colleges and substituting their own "agents". Thus begins a hilarious, often bloody, battle of wits as the girls meet resistance not only from Olga Vandermeer, their Headmistress, but from the Minister of Education, a private detective and an oil sheikh. Despite all his desperate efforts to foil the conspiracy, the Minister has to face a growing realisation that the girls’ demands will have to be met — for him this will mean a very great and very personal sacrifice.

Commercially the album was well received, opening at number five on the UK album charts, but faded away quickly. However, after the Mercury nomination the album saw a revival to gain gold status, with its second single "One Day Like This" re-entering the top 40 singles listing after the award win. The album had a steady chart run afterwards (including a re-entry in the top ten), enabling it to benefit from the busy Christmas market, and eventually reach over 300,000 sales, making it eligible for platinum status. It has since sold 860,000 as of September 2011.
Most of WCCM's programming is syndicated, including America's Radio News Network and Don Imus. Spanish-language programming is aired on weekends, with the exception of "Music and Memories" (an adult standards show) and "The Italian Show". WCCM is only licensed to operate from local sunrise until 30 minutes after local sunset (the latter with reduced power); this is to protect WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina. However, in the fall and winter months, it is not unusual for WCCM to be heard before sunrise. On election day, November 6, 2012, WCCM stayed on the air well past local sunset to broadcast election results in the Merrimack Valley areas of New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
