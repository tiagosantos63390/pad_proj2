Of aristocratic background, Déodat de Séverac was profoundly influenced by the musical tradition of his native Languedoc. He is noted for his vocal and choral music, which include settings of verse in Provençal (the historic language of Languedoc) and Catalan (the historic language of Roussillon) as well as French poems by Verlaine and Baudelaire. His compositions for solo piano have also won critical acclaim, and many of them were titled as pictorial evocations and published in the collections "Chant de la terre", "En Languedoc", and "En vacances". A popular example of his work is "The Old Musical Box" in B-flat major, but his masterpiece is the suite "Cerdaña" (written 1904—1911), filled with the local color of Languedoc. His motet "Tantum ergo" is also still sung on occasion.
Nanaimo Station of the SkyTrain system is an elevated railway station located on the Expo Line in East Vancouver.
He also analyzes the revival of Confederate military virtue in the US armed forces. Kaplan was embedded with U.S. troops in Iraq and wrote an often-cited report for "The Atlantic" entitled "Five Days in Fallujah" about the spring 2004 campaign. In June 2005, he wrote the cover story for the "The Atlantic" titled "How We Would Fight China", which suggests the inevitability of a Cold War-type situation between the US and China. In October 2006, he wrote "When North Korea Falls" for the same magazine in which he examines the prospect of North Korea's collapse and the effect on the balance of power in Asia in favor of China.
In August 2006, a Nashville judge ordered Cagle to pay approximately $737,000 to former manager Mark Hybner, whom Chris had sued in 2004 in an effort to void management and publishing deals he had signed in 1999.
The years in North Carolina were not successful for her, as the police started busting the clubs she would perform in and shut them down. When she wasn't performing she was working as a waitress at her mother-in-law's restaurant. By 1984, she was singing in a club and was singing country music for a change of the rock she would normally perform. There was a new generation of artists in Nashville, singers like Ricky Skaggs and Emmylou Harris who were changing the traditions of country music.
Griffiths' film roles were in both contemporary and period pieces such as "Gorky Park" (1983), "Withnail and I" (1987), "King Ralph" (1991), "" (1991), "Guarding Tess" (1994) and "Sleepy Hollow" (1999). Later, he was seen as Harry Potter's cruel uncle Vernon Dursley in the "Harry Potter" series ("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1".

P680, or Photosystem II primary donor, (where P stands for pigment) refers to any of the 2 special chlorophyll dimers (also named special pairs), PD1 or PD2. These 2 special pairs form an excitonic dimer, which means that they behave in function as a single entity; i.e., they are excited as if they were a single molecule. The 680 number is its absorption maximum in the red part of the visible spectrum (680 nm). The primary donor receives excitation energy either by absorbing a photon of suitable frequency (colour) or by excitation energy transfer from other chlorophylls within photosystem II. During excitation, an electron is excited to a higher energy level. This electron is subsequently captured by the primary electron acceptor, a pheophytin molecule located within photosystem II near P680. The oxidized P680 (P680+) is subsequently reduced by an electron originating from water (via Oxygen evolving complex).

Desmosomes can be visualized as rivets through the plasma membrane of adjacent cells. Intermediate filaments composed of keratin or desmin are attached to membrane-associated attachment proteins that form a dense plaque on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Cadherin molecules form the actual anchor by attaching to the cytoplasmic plaque, extending through the membrane and binding strongly to cadherins coming through the membrane of the adjacent cell.
