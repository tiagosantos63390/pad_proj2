At the time of their succession to power, Denmark under King Waldemar IV of Denmark was at war with the Hanseatic League and its allies, in particular Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg. The late Duke Barnim III had sided with Denmark. His sons, however, made peace with Albert on 7 November 1368 and took a neutral stance towards Denmark. This brought them into conflict with Margrave Otto of Brandenburg, who sided with Denmark. This conflict escalated to war. Duke Casimir III died during the siege of Chojna in 1372.

Just two seasons after being English champions, Ipswich were relegated from the First Division in last place. Although Ipswich were capable of scoring - the team found the net at least once in all but eight of the 42 First Division they played during the season - their defence was what let the team down, conceding 121 goals in 42 league games. As of 2011 this remains the highest number of goals ever conceded by Ipswich in a season.
