Smoke tests can be broadly categorized as functional tests or unit tests. Functional tests exercise the complete program with various inputs. Unit tests exercise individual functions, subroutines, or object methods. Both functional testing tools and unit testing tools tend to be third-party products that are not part of the compiler suite.

Unit tests can be implemented either as separate functions within the code itself, or else as a driver layer that links to the code without altering the code being tested.
