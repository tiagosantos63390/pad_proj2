The final rule published on May 14, 1993, requires that refrigerant sold to a new owner be reclaimed to the ARI Standard 700 of purity by a certified reclaimer (Sec. 82.154(g) and (h) referencing standard in Sec. 82.164 and the definition of reclaim found in Sec. 82.152).

The children and wife of Bhutto were given asylum by Gaddafi in the 1980s, despite the agitation of President Zia.

She was therefore one of a particular group of leading singers who in this way helped to establish a new artistic trend, which soon evolved into 'the Rossini grand finale' of an entire musical era.
