A Cem Evi / Cemevi (pronounced and sometimes written as Djemevi) means literally "a house of gathering" in Turkish or more precisely "house of religious ritual called cem" and is a place of fundamental importance for Turkey's Alevi-Bektashiyyah tariqa populations and traditions. According to Presidency of Religious Affairs of Turkey, it is not a place of worship "(due to the fact that Laïcité in Turkey cannot allow by laws any one of those like Imambargah, Khalwatkhana, Mejlis, Musallah or Tekkes except Sunni and Ja'fari-Shi’ite mosques as Muslim worship places)" in the strict sense of the term despite Alevi organizations such as "Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli Anadolu Kültür Vakfı" demands cemevi as places for worshiping to be officially recognized.
