Way also stated that he felt helpless because of communication with Interscope was lacking, and he believed the label failed to listen to him. He claims that his souring relationship with producer and mentor Mr. Collipark, who for the first time did not do any production work on Way's album, gave him less power to negotiate with record execs.

Description
The gameplay is similar to the game Gauntlet. Gameplay is depicted from a top-down perspective and players fire projectiles at enemies. Players can collect atoms to purchase power-ups and healing items between levels. Every level consists of two levels set in a specific setting usually appropriate with horror films (e.g., a cemetery, a laboratory). After completing those levels, the player must complete a trial level, where they must achieve a certaint objective. Failure to complete the trial levels results in having to fight a boss.
