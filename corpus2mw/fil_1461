Sexual arousal is an aspect of a person's sexuality and a part of sexual excitement. It is accompanied by physiological changes in the aroused person. It is difficult to conceal full sexual arousal, or indeed lack of it, while fully nude. Penile erection is an obvious indicator of sexual excitement of a male; while in the case of a female, physiological changes such as vaginal lubrication and swelling, coloring and engorgement of the labia and clitoris, may be less visible to others.
