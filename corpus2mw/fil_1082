There was, amongst the Salwas, a virtuous Kshatriya king known by the name of Dyumatsena. And it came to pass that in course of time he became blind. And that blind king possessed of wisdom had an only son. And it so happened that an old enemy dwelling in the vicinity, taking advantage of the king’s mishap, deprived him of his kingdom. And thereupon the monarch, accompanied by his wife bearing a child on her breast, went into the woods. His son, born in the city, began to grow in the hermitage. The Brahmanas have named the son Satyavan. In his childhood he took great delight in horses, and used to make horses of clay. And he used also to draw pictures of horses. And for this that youth is sometimes called by the name of Chitraswa. The Madra princess Savitri knew about this prince and fell in love with him. Later she married him. Dyumatsena's minister somehow slew the enemy king and Dyumatesena regained his kingdom.

Fito Cabrales, former vocalist to Spanish rock group Platero y Tú, left the reasonably successful group in 1998 in search of a new sound. Cabrales formed his own group, calling it Fito & Fitipaldis. Striving to synthesize such elements as soul, pop, swing, flamenco, Tex-Mex, and Latin jazz, Cabrales claims that "everything has a place in this emotional, complex-free music." Signing with DRO Atlantic, Fito & Fitipaldis released their first disc, A Puerta Cerrada (A Closed Door) in 1998, and their second, Los sueños locos (The Crazy Dreams) in 2001. The group's 2003 release, Lo más lejos a tu lado (The Farthest from Your Place) achieved great success, reaching number two on the national charts during its first two weeks, and exceeding sales projections considerably. Cabrales and friends toured extensively throughout Spain and beyond, playing some of Europe's most important venues. In 2006 Fito & Fitipaldis released Por la boca vive el pez (Fish Live by the Mouth) and are now among Spain's most popular performing artists. Cabrales' free-spirited approach to songwriting is easily summarized: "I would like everybody to understand these songs their own way. They are just songs. So much work, so much worrying, so much thinking about them and finally...they are just songs."
