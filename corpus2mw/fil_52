As the brothers transitioned out of the family act and into a duo, they moved to Nashville and Atkins became an early champion of the Everly Brothers. Despite his affiliation with RCA Records, it was Atkins who arranged a chance for the Everly Brothers to record for Columbia Records in early 1956.

Australian Fairy Wrens such as the beautiful blue Variegated Wren and the brilliant red and black Red-backed Wren both occur here.
