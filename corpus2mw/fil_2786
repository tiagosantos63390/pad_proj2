A "contract of affreightment" is a contract between a "ship-owner" and another person (called the "charterer"), in which the ship-owner agrees to carry goods for the charterer in the ship, "or" to give the charterer the use of the whole or part of the ship's cargo-carrying space for the carriage of goods on a specified voyage or voyages or for a specified time.
