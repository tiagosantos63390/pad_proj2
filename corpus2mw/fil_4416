With their win over Kent State in the MAC Championship Game on November 30, NIU moved to 12–1, the most regular-season wins in the program's 113-year history. NIU also moved to No. 15 in the final Bowl Championship Series rankings, while Big East champion Louisville was No. 21. Since the MAC is a non-AQ conference, its conference champion must finish 16th or higher and be ranked ahead of at least one AQ conference champion to qualify for a BCS game. As a result, NIU played in the Orange Bowl against Florida State. It was the first major-bowl appearance in school history, as well as the first-ever major-bowl appearance for a MAC team.
