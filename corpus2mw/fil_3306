For decades, "Wireless World" was a place where pioneers in audio and electronic design shared ideas. In 1947-49, it published articles on building what became the famous "Williamson amplifier" by D.T.N Williamson - using a pair of triode-connected KT66 kinkless power tetrodes (very similar to the American 6L6) in push-pull to give 15 watts output. In 1952 it made the first public announcement of the Baxandall tone control circuit, a design now employed in millions of hi-fi systems including amplifiers and effects for musical instruments. In 1955 it published the design of the popular Mullard 5-10 audio amplifier using two EL84 power pentodes in ultra-linear push-pull configuration. In the 1960s and 1970s there were many further articles on advances in audio and electronic design, notably all-transistor designs including the 'Tobey-Dinsdale Amplifier' and the 'Linsley Hood' power amplifier. In 1975/6 "Wireless World" published the design of a decoder of broadcast TV Teletext information before the first commercial decoder became available. Later it published regular columns of brief "Circuit Ideas".

He was a great-grandson of William Biddle, I (1630–1712), and Sarah Kempe (1634–1709), Quakers who emigrated to America in 1681. William Biddle was one of the Proprietors of West Jersey, and for many years a member of the Governor's Council of that colony. Owen was a grandson of William Biddle, II (1660–1743), and son of John Biddle, I, (1707–1789), who moved to Philadelphia about 1725 with his brother, William Biddle, III (b. 1698–1756). His father prospered as a merchant. After eight years of formal education, Owen Biddle became a clock and watchmaker.
